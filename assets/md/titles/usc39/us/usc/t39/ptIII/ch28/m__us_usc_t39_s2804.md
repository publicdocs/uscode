## § 2804. Program performance reports

    (a) The Postal Service shall prepare a report on program performance for each fiscal year, which shall be included in the annual comprehensive statement presented under [section 2401(e) of this title][/us/usc/t39/s2401/e].

    (b)

        (1) The program performance report shall set forth the performance indicators established in the Postal Service performance plan, along with the actual program performance achieved compared with the performance goals expressed in the plan for that fiscal year.

        (2) If performance goals are specified by descriptive statements of a minimally effective program activity and a successful program activity, the results of such program shall be described in relationship to those categories, including whether the performance failed to meet the criteria of either category.

    (c) The report for fiscal year 2000 shall include actual results for the preceding fiscal year, the report for fiscal year 2001 shall include actual results for the two preceding fiscal years, and the report for fiscal year 2002 and all subsequent reports shall include actual results for the three preceding fiscal years.

    (d)

     Each report shall—

        (1) review the success of achieving the performance goals of the fiscal year;

        (2) evaluate the performance plan for the current fiscal year relative to the performance achieved towards the performance goals in the fiscal year covered by the report;

        (3)

         explain and describe, where a performance goal has not been met (including when a program activity’s performance is determined not to have met the criteria of a successful program activity under section 2803(b)(2))—

            (A) why the goal was not met;

            (B) those plans and schedules for achieving the established performance goal; and

            (C) if the performance goal is impractical or infeasible, why that is the case and what action is recommended; and

        (4) include the summary findings of those program evaluations completed during the fiscal year covered by the report.
