        (2) The percentage of such per-item cost avoided that the per-item workshare discount represents.

        (3) The per-item contribution made to institutional costs.

    (c) __Market Tests.—__ 

    In carrying out subsections (a) and (b) with respect to experimental products offered through market tests under section 3641 in a year, the Postal Service shall—

    (d) __Supporting Matter.—__ 

    The Postal Regulatory Commission shall have access, in accordance with such regulations as the Commission shall prescribe, to the working papers and any other supporting matter of the Postal Service and the Inspector General in connection with any information submitted under this section.

    (e) __Content and Form of Reports.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, by regulation, prescribe the content and form of the public reports (and any nonpublic annex and supporting matter relating to the report) to be provided by the Postal Service under this section. In carrying out this subsection, the Commission shall give due consideration to—

        The Commission may, on its own motion or on request of an interested party, initiate proceedings (to be conducted in accordance with regulations that the Commission shall prescribe) to improve the quality, accuracy, or completeness of Postal Service data required by the Commission under this subsection whenever it shall appear that—

            (A) the attribution of costs or revenues to products has become significantly inaccurate or can be significantly improved;

            (B) the quality of service data has become significantly inaccurate or can be significantly improved; or

            (C) such revisions are, in the judgment of the Commission, otherwise necessitated by the public interest.

    (f) __Confidential Information.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        If the Postal Service determines that any document or portion of a document, or other matter, which it provides to the Postal Regulatory Commission in a nonpublic annex under this section or under subsection (d) contains information which is described in [section 410(c) of this title][/us/usc/t39/s410/c], or exempt from public disclosure under [section 552(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b], the Postal Service shall, at the time of providing such matter to the Commission, notify the Commission of its determination, in writing, and describe with particularity the documents (or portions of documents) or other matter for which confidentiality is sought and the reasons therefor.

        (2) __Treatment.—__ 

        Any information or other matter described in paragraph (1) to which the Commission gains access under this section shall be subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 504(g) in the same way as if the Commission had received notification with respect to such matter under section 504(g)(1).

    (g) __Other Reports.—__ 

    The Postal Service shall submit to the Postal Regulatory Commission, together with any other submission that the Postal Service is required to make under this section in a year, copies of its then most recent—
