            (A) is a skill contest or sweepstakes, except for any matter described in section 3001(k)(4); and

            (B)

                (i) is addressed to an individual who made an election to be excluded from lists under subsection (d); or

                (ii) does not comply with subsection (c)(1).

    (c) __Requirements of Promoters.—__

        (2)  __Notification system__  __.—__ 

        Any promoter that mails or causes to be mailed a skill contest or sweepstakes shall establish and maintain a notification system that provides for any individual (or other duly authorized person) to notify the system of the individual’s election to have the name and address of the individual excluded from all lists of names and addresses used by that promoter to mail any skill contest or sweepstakes.

    (d) __Election To Be Excluded From Lists.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        An individual (or other duly authorized person) may elect to exclude the name and address of that individual from all lists of names and addresses used by a promoter of skill contests or sweepstakes by submitting a removal request to the notification system established under subsection (c).

        (2)  __Response after submitting removal request to the notification system__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 60 calendar days after a promoter receives a removal request pursuant to an election under paragraph (1), the promoter shall exclude the individual’s name and address from all lists of names and addresses used by that promoter to select recipients for any skill contest or sweepstakes.

        (3)  __Effectiveness of election__  __.—__ 

        An election under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect, unless an individual (or other duly authorized person) notifies the promoter in writing that such individual—

    (e) __Private Right of Action.—__

    (f)  __Promoter Nonliability__  __.—__ 

    A promoter shall not be subject to civil liability for the exclusion of an individual’s name or address from any list maintained by that promoter for mailing skill contests or sweepstakes, if—
