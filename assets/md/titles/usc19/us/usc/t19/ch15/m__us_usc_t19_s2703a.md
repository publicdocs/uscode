        (4) __Enter; entry__ 

            The terms “enter” and “entry” refer to the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, in the customs territory of the United States.

        (5) __Imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic__ 

        Articles are “imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic” if—

            (A) the articles are shipped directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic into the United States without passing through the territory of any intermediate country; or

            (B)

             the articles are shipped from Haiti or the Dominican Republic into the United States through the territory of an intermediate country, and—

                (i) the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any intermediate country, and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents specify the United States as the final destination; or

                (ii)

                 the invoices and other documents do not specify the United States as the final destination, but the articles in the shipment—

                    In the initial applicable 1-year period, the requirements under clause (i) relating to applicable percentage may also be met for articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that enter during the initial applicable 1-year period by aggregating—

                      of all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled, or are knit-to-shape, in Haiti and are entered during the initial applicable 1-year period.

            (II) __Other 1-year periods__ 

            In any 1-year period after the initial applicable 1-year period, the requirements under clause (i) relating to applicable percentage may also be met for articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that enter during the 1-year period by aggregating—

                (aa) the cost or value of materials under subclause (I) of clause (i), and

                (bb) the direct costs of processing operations under subclause (II) of clause (i),

              of all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled, or are knit-to-shape, in Haiti and are entered during the preceding 1-year period.

                (bb) any foreign materials that are used in the production of the materials described in subclause (I)(aa) or (II)(aa) (as the case may be).

            (IV) __Inclusion in calculation of other articles receiving preferential treatment__ 

                Entries of apparel articles that receive preferential treatment under any provision of law other than this subparagraph or are subject to the “General” column 1 rate of duty under the HTS are not included in the annual aggregation under subclause (I) or (II) unless the producer or entity controlling production elects, at the time the annual aggregation calculation is made, to include such entries in such aggregation.

            If U.S. Customs and Border Protection finds that a producer or an entity controlling production has not satisfied such requirements in the initial applicable 1-year period or any 1-year period thereafter, either for individual entries entered pursuant to clause (i) or for entries entered in aggregate pursuant to clause (iv), then apparel articles described in clause (i) of that producer or entity shall be ineligible for preferential treatment under paragraph (1) during any succeeding 1-year period until—

                (aa) the cost or value of materials under subclause (I) of clause (i), plus

                (bb) the direct costs of processing operations under subclause (II) of clause (i),

              of that producer or entity controlling production, is not less than the applicable percentage under clause (v)(I), plus 10 percent, of the aggregate declared customs value of all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled, or are knit-to-shape, in Haiti and are entered during the preceding 1-year period.

                (bb) that producer or entity controlling production satisfies the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause in that 1-year period,

              then, notwithstanding [section 1514 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1514] or any other provision of law, upon proper request filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection before the 90th day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines that item (bb) applies, the entry of any articles—

            (AA) that was made during that 1-year period, and

            (BB) with respect to which there would have been preferential treatment under subparagraph (A) if the producer or entity controlling production had satisfied the requirements in clause (i) or (iv) (as the case may be),

              shall be liquidated or reliquidated as though such preferential treatment under subparagraph (A) applied to such entry.

            (I) __In general__ 

            For purposes of determining the applicable percentage under clause (i) or (iv), there may be included in that percentage—

              without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarns.

            (II) __Removal of designation of fabrics or yarns not available in commercial quantities__

                (aa) any fabric or yarn described in subclause (I)(aa) was determined to be eligible for preferential treatment, or

                (bb) any fabric or yarn described in subclause (I)(bb) was designated as not being available in commercial quantities,

                    (III)

                     The Secretary of Commerce may require any textile mill or other entity located in the United States that exports to Haiti qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric to submit, upon such export or upon request, documentation, such as a Shipper’s Export Declaration, to the Secretary of Commerce—

                        (bb) procedures imposed on producers or entities controlling production to allow the Secretary of Commerce to obtain and verify information relating to the production of qualifying knit fabric.

                (iii) __Qualifying woven fabric defined__ 

                For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “qualifying woven fabric” means fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States, except that—

                (i) __Fraudulent claims of preference__ 

                    Any person who makes a false claim for preference under the program established under subparagraph (B) shall be subject to any applicable civil or criminal penalty that may be imposed under the customs laws of the United States or under title 18.

        (5) __Short supply provision__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Any apparel article that is wholly assembled, or knit-to-shape, in Haiti from any combination of fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns and is imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic shall enter the United States free of duty, without regard to the source of the fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns from which the article is made, if the fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns comprising the component that determines the tariff classification of the article are of any of the following:

                    (III) clause (i)(III) or (ii) of [section 3203(b)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3203/b/3/B]; or

                    (IV) any other provision, relating to determining whether a textile or apparel article is an originating good eligible for preferential treatment, of a law that implements a free trade agreement entered into by the United States that is in effect at the time the claim for preferential treatment is made.

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 111–171, § 2][/us/pl/111/171/s2], May 24, 2010, [124 Stat. 1194][/us/stat/124/1194], provided that: 

> “Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the worst earthquake to affect Haiti in recorded history. Aftershocks from the earthquake, measuring up to 6.0 on the Richter scale, continued for days afterwards.

>     “(2) The earthquake has devastated Haiti’s infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, ports, communications, and other facilities. The loss of life attributable to the earthquake was massive.

>     “(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 countries according to the United Nation’s Human Development Index.

>     “(4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic growth and development, including making strides towards establishing a competitive apparel sector.

>     “(5) United States trade preference programs, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act \[[19 U.S.C. 2701][/us/usc/t19/s2701] et seq.\] (as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act \[[Pub. L. 106–200, title II][/us/pl/106/200], see Tables for classification\], the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 \[[Pub. L. 109–432, div. D, title V][/us/pl/109/432], see Tables for classification\], and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 \[[Pub. L. 110–234, title XV][/us/pl/110/234], subtitle D, part I, and [Pub. L. 110–246, title XV][/us/pl/110/246], subtitle D, part I, see Tables for classification\]), which extend duty-free tariff treatment to certain apparel produced in Haiti, have made an important contribution to Haiti’s economic development efforts.

>     “(6) However, the Haitian apparel sector has been hard hit by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. A number of apparel factories based in and around Port-au-Prince have been heavily damaged, including the collapse of one major apparel factory that had employed nearly 4,000 workers.

>     “(7) The Port-au-Prince seaport that had served the apparel trade has been badly damaged. And extensive damage to roads has made it difficult to transport apparel to the Dominican Republic for shipment from ports in that country.

>     “(8) According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, imports of apparel articles from Haiti to the United States in 2010 have decreased by 43 percent as compared to the same period in 2009.

>     “(9) The earthquake has increased significantly the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Haiti. A strong and unequivocal commitment from the United States is needed to help Haiti offset these costs and preserve the gains made under United States trade preference programs, and to encourage buyers and investors to stand with Haiti through this crisis.”

>                 “(iv) otherwise strengthening cooperation between the customs authorities of the United States, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic with respect to trade facilitation and economic development, customs compliance and law enforcement, and efforts to combat unlawful trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

>         “(2)  __Report__  __.—__ 

>         Not later than 75 days after the date of the enactment of this Act \[May 24, 2010\], the Commissioner shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives a nonconfidential report summarizing the results of the assessment required by paragraph (1)(A), including—
