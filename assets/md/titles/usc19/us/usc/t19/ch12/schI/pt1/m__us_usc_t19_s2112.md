## § 2112. Barriers to and other distortions of trade

    (a) __Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation__ 

        The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. The President is further urged to utilize the authority granted by subsection (b) of this section to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutuality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legislation which may be necessary to implement an agreement concerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.

    (b) __Presidential determinations prerequisite to entry into trade agreements; trade with Israel__ 

        (1) Whenever the President determines that any barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affect the United States economy, or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President, during the 13-year period beginning on January 3, 1975, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers (or other distortions) or providing for the prohibition of or limitations on the imposition of such barriers (or other distortions).

        (2)

            (A) Trade agreements that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) only with Israel.

            (B) The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory preferential tariff arrangement between Israel and a third country if the tariff preference on such product has been the subject of a challenge by the United States Government under the authority of [section 2411 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2411] and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

            (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the requirements of subsections (c) and (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.

        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with such other country that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.

        (4)

            (A)

             Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any country other than Israel if—

                (i) such country requested the negotiation of such an agreement, and

                (ii)

                 the President, at least 60 days prior to the date notice is provided under subsection (e)(1) of this section—

                    (I) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and

                    (II) consults with such committees regarding the negotiation of such agreement.

            (B)

             The provisions of [section 2191 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2191] shall not apply to an implementing bill (within the meaning of [section 2191(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2191/b]) if—

                (i)

                 such implementing bill contains a provision approving of any trade agreement which—

                    (I) is entered into under this section with any country other than Israel, and

                    (II) provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States, and

                (ii)

                 either—

                    (I) the requirements of subparagraph (A) were not met with respect to the negotiation of such agreement, or

                    (II) the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives disapproved of the negotiation of such agreement before the close of the 60-day period which begins on the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) with respect to the negotiation of such agreement.

            (C)

             The 60-day period described in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(II) shall be computed without regard to—

                (i) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and

                (ii) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under clause (i), when either House of Congress is not in session.

    (c) __Presidential consultation with Congress prior to entry into trade agreements__ 

        Before the President enters into any trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and with each committee of the House and the Senate and each joint committee of the Congress which has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such trade agreement. Such consultation shall include all matters relating to the implementation of such trade agreement as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. If it is proposed to implement such trade agreement, together with one or more other trade agreements entered into under this section, in a single implementing bill, such consultation shall include the desirability and feasibility of such proposed implementation.

    (d) __Submission to Congress of agreements, drafts of implementing bills, and statements of proposed administrative action__ 

        Whenever the President enters into a trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall submit such agreement, together with a draft of an implementing bill (described in [section 2191(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2191/b]) and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, to the Congress as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and such agreement shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if the provisions of subsection (e) of this section are complied with and the implementing bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.

    (e) __Steps prerequisite to entry into force of trade agreements__ 

    Each trade agreement submitted to the Congress under this subsection shall enter into force with respect to the United States if (and only if)—

        (1) the President, not less than 90 days before the day on which he enters into such trade agreement, notifies the House of Representatives and the Senate of his intention to enter into such an agreement, and promptly thereafter publishes notice of such intention in the Federal Register;

        (2)

         after entering into the agreement, the President transmits a document to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing a copy of the final legal text of such agreement together with—

            (A) a draft of an implementing bill and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, and an explanation as to how the implementing bill and proposed administrative action change or affect existing law, and

            (B) a statement of his reasons as to how the agreement serves the interests of United States commerce and as to why the implementing bill and proposed administrative action is required or appropriate to carry out the agreement; and

        (3) the implementing bill is enacted into law.

    (f) __Obligations imposed upon foreign countries or instrumentalities receiving benefits under trade agreements__ 

        To insure that a foreign country or instrumentality which receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into under this section is subject to the obligations imposed by such agreement, the President may recommend to Congress in the implementing bill and statement of administrative action submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement apply solely to the parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement. The President may also recommend with respect to any such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement not apply uniformly to all parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement.

    “(A) they are wholly obtained or produced in the territory of either Party or both Parties; or

    “(B) they—

    “(i) have been transformed in the territory of either Party or both Parties so as to be subject to a change in tariff classification as described in the Annex rules or to such other requirements as the Annex rules may provide when no change in tariff classifications occurs, and

    “(ii) meet the other conditions set out in the Annex.

    “(2) A good shall not be considered to originate in the territory of a party \[Party\] under paragraph (1)(B) merely by virtue of having undergone—

    “(A) simple packaging or, except as expressly provided by the Annex rules, combining operations;

    “(B) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good; or

    “(C) any process or work in respect of which it is established, or in respect of which the facts as ascertained clearly justify the presumption, that the sole object was to circumvent the provisions of chapter 3 of the Agreement.

    “(3) Accessories, spare parts, or tools delivered with any piece of equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle that form part of its standard equipment shall be treated as having the same origin as that equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle if the quantities and values of such accessories, spare parts, or tools are customary for the equipment, machinery, apparatus, or vehicle.

    “(b) Transshipment.—Goods exported from the territory of one Party originate in the territory of that Party only if—

    “(1) the goods meet the applicable requirements of subsection (a) and are shipped to the territory of the other Party without having entered the commerce of any third country;

    “(c) Interpretation.—In interpreting this section, the following apply:

    “(1) Whenever the processing or assembly of goods in the territory of either Party or both Parties results in one of the changes in tariff classification described in the Annex rules, such goods shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of that Party and shall be treated as goods originating in the territory of that Party if—

    “(A) such processing or assembly occurs entirely within the territory of either Party or both Parties; and

    “(B) such goods have not subsequently undergone any processing or assembly outside the territories of the Parties that improves the goods in condition or advances them in value.

    “(2) Whenever the assembly of goods in the territory of a Party fails to result in a change of tariff classification because either—

    “(A) the goods were imported into the territory of the Party in an unassembled or a disassembled form and were classified as unassembled or disassembled goods pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the Harmonized System; or

    “(B) the tariff subheading for the goods provides for both the goods themselves and their parts;

    such goods shall not be treated as goods originating in the territory of a Party.

    “(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), goods described in that paragraph shall be considered to have been transformed in the territory of a Party and be treated as goods originating in the territory of the Party if—

    “(1) The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’) may recommend to the President the imposition of a temporary duty on any Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable entered into the United States if the Secretary determines that both of the following conditions exist at the time that imposition of the duty is recommended:

    “(A) For each of 5 consecutive working days the import price of the Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable is below 90 percent of the corresponding 5-year average monthly import price for such fruit or vegetable.

    “(B) The planted acreage in the United States for the like fresh fruit or vegetable is no higher than the average planted acreage over the preceding 5 years, excluding the years with the highest and lowest acreage. For the purposes of applying this subparagraph, any acreage increase attributed directly to a reduction in the acreage that was planted to wine grapes as of October 4, 1987, shall be excluded.

The receipt of such request by the United States Secretary shall be deemed to be a request for binational panel review within the meaning of article 1904(4) of the Agreement. Such request shall contain such information and be in such form, manner, and style as the administering authority shall prescribe by regulations. The request for such panel review shall not preclude the United States, Canada, or any other person from challenging before a binational panel the basis for a particular request for review.

    “(c) Service of Request for Review.—Whenever binational panel review is requested under this section, the United States Secretary shall serve a copy of the request on all persons who would otherwise be entitled under Canadian law to commence procedures for judicial review of a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination made by a competent investigating authority of Canada.

    “SEC. 409. SUBSIDIES.

    “(a) Negotiating Authority.—

    “(1) The President is authorized to enter into an agreement with Canada, including an agreement to amend the Agreement, on rules applicable to trade between the United States and Canada that—

    “(A) deal with unfair pricing and government subsidization, and

    “(B) provide for increased discipline on subsidies.

    “(2)(A) The objectives of the United States in negotiating an agreement under paragraph (1) include (but are not limited to)—

    “(i) achievement, on an expedited basis, of increased discipline on government production and export subsidies that have a significant impact, directly or indirectly, on bilateral trade between the United States and Canada; and

    “(ii) attainment of increased and more effective discipline on those Canadian Government (including provincial) subsidies having the most significant adverse impact on United States producers that compete with subsidized products of Canada in the markets of the United States and Canada.

    “(B) Special emphasis should be given in negotiating an agreement under paragraph (1) to obtain discipline on Canadian subsidy programs that adversely affect United States industries which directly compete with subsidized imports.

    “(3) The United States members of the working group established under article 1907 of the Agreement shall consult regularly with the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2155][/us/usc/t19/s2155]\] regarding—

    “(A) the issues being considered by the working group; and

    “(B) as appropriate, the objectives and strategy of the United States in the negotiations.

    “(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or of any other law, the provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2191][/us/usc/t19/s2191]) shall not apply to any bill or joint resolution that implements an agreement entered into under paragraph (1), unless the President determines and notifies the Congress that such agreement—

    “(A) will provide greater discipline over government subsidies and no less discipline over unfair pricing practices by producers than that provided by the agreements described in paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 2\[(c)\] of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 \[[19 U.S.C. 2503(c)(5)][/us/usc/t19/s2503/c/5], (6)\] (the Subsidies Code and Antidumping Code), respectively, taking into account the effects of the Agreement, and

    “(B) will neither undermine such multilateral discipline nor detract from United States efforts to increase such discipline on a multilateral basis in, or subsequent to, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.

    “(b) Identification of Industries Facing Subsidized Imports.—

    “(1) Any entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, that is representative of a United States industry and has reason to believe that—

    “(A)(i) as a result of implementation of provisions of the Agreement, the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized Canadian imports with which it directly competes; or

    “(ii) the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized imports with which it directly competes from any other country designated by the President, following consultations with the Congress, as benefitting from a reduction of tariffs or other trade barriers under a trade agreement that enters into force after January 1, 1989; and

    “(B) the industry is likely to experience a deterioration of its competitive position before rules and disciplines relating to the use of government subsidies have been developed with respect to such country;

    may file a petition with the United States Trade Representative (hereafter referred to in this section as the ‘Trade Representative’) to be identified under this section.

    “(2) Within 90 days of receipt of a petition under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall decide whether to identify the industry on the basis that there is a reasonable likelihood that the industry may face both the subsidization described in paragraph (1)(A) and the deterioration described in paragraph (1)(B).

    “(3) At the request of an entity that is representative of an industry identified under paragraph (2), the Trade Representative shall—

    “(A) compile and make available to the industry information under section 308 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2418][/us/usc/t19/s2418]\],

    “(B) recommend to the President that an investigation by the United States International Trade Commission be requested under section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1332][/us/usc/t19/s1332]\], or

    “(C) take actions described in both subparagraphs (A) and (B).

    The industry may request the Trade Representative to take appropriate action to update (as often as annually) any information obtained under subparagraph (A) or (B), or both, as the case may be, until an agreement on adequate rules and disciplines relating to government subsidies is reached.

    “(4)(A) The Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce shall review information obtained under paragraph (3) and consult with the industry identified under paragraph (2) with a view to deciding whether any action is appropriate under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2411][/us/usc/t19/s2411]\], including the initiation of an investigation under section 302(c) of that Act \[[19 U.S.C. 2412(c)][/us/usc/t19/s2412/c]\] (in the case of the Trade Representative), or under subtitle A of title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\], including the initiation of an investigation under section 702(a) of that Act \[[19 U.S.C. 1671a(a)][/us/usc/t19/s1671a/a]\] (in the case of the Secretary of Commerce).

    “(B) In determining whether to initiate any investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2411][/us/usc/t19/s2411]\] or any other trade law, other than title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\], the Trade Representative, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce—

    “(i) shall seek the advice of the advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2155][/us/usc/t19/s2155]\];

    “(ii) shall consult with the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives;

    “(iii) shall coordinate with the interagency committee established under section 242 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \[[19 U.S.C. 1872][/us/usc/t19/s1872]\]; and

    “(iv) may ask the President to request advice from the United States International Trade Commission.

    “(C) In the event an investigation is initiated under section 302(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2412(c)][/us/usc/t19/s2412/c]\] as a result of a review under this paragraph and the President, following such investigation (including any applicable dispute settlement proceedings under the Agreement or any other trade agreement), determines to take action under section 301(a) of such Act \[[19 U.S.C. 2411(a)][/us/usc/t19/s2411/a]\], the President shall give preference to actions that most directly affect the products that benefit from governmental subsidies and were the subject of the investigation, unless there are no significant imports of such products or the President otherwise determines that application of the action to other products would be more effective.

    “(5) Any decision, whether positive or negative, or any action by the Trade Representative or the Secretary of Commerce under this section shall not in any way—

    “(A) prejudice the right of any industry to file a petition under any trade law,

    “(B) prejudice, affect, or substitute for, any proceeding, investigation, determination, or action by the Secretary of Commerce, the United States International Trade Commission, or the Trade Representative pursuant to such a petition,

    “(C) prejudice, affect, substitute for, or obviate any proceeding, investigation, or determination under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2411][/us/usc/t19/s2411]\], title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\], or any other trade law.

    “(6) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to alter in any manner the requirements in effect before the enactment of this Act \[Sept. 28, 1988\] for standing under any law of the United States or to add any additional requirements for standing under any law of the United States.

 __Ex. Ord. No. 13141. Environmental Review of Trade Agreements__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 13141, Nov. 16, 1999, 64 F.R. 63169, provided:

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the environmental and trade policy goals of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1. Policy. The United States is committed to a policy of careful assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements. The United States will factor environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives. Responsible agencies will accomplish these goals through a process of ongoing assessment and evaluation, and, in certain instances, written environmental reviews.

    Sec. 2. Purpose and Need. Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development. Environmental reviews are an important tool to help identify potential environmental effects of trade agreements, both positive and negative, and to help facilitate consideration of appropriate responses to those effects whether in the course of negotiations, through other means, or both.

    Sec. 3. (a) Implementation. The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall oversee the implementation of this order, including the development of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation with appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and economic agencies.

    (b) Conduct of Environmental Reviews. The Trade Representative, through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), shall conduct the environmental reviews of the agreements under section 4 of this order.

    Sec. 4. Trade Agreements.

    (a) Certain agreements that the United States may negotiate shall require an environmental review. These include:

    (i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;

    (ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade agreements; and

    (iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in natural resource sectors.

    (b) Agreements reached in connection with enforcement and dispute resolution actions are not covered by this order.

    (c) For trade agreements not covered under subsections 4(a) and (b), environmental reviews will generally not be required. Most sectoral liberalization agreements will not require an environmental review. The Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall determine whether an environmental review of an agreement or category of agreements is warranted based on such factors as the significance of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.

    Sec. 5. Environmental Reviews.

    (a) Environmental reviews shall be:

    (i) written;

    (ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, outlining the proposed agreement and soliciting public comment and information on the scope of the environmental review of the agreement;

    (iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process to inform the development of negotiating positions, but shall not be a condition for the timely tabling of particular negotiating proposals;

    (iv) made available in draft form for public comment, where practicable; and

    (v) made available to the public in final form.

    (b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental reviews will be impacts in the United States. As appropriate and prudent, reviews may also examine global and transboundary impacts.

    Sec. 6. Resources. Upon request by the Trade Representative, with the concurrence of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide analytical and financial resources and support, including the detail of appropriate personnel, to the Office of the United States Trade Representative to carry out the provisions of this order.

    Sec. 7. General Provisions. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right, benefit, trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

                              William J. Clinton.
