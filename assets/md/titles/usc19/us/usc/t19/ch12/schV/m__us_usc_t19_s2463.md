            (B) __Other waiver limits__ 

                (i)

                 The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which exceeds 15 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year—

                    (I) having an appraised value in excess of 1.5 times the applicable amount set forth in subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) for that calendar year; or

                    (II) exceeding 75 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of that article into the United States during that calendar year.

                (i) entered duty-free under this subchapter during such calendar year; and

                (ii) is in excess of the value of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) applied.

        (5) __Effective period of waiver__ 

            Any waiver granted under this subsection shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.
