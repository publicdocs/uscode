## § 2291. Qualifying requirements for workers

    (a) __Trade readjustment allowance conditions__ 

    Payment of a trade readjustment allowance shall be made to an adversely affected worker covered by a certification under subpart A of this part who files an application for such allowance for any week of unemployment which begins on or after the date of such certification, if the following conditions are met:

        (1)

         Such worker’s total or partial separation before the worker’s application under this part occurred—

            (A) on or after the date, as specified in the certification under which the worker is covered, on which total or partial separation began or threatened to begin in the adversely affected employment,

            (B) before the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the determination under [section 2273 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2273] was made, and

            (C) before the termination date (if any) determined pursuant to [section 2273(d) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2273/d].

        (2)

         Such worker had, in the 52-week period ending with the week in which such total or partial separation occurred, at least 26 weeks of employment at wages of $30 or more a week in adversely affected employment with a single firm, or, if data with respect to weeks of employment with a firm are not available, equivalent amounts of employment computed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. For the purposes of this paragraph, any week in which such worker—

            (A) is on employer-authorized leave for purposes of vacation, sickness, injury, maternity, or inactive duty or active duty military service for training,

            (B) does not work because of a disability that is compensable under a workmen’s compensation law or plan of a State or the United States,

            (C) had his employment interrupted in order to serve as a full-time representative of a labor organization in such firm, or

            (D) is on call-up for purposes of active duty in a reserve status in the Armed Forces of the United States, provided such active duty is “Federal service” as defined in [section 8521(a)(1) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8521/a/1],

            shall be treated as a week of employment at wages of $30 or more, but not more than 7 weeks, in case of weeks described in subparagraph (A) or (C), or both (and not more than 26 weeks, in the case of weeks described in subparagraph (B) or (D)), may be treated as weeks of employment under this sentence.

        (3)

         Such worker—

            (A) was entitled to (or would be entitled to if the worker applied therefor) unemployment insurance for a week within the benefit period (i) in which such total or partial separation took place, or (ii) which began (or would have begun) by reason of the filing of a claim for unemployment insurance by such worker after such total or partial separation;

            (B) has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance, except additional compensation that is funded by a State and is not reimbursed from any Federal funds, to which the worker was entitled (or would be entitled if the worker applied therefor); and

            (C) does not have an unexpired waiting period applicable to the worker for any such unemployment insurance.

        (4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.

        (5)

         Such worker—

            (A)

                (i) is enrolled in a training program approved by the Secretary under [section 2296(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2296/a], and

                (ii)

                 the enrollment required under clause (i) occurs no later than the latest of—

                    (I) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs after the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after such total separation,

                    (II) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs before the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after the date of such certification,

                    (III) 45 days after the date specified in subclause (I) or (II), as the case may be, if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period,

                    (IV) in the case of a worker who fails to enroll by the date required by subclause (I), (II), or (III), as the case may be, due to the failure to provide the worker with timely information regarding the date specified in such subclause, the last day of a period determined by the Secretary, or

                    (V) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,

            (B) has, after the date on which the worker became totally separated, or partially separated, from the adversely affected employment, completed a training program approved by the Secretary under [section 2296(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2296/a], or

            (C) has received a written statement under subsection (c)(1) of this section after the date described in subparagraph (B).

    (b) __Withholding of trade readjustment allowance pending beginning or resumption of participation in training program; period of applicability__ 

    If—

        (1)

         the Secretary determines that—

            (A)

             the adversely affected worker—

                (i) has failed to begin participation in the training program the enrollment in which meets the requirement of subsection (a)(5) of this section, or

                (ii) has ceased to participate in such training program before completing such training program, and

            (B) there is no justifiable cause for such failure or cessation, or

        (2) the certification made with respect to such worker under subsection (c)(1) of this section is revoked under subsection (c)(2) of this section,

        no trade readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker under this division for the week in which such failure, cessation, or revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program approved under [section 2296(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2296/a].

    (c) __Waivers of training requirements__ 

        (1) __Issuance of waivers__ 

        The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) of this section if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:

            (A) __Health__ 

                The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.

            (B) __Enrollment unavailable__ 

                The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.

            (C) __Training not available__ 

                Training approved by the Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in [section 2302 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s2302], and employers), no training that is suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable cost, or no training funds are available.

        (2) __Duration of waivers__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), a waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.

            (B) __Revocation__ 

                The Secretary shall revoke a waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in writing of the revocation.

        (3) __Agreements under section 2311__ 

            (A) __Issuance by cooperating States__ 

                An agreement under [section 2311 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2311] shall authorize a cooperating State to issue waivers as described in paragraph (1).

            (B) __Review of waivers__ 

            An agreement under [section 2311 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2311] shall require a cooperating State to review each waiver issued by the State under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1)—

                (i) 3 months after the date on which the State issues the waiver; and

                (ii) on a monthly basis thereafter.

            (C) __Submission of statements__ 

                An agreement under [section 2311 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2311] shall include a requirement that the cooperating State submit to the Secretary the written statements provided under paragraph (1) and a statement of the reasons for the waiver.
