## § 2351. “Firm” defined

    For purposes of this part:

    (1) __Firm__ 

        The term “firm” includes an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (including a development corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy, and receiver under decree of any court. A firm, together with any predecessor or successor firm, or any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same persons, may be considered a single firm where necessary to prevent unjustifiable benefits.

    (2) __Service sector firm__ 

        The term “service sector firm” means a firm engaged in the business of supplying services.
