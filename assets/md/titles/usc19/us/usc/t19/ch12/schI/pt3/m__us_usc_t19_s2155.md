            To the maximum extent feasible, such information and advice on negotiating objectives shall be sought and considered before the commencement of negotiations.

        (2)

         The President shall consult with representative elements of the private sector and the non-Federal governmental sector on the overall current trade policy of the United States. The consultations shall include, but are not limited to, the following elements of such policy:

            (A) The principal multilateral and bilateral trade negotiating objectives and the progress being made toward their achievement.

            (B) The implementation, operation, and effectiveness of recently concluded multilateral and bilateral trade agreements and resolution of trade disputes.

            (C) The actions taken under the trade laws of the United States and the effectiveness of such actions in achieving trade policy objectives.

            (D) Important developments in other areas of trade for which there must be developed a proper policy response.

        (3) The President shall take the advice received through consultation under paragraph (2) into account in determining the importance which should be placed on each major objective and negotiating position that should be adopted in order to achieve the overall trade policy of the United States.

    (b) __Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations__ 

        (1) The President shall establish an Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations to provide overall policy advice on matters referred to in subsection (a). The committee shall be composed of not more than 45 individuals and shall include representatives of non-Federal governments, labor, industry, agriculture, small business, service industries, retailers, nongovernmental environmental and conservation organizations, and consumer interests. The committee shall be broadly representative of the key sectors and groups of the economy, particularly with respect to those sectors and groups which are affected by trade. Members of the committee shall be recommended by the United States Trade Representative and appointed by the President for a term of 4 years or until the committee is scheduled to expire. An individual may be reappointed to committee for any number of terms. Appointments to the Committee  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized. </sup></sup>  shall be made without regard to political affiliation.

Such committees shall, insofar as is practicable, be representative of all industry, labor, agricultural, service, investment, defense, and other interests, respectively, including small business interests, and shall be organized by the United States Trade Representative and the Secretaries of Commerce, Defense, Labor, Agriculture, the Treasury, or other executive departments, as appropriate. The members of such committees shall be appointed by the United States Trade Representative in consultation with such Secretaries.

            (B)

             take into account such factors as—

                (i) patterns of actual and potential competition between United States industry and agriculture and foreign enterprise in international trade,

                (ii) the character of the nontariff barriers and other distortions affecting such competition,

                (iii) the necessity for reasonable limits on the number of such advisory committees,

                (iv) the necessity that each committee be reasonably limited in size, and

                (v) in the case of each sectoral committee, that the product lines covered by each committee be reasonably related.

    (d) __Policy, technical, and other advice and information__ 

        Committees established under subsection (c) shall meet at the call of the United States Trade Representative and the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Defense, or other executive departments, as appropriate, to provide policy advice, technical advice and information, and advice on other factors relevant to the matters referred to in subsection (a).

        (2) The report of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations and each appropriate policy advisory committee shall include an advisory opinion as to whether and to what extent the agreement promotes the economic interests of the United States and achieves the applicable overall and principal negotiating objectives set forth in [section 4201 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s4201], as appropriate.

            (B) notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, any committee established under subsection (b) or (c) may, in the discretion of the President or the President’s designee, terminate not later than the expiration of the 4-year period beginning on the date of its establishment.

They may be designated as advisors to a negotiating delegation, and may be permitted to participate in international meetings to the extent the head of the United States delegation deems appropriate. However, they may not speak or negotiate for the United States.

    (l) __Advisory committees established by Department of Agriculture__ 

        The provisions of title XVIII of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 ([7 U.S.C. 2281][/us/usc/t7/s2281] et seq.) shall not apply to any advisory committee established under subsection (c).
