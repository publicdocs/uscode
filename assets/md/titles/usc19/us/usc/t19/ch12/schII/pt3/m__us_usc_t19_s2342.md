        A firm certified under [section 2341 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2341] as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance may, at any time within 2 years after the date of such certification, file an application with the Secretary for adjustment assistance under this part.

            (A) is reasonably calculated to materially contribute to the economic adjustment of the firm,

            (B) gives adequate consideration to the interests of the workers of such firm, and

            (C) demonstrates that the firm will make all reasonable efforts to use its own resources for economic development.

        (2) The Secretary shall make a determination as soon as possible after the date on which an application is filed under this section, but in no event later than 60 days after such date.

    (c) __Termination of certification of eligibility__ 

        Whenever the Secretary determines that any firm no longer requires assistance under this part, he shall terminate the certification of eligibility of such firm and promptly have notice of such termination published in the Federal Register. Such termination shall take effect on the termination date specified by the Secretary.
