            (A) After receiving a report under [section 2252(f) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/f] containing an affirmative finding regarding serious injury, or the threat thereof, to a domestic industry, the President shall take all appropriate and feasible action within his power which the President determines will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.

            (B) The action taken by the President under subparagraph (A) shall be to such extent, and for such duration, subject to subsection (e)(1), that the President determines to be appropriate and feasible under such subparagraph.

            (C) The interagency trade organization established under [section 1872(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1872/a] shall, with respect to each affirmative determination reported under [section 2252(f) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/f], make a recommendation to the President as to what action the President should take under subparagraph (A).

        (2)

         In determining what action to take under paragraph (1), the President shall take into account—

                (ii) engaged in worker retraining efforts;

            (C) the efforts being made, or to be implemented, by the domestic industry (including the efforts included in any adjustment plan or commitment submitted to the Commission under [section 2252(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/a]) to make a positive adjustment to import competition;

            (D) the probable effectiveness of the actions authorized under paragraph (3) to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition;

            (E) the short- and long-term economic and social costs of the actions authorized under paragraph (3) relative to their short- and long-term economic and social benefits and other considerations relative to the position of the domestic industry in the United States economy;

            (F)

             other factors related to the national economic interest of the United States, including, but not limited to—

                (i) the economic and social costs which would be incurred by taxpayers, communities, and workers if import relief were not provided under this part,

    (d) __Time for taking effect of certain relief__ 

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any action described in subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C), that is taken under subsection (a)(1) shall take effect within 15 days after the day on which the President proclaims the action, unless the President announces, on the date he decides to take such action, his intention to negotiate one or more agreements described in subsection (a)(3)(E) in which case the action under subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) shall be proclaimed and take effect within 90 days after the date of such decision.

        (2) If the contingency set forth in subsection (c) occurs, the President shall, within 30 days after the date of the enactment of the joint resolution referred to in such subsection, proclaim the action recommended by the Commission under [section 2252(e)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/e/1].

    (e) __Limitations on actions__ 

        (1)

            (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the duration of the period in which an action taken under this section may be in effect shall not exceed 4 years.

            (B)

                (i)

                 Subject to clause (ii), the President, after receiving an affirmative determination from the Commission under [section 2254(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2254/c] (or, if the Commission is equally divided in its determination, a determination which the President considers to be an affirmative determination of the Commission), may extend the effective period of any action under this section if the President determines that—

                    (I) the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury; and

                    (II) there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.

                (ii) The effective period of any action under this section, including any extensions thereof, may not, in the aggregate, exceed 8 years.

        (2) Action of a type described in subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) may be taken under subsection (a)(1), under [section 2252(d)(1)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/d/1/G], or under [section 2252(d)(2)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2252/d/2/D] only to the extent the cumulative impact of such action does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.

        (3) No action may be taken under this section which would increase a rate of duty to (or impose a rate) which is more than 50 percent ad valorem above the rate (if any) existing at the time the action is taken.

        (4) Any action taken under this section proclaiming a quantitative restriction shall permit the importation of a quantity or value of the article which is not less than the average quantity or value of such article entered into the United States in the most recent 3 years that are representative of imports of such article and for which data are available, unless the President finds that the importation of a different quantity or value is clearly justified in order to prevent or remedy the serious injury.

        (5) An action described in subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) that has an effective period of more than 1 year shall be phased down at regular intervals during the period in which the action is in effect.

                (ii) the designation of any article as an eligible article for purposes of subchapter V;

                shall be treated as an increase in duty.

            (B)

                (ii) the designation of the article as an eligible article for the purposes of subchapter V.

        (7)

            (A)

             If an article was the subject of an action under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of subsection (a)(3), no new action may be taken under any of those subparagraphs with respect to such article for—

                (i) a period beginning on the date on which the previous action terminates that is equal to the period in which the previous action was in effect, or

        (1) If the President takes action under this section other than the implemention  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “implementation”. </sup></sup>  of agreements of the type described in subsection (a)(3)(E), the President may, after such action takes effect, negotiate agreements of the type described in subsection (a)(3)(E), and may, after such agreements take effect, suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, any action previously taken.

        (2) If an agreement implemented under subsection (a)(3)(E) is not effective, the President may, consistent with the limitations contained in subsection (e), take additional action under subsection (a).

        (3) Regulations prescribed under this subsection shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with efficient and fair administration, insure against inequitable sharing of imports by a relatively small number of the larger importers.
