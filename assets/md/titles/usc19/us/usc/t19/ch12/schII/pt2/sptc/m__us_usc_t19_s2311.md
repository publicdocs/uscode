            The core indicators of performance described in this paragraph are—

                (i) the percentage of workers receiving benefits under this part who are employed during the first or second calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the workers cease receiving such benefits;

The State shall conduct such redetermination in a timely manner, utilizing the immigration status verification system described in [section 1320b–7(d) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–7/d].

        (2) __Procedures__
