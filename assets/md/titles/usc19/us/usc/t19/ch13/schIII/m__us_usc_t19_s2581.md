        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President may sell import licenses at public auction under such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate.

        (1) section 125, 203, 301, or 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2135][/us/usc/t19/s2135], 2253, 2411, or 2436),

        (2) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ([50 U.S.C. 1701–170][/us/usc/t50/s1701–170]6),

        (3) authority under the notes of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, but not including any quantitative restriction imposed under section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1934 ([7 U.S.C. 624][/us/usc/t7/s624]),

        (4) the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1–44) \[now [50 U.S.C. 4301][/us/usc/t50/s4301] et seq.\],

        (5) section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956 ([7 U.S.C. 1854][/us/usc/t7/s1854]) other than for meat or meat products, or

        (6) any Act enacted explicitly for the purpose of implementing an international agreement to which the United States is a party, including such agreements relating to commodities, but not including any agreement relating to cheese or dairy products.
