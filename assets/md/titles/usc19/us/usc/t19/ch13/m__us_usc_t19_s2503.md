## § 2503. Approval of trade agreements

    (a) __Approval of agreements and statements of administrative action__ 

        In accordance with the provisions of sections 2112 and 2191 of this title, the Congress approves the trade agreements described in subsection (c) of this section submitted to the Congress on June 19, 1979, and the statements of administrative action proposed to implement such trade agreements submitted to the Congress on that date.

    (b) __Acceptance of agreements by the President__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The President may accept for the United States the final legal instruments or texts embodying each of the trade agreements approved by the Congress under subsection (a) of this section. The President shall submit a copy of each final instrument or text to the Congress on the date such text or instrument is available, together with a notification of any changes in the instruments or texts, including their annexes, if any, as accepted and the texts of such agreements as submitted to the Congress under subsection (a) of this section. Such final legal instruments or texts shall be deemed to be the agreements submitted to and approved by the Congress under subsection (a) of this section if such changes are—

            (A) only rectifications of a formal character or minor technical or clerical changes which do not affect the substance or meaning of the texts as submitted to the Congress on June 19, 1979, or

            (B) changes in annexes to such agreements, and the President determines that the balance of United States rights and obligations under such agreements is maintained.

        (2) __Application of agreement between the United States and other countries__ 

        No agreement accepted by the President under paragraph (1) shall apply between the United States and any other country unless the President determines that such country—

            (A) has accepted the obligations of the agreement with respect to the United States, and

            (B) should not otherwise be denied the benefits of the agreement with respect to the United States because such country has not accorded adequate benefits, including substantially equal competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States to the extent required under section 2136(c)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, to the United States.

        (3) __Limitation on acceptance concerning major industrial countries__ 

        The President may not accept an agreement described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), or (11) of subsection (c) of this section, unless he determines that each major industrial country (as defined in section 2136(d) 1 of this title) is also accepting the agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the President may accept such an agreement, if he determines that only one major industrial country is not accepting that agreement and the acceptance of that agreement by that country is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement, and if—

            (A) that country is not a major factor in trade in the products covered by that agreement,

            (B) the President has authority to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country and has taken steps to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country, or

            (C) a significant portion of United States trade would benefit from the agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and the President determines and reports to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the agreement.

            For purposes of this paragraph, the acceptance of an agreement by the European Communities on behalf of its member countries shall also be treated as acceptance of that agreement by each member country, and acceptance of an agreement by all the member countries of the European Communities shall also be treated as acceptance of that agreement by the European Communities.

    (c) __Trade agreements to which this Act applies__ 

    The trade agreements to which subsection (a) of this section applies are the following:

        (1) The Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (relating to customs valuation).

        (3) The Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.

 __Determination Regarding Acceptance and Application of Certain International Trade Agreements__ 

    1. Pursuant to section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2112(b)][/us/usc/t19/s2112/b]), I, through my duly empowered representative, on April 12, 1979, entered into the international agreements negotiated in the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. These agreements were:

    (i) Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;

    (ii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;

     (iii) Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;

    (viii) International Dairy Arrangement; and

    (ix) Arrangement Regarding Bovine Meat.

    These agreements are collectively referred to herein as the “MTN agreements”.

    2. In accordance with sections 102 and 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2112][/us/usc/t19/s2112] and 2191), the MTN agreements were submitted to Congress for its approval. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([93 Stat. 147][/us/stat/93/147]) \[this section\] approves the MTN agreements and authorizes the President to accept each of the MTN agreements provided that the President determines that all, or all but one, of the major industrial countries (as defined in section 126(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2136(d)][/us/usc/t19/s2136/d]) is also accepting the agreement. If the President determines that only one major industrial country is not accepting an agreement, the President may nevertheless accept such an agreement if he determines that the acceptance of that agreement by that country is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement, and if:

    (A) that country is not a major factor in trade in the products covered by that agreement;

    (B) the President has authority to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country and has taken steps to deny the benefits of the agreement to that country; or

    (C) a significant portion of United States trade would benefit from the agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and the President determines and reports to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the agreement.

3. Section 2 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 \[this section\] also provides that no agreement accepted by the President shall apply between the United States and any other country unless the President determines that such country:

    (A) has accepted the obligations of the agreement with respect to the United States, and

    (B) should not otherwise be denied the benefits of the agreement with respect to the United States because such country has not accorded adequate benefits, including substantially equal competitive opportunities for the commerce of the United States to the extent required under section 126(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 ([19 U.S.C. 2136(c)][/us/usc/t19/s2136/c]), to the United States.

    4. Section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 ([93 Stat. 151][/us/stat/93/151]) \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671]\], provides that the President must determine that certain conditions must be met before a country can be considered a “country under the Agreement” and, therefore, entitled to the injury determination provided for in section 703(a) and 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 ([93 Stat. 152][/us/stat/93/152] and 159) \[[19 U.S.C. 1671b(a)][/us/usc/t19/s1671b/a] and 1671d(b)\].

    5. Section 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([93 Stat. 267][/us/stat/93/267]) authorizes the President to proclaim certain modifications in the Tariff Schedules of the United States if the President determines that the conditions under section 2(b) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([93 Stat. 147][/us/stat/93/147]) \[subsec. (b) of this section\] on acceptance of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft have been fulfilled.

    NOW, THEREFORE, I, JIMMY CARTER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of sections 2 \[this section\] and 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([93 Stat. 147][/us/stat/93/147] and 267), herein referred to as “the Act”, section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended effective January 1, 1980 ([93 Stat. 151][/us/stat/93/151]) \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671]\], and [section 301 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301] of the United States Code do hereby

    (ii) in accordance with section 2(b)(3) of the Act ([93 Stat. 147][/us/stat/93/147]) \[subsec. (b)(3) of this section\], the acceptance of this agreement by Canada is not essential to the effective operation of the agreement; and
