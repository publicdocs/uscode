## § 3538. Administrative action following WTO panel reports

    (a) __Action by United States International Trade Commission__ 

        (1) __Advisory report__ 

            If a dispute settlement panel finds in an interim report under Article 15 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, or the Appellate Body finds in a report under Article 17 of that Understanding, that an action by the International Trade Commission in connection with a particular proceeding is not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the Antidumping Agreement, the Safeguards Agreement, or the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the Trade Representative may request the Commission to issue an advisory report on whether title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\] or title II of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2251][/us/usc/t19/s2251] et seq.\], as the case may be, permits the Commission to take steps in connection with the particular proceeding that would render its action not inconsistent with the findings of the panel or the Appellate Body concerning those obligations. The Trade Representative shall notify the congressional committees of such request.

        (2) __Time limits for report__ 

        The Commission shall transmit its report under paragraph (1) to the Trade Representative—

            (A) in the case of an interim report described in paragraph (1), within 30 calendar days after the Trade Representative requests the report; and

            (B) in the case of a report of the Appellate Body, within 21 calendar days after the Trade Representative requests the report.

        (3) __Consultations on request for Commission determination__ 

            If a majority of the Commissioners issues an affirmative report under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall consult with the congressional committees concerning the matter.

        (4) __Commission determination__ 

            Notwithstanding any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1202][/us/usc/t19/s1202] et seq.\] or title II of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2251][/us/usc/t19/s2251] et seq.\], if a majority of the Commissioners issues an affirmative report under paragraph (1), the Commission, upon the written request of the Trade Representative, shall issue a determination in connection with the particular proceeding that would render the Commission’s action described in paragraph (1) not inconsistent with the findings of the panel or Appellate Body. The Commission shall issue its determination not later than 120 days after the request from the Trade Representative is made.

        (5) __Consultations on implementation of Commission determination__ 

            The Trade Representative shall consult with the congressional committees before the Commission’s determination under paragraph (4) is implemented.

        (6) __Revocation of order__ 

            If, by virtue of the Commission’s determination under paragraph (4), an antidumping or countervailing duty order with respect to some or all of the imports that are subject to the action of the Commission described in paragraph (1) is no longer supported by an affirmative Commission determination under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\] or this subsection, the Trade Representative may, after consulting with the congressional committees under paragraph (5), direct the administering authority to revoke the antidumping or countervailing duty order in whole or in part.

    (b) __Action by administering authority__ 

        (1) __Consultations with administering authority and congressional committees__ 

            Promptly after a report by a dispute settlement panel or the Appellate Body is issued that contains findings that an action by the administering authority in a proceeding under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\] is not in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the Antidumping Agreement or the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the Trade Representative shall consult with the administering authority and the congressional committees on the matter.

        (2) __Determination by administering authority__ 

            Notwithstanding any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1202][/us/usc/t19/s1202] et seq.\], the administering authority shall, within 180 days after receipt of a written request from the Trade Representative, issue a determination in connection with the particular proceeding that would render the administering authority’s action described in paragraph (1) not inconsistent with the findings of the panel or the Appellate Body.

        (3) __Consultations before implementation__ 

            Before the administering authority implements any determination under paragraph (2), the Trade Representative shall consult with the administering authority and the congressional committees with respect to such determination.

        (4) __Implementation of determination__ 

            The Trade Representative may, after consulting with the administering authority and the congressional committees under paragraph (3), direct the administering authority to implement, in whole or in part, the determination made under paragraph (2).

    (c) __Effects of determinations; notice of implementation__ 

        (1) __Effects of determinations__ 

        Determinations concerning title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\] that are implemented under this section shall apply with respect to unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise (as defined in section 771 of that Act \[[19 U.S.C. 1677][/us/usc/t19/s1677]\]) that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after—

            (A) in the case of a determination by the Commission under subsection (a)(4) of this section, the date on which the Trade Representative directs the administering authority under subsection (a)(6) of this section to revoke an order pursuant to that determination, and

            (B) in the case of a determination by the administering authority under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the date on which the Trade Representative directs the administering authority under subsection (b)(4) of this section to implement that determination.

        (2) __Notice of implementation__ 

            (A) The administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the implementation of any determination made under this section with respect to title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[[19 U.S.C. 1671][/us/usc/t19/s1671] et seq.\].

            (B) The Trade Representative shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the implementation of any determination made under this section with respect to title II of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2251][/us/usc/t19/s2251] et seq.\].

    (d) __Opportunity for comment by interested parties__
