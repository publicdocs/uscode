        (A) to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements that create obligations to protect and enforce intellectual property rights that cover new and emerging technologies and new methods of transmission and distribution, and

        (B) to prevent or eliminate discrimination with respect to matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, use, and enforcement of intellectual property rights,

    (3) to secure fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory market access opportunities for United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection,

    (4) to take an active role in the development of the intellectual property regime under the World Trade Organization to ensure that it is consistent with other United States objectives, and
