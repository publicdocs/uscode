## § 3532. Implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements

    (a) __Decisionmaking__ 

        In the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements and the functioning of the World Trade Organization, it is the objective of the United States to ensure that the Ministerial Conference and the General Council continue the practice of decisionmaking by consensus followed under the GATT 1947, as required by paragraph 1 of article IX of the WTO Agreement.

    (b) __Consultations with congressional committees__ 

    In furtherance of the objective set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees before any vote is taken by the Ministerial Conference or the General Council relating to—

        (1) the adoption of an interpretation of the WTO Agreement or another multilateral trade agreement,

        (2) the amendment of any such agreement,

        (3) the granting of a waiver of any obligation under any such agreement,

        (4) the adoption of any amendment to the rules or procedures of the Ministerial Conference or the General Council,

        (5) the accession of a state or separate customs territory to the WTO Agreement, or

        (6) the adoption of any other decision,

        if the action described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) would substantially affect the rights or obligations of the United States under the WTO Agreement or another multilateral trade agreement or potentially entails a change in Federal or State law.

    (c) __Report on decisions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 30 days after the end of any calendar year in which the Ministerial Conference or the General Council adopts by vote any decision to take any action described in paragraph (1), (2), (4), or (6) of subsection (b) of this section, the Trade Representative shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees describing—

            (A) the nature of the decision;

            (B) the efforts made by the United States to have the matter decided by consensus pursuant to paragraph 1 of article IX of the WTO Agreement, and the results of those efforts;

            (C) which countries voted for, and which countries voted against, the decision;

            (D) the rights or obligations of the United States affected by the decision and any Federal or State law that would be amended or repealed, if the President after consultation with the Congress determined that such amendment or repeal was an appropriate response; and

            (E) the action the President intends to take in response to the decision or, if the President does not intend to take any action, the reasons therefor.

        (2) __Additional reporting requirements__ 

            (A) __Grant of waiver__ 

                In the case of a decision to grant a waiver described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, the report under paragraph (1) shall describe the terms and conditions of the waiver and the rights and obligations of the United States that are affected by the waiver.

            (B) __Accession__ 

                In the case of a decision on accession described in subsection (b)(5) of this section, the report under paragraph (1) shall state whether the United States intends to invoke Article XIII of the WTO Agreement.

    (d) __Consultation on report__ 

        Promptly after the submission of a report under subsection (c) of this section, the Trade Representative shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the report.
