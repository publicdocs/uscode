            Not later than 60 days after the Secretary of the Treasury first assesses an additional duty in a calendar year on a good under subsection (b), the Secretary shall notify the country whose good is subject to the additional duty in writing of such action and shall provide to that country data supporting the assessment of the additional duty.
