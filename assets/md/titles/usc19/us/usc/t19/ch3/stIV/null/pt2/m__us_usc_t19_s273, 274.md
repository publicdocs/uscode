    Sections, R.S. §§ 2885, 2886, required the containers of imported liquors or distilled spirits to be marked or scored at the port of landing with the capacity, wine gallons, proof, proof gallons, and other detailed information, such marks to be obliterated upon sale.

 __Effective Date of Repeal__ 

    [Act Aug. 8, 1953, ch. 397, § 1][/us/act/1953-08-08/ch397/s1], [67 Stat. 507][/us/stat/67/507], provided that such act is effective, except as otherwise specifically provided for, on and after the thirtieth day following the date of its enactment (Aug. 8, 1953).

    The exception “except as otherwise specifically provided for” apparently refers to the amendments made to the provisions preceding subd.

> “Except as may be otherwise provided for in this Act, the repeal of existing law or modifications thereof embraced in this Act shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing or accrued, or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil or criminal case prior to such repeal or modification, but all liabilities under such laws shall continue, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, and may be enforced in the same manner as if such repeal, or modification had not been made.”
