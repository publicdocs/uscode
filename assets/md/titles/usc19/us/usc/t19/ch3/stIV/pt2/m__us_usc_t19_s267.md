            (B) __11 p.m. to 8 a.m. shiftwork__ 

                If the majority of the hours of regularly scheduled work of a customs officer occurs during the period beginning at 11 p.m. and ending at 8 a.m., the officer is entitled to pay for work during such period (except for work to which paragraph (2) or (3) applies) at the officer’s hourly rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 20 percent of that basic rate.

            (C) __7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. shiftwork__

            A customs officer who performs any regularly scheduled work on a Sunday that is not a holiday is entitled to pay for that work at the officer’s hourly rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 50 percent of that basic rate.

        (3) __Holiday differential__ 

            A customs officer who performs any regularly scheduled work on a holiday is entitled to pay for that work at the officer’s hourly rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 100 percent of that basic rate.

        (4) __Treatment of premium pay__ 

            Premium pay provided for under this subsection may not be treated as being overtime pay or compensation for any purpose.

    (c) __Limitations__
