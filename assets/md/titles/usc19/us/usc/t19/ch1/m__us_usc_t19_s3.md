## § 3. Superintendence of collection of import duties

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the superintendence of the collection of the duties on imports as he shall judge best.

(R.S. § 249.)

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 249 derived from [act May 8, 1792, ch. 37][/us/act/1792-05-08/ch37], § 6, [1 Stat. 280][/us/stat/1/280].

    Section, prior to its incorporation into the Code, contained the words “and tonnage,” after “duties on imports”. These words were omitted as superseded by section 3 of the former Appendix to Title 46, Shipping, which charged the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection with the execution of the laws relating to the collection of the tonnage tax. Section 3 of the former Appendix to Title 46 was repealed by [Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], § 19, Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1710][/us/stat/120/1710].

>         “(A) may not, after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Dec. 22, 1987\], establish any new centralized cargo examination station at any ocean port, airport, or land border location unless the Customs Service provides to the Committees advance notice, in writing, of not less than 90 days regarding the proposed establishment; and

>         “(B)

>          shall, on such date of enactment, suspend operations at each centralized cargo examination station that was operating at an airport on the day before such date until the 90th day after a date—
