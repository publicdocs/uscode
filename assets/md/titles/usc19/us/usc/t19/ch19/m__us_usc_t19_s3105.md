        (1) If the President is unable, before the close of the negotiating period, to enter into an agreement under subtitle A with any priority foreign country identified under [section 3103 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3103] which achieves the general negotiating objectives described in [section 3104(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3104/b] as defined by the specific objectives established by the President for that country, the President shall take whatever actions authorized under subsection (b) that are appropriate and most likely to achieve such general negotiating objectives.

        (2) In taking actions under paragraph (1), the President shall first take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the priority foreign country referred to in paragraph (1), unless the President determines that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving the general negotiating objectives referred to in paragraph (1).

        (2) Notwithstanding section 125 of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2135][/us/usc/t19/s2135]\] and any other provision of law, if any portion of a trade agreement described in paragraph (1)(A) is terminated, withdrawn, or suspended under paragraph (1) with respect to any duty imposed by the United States on the products of a foreign country, the rate of such duty that shall apply to such products entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after the date on which such termination, withdrawal, or suspension takes effect shall be a rate determined by the President.
