            (A) revoke the identification of any priority foreign country that was made under this section, or

            (B) identify any foreign country as a priority foreign country under this section,

            if information available to the Trade Representative indicates that such action is appropriate.

        (2) The Trade Representative shall include in the semiannual report submitted to the Congress under [section 2419(3) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s2419/3] a detailed explanation of the reasons for the revocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection of any identification of any foreign country as a priority foreign country.

    (d) __Report to Congress__ 

        By no later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which the investigation conducted under subsection (a) is completed, the United States Trade Representative shall submit a report on the investigation to the President and to appropriate committees of the Congress.
