        The Secretary shall seek to include in each such bilateral agreement the following provisions and authorities:

            (A) On the request of the importing country, the exporting country shall provide, consistent with its laws, regulations, and procedures, production, trade, and transit documents and other information necessary to determine whether an entry or entries exported from the exporting country are subject to the importing country’s trade remedy laws.

    (b) __Consideration__ 

        The Commissioner is authorized to take into consideration whether a country is a signatory to a bilateral agreement described in subsection (a) and the extent to which the country is cooperating under the bilateral agreement for purposes of trade enforcement and compliance assessment activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection that concern evasion by such country’s exports.
