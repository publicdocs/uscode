## § 4452. United States-Israel trade and commercial enhancement

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress finds the following:

        (1) Israel is America’s dependable, democratic ally in the Middle East—an area of paramount strategic importance to the United States.

        (2) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement formed the modern foundation of the bilateral commercial relationship between the two countries and was the first such agreement signed by the United States with a foreign country.

        (3) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement has been instrumental in expanding commerce and the strategic relationship between the United States and Israel.

        (4) More than $45,000,000,000 in goods and services is traded annually between the two countries, in addition to roughly $10,000,000,000 in United States foreign direct investment in Israel.

        (5) The United States continues to look for and find new opportunities to enhance cooperation with Israel, including through the enactment of the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 ([Public Law 112–150][/us/pl/112/150]; [22 U.S.C. 8601][/us/usc/t22/s8601] et seq.) and the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 ([Public Law 113–296][/us/pl/113/296]; [128 Stat. 4075][/us/stat/128/4075]).

        (6)

         It has been the policy of the United States Government to combat all elements of the Arab League Boycott of Israel by—

            (A) public statements of Administration officials;

            (B) enactment of relevant sections of the Export Administration Act of 1979 ([50 U.S.C. 4601][/us/usc/t50/s4601] et seq.) (as continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ([50 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t50/s1701] et seq.)), including sections to ensure foreign persons comply with applicable reporting requirements relating to the Boycott;

            (C) enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 ([Public Law 94–455][/us/pl/94/455]; [90 Stat. 1520][/us/stat/90/1520]) that denies certain tax benefits to entities abiding by the Boycott;

            (D) ensuring through free trade agreements with Bahrain and Oman that such countries no longer participate in the Boycott; and

            (E) ensuring as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization that Saudi Arabia no longer enforces the secondary or tertiary elements of the Boycott.

    (b) __Statements of policy__ 

    Congress—

        (1) supports the strengthening of economic cooperation between the United States and Israel and recognizes the tremendous strategic, economic, and technological value of cooperation with Israel;

        (2) recognizes the benefit of cooperation with Israel to United States companies, including by improving American competitiveness in global markets;

        (3) recognizes the importance of trade and commercial relations to the pursuit and sustainability of peace, and supports efforts to bring together the United States, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and others in enhanced commerce;

        (4) opposes politically motivated actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, such as boycotts of, divestment from, or sanctions against Israel;

        (5) notes that boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-governmental bodies, international organizations, and other such entities are contrary to principle of nondiscrimination under the GATT 1994 (as defined in [section 3501(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3501/1/B]);

        (6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel such as boycotts of, divestment from, or sanctions against Israel as a topic of discussion at the U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) to support the strengthening of the United States-Israel commercial relationship and combat any commercial discrimination against Israel; and

        (7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or prosecutions by governments or international organizations of United States persons solely on the basis of such persons doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in any territory controlled by Israel.

    (c) __Principal trade negotiating objectives of the United States__ 

        (1) __Commercial partnerships__ 

        Among the principal trade negotiating objectives of the United States for proposed trade agreements with foreign countries regarding commercial partnerships are the following:

            (A) To discourage actions by potential trading partners that directly or indirectly prejudice or otherwise discourage commercial activity solely between the United States and Israel.

            (B) To discourage politically motivated boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel and to seek the elimination of politically motivated nontariff barriers on Israeli goods, services, or other commerce imposed on Israel.

            (C) To seek the elimination of state-sponsored unsanctioned foreign boycotts of Israel, or compliance with the Arab League Boycott of Israel, by prospective trading partners.

        (2) __Effective date__ 

            This subsection takes effect on February 24, 2016, and applies with respect to negotiations commenced before, on, or after such date.

        (1) __In general__

            (B) A description of specific steps being taken by the United States to encourage foreign countries and international organizations to cease creating such barriers and to dismantle measures already in place, and an assessment of the effectiveness of such steps.

            (C) A description of specific steps being taken by the United States to prevent investigations or prosecutions by governments or international organizations of United States persons solely on the basis of such persons doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-controlled territories.

            (D) Decisions by foreign persons, including corporate entities and state-affiliated financial institutions, that limit or prohibit economic relations with Israel or persons doing business in Israel or in any territory controlled by Israel.

    (e) __Certain foreign judgments against United States persons__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no domestic court shall recognize or enforce any foreign judgment entered against a United States person that conducts business operations in Israel, or any territory controlled by Israel, if the domestic court determines that the foreign judgment is based, in whole or in part, on a determination by a foreign court that the United States person’s conducting business operations in Israel or any territory controlled by Israel or with Israeli entities constitutes a violation of law.
