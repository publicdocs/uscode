## § 3203. Eligible articles

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1)

         Unless otherwise excluded from eligibility (or otherwise provided for) by this chapter, the duty-free treatment (or preferential treatment) provided under this chapter shall apply to any article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country if—

            (A) that article is imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States; and

            (B)

             the sum of—

                (i) the cost or value of the materials produced in a beneficiary country or 2 or more beneficiary countries under this chapter, or a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act \[[19 U.S.C. 2701][/us/usc/t19/s2701] et seq.\] or 2 or more such countries, plus

                (ii) the direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries (under this chapter or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act),

                is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered.

            For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B), the term “beneficiary country” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. If the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is included with respect to an article to which this paragraph applies, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered that is attributed to such United States cost or value may be applied toward determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B).

        (2)

         The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out paragraph (1) including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under this chapter, an article must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country, or must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary country; but no article or material of a beneficiary country shall be eligible for such treatment by virtue of having merely undergone—

            (A) simple combining or packaging operations, or

            (B) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.

        (3)

         As used in this subsection, the phrase “direct costs of processing operations” includes, but is not limited to—

            (A) all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and

            (B) dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise.

            Such phrase does not include costs which are not directly attributable to the merchandise concerned or are not costs of manufacturing the product, such as (i) profit, and (ii) general expense of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, interest, and salesmen’s salaries, commissions or expenses.

        (4) If the President, pursuant to section 223 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990, considers that the implementation of revised rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries designated under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act ([19 U.S.C. 2701][/us/usc/t19/s2701] et seq.) would be appropriate, the President may include similarly revised rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries designated under this chapter in any suggested legislation transmitted to the Congress that contains such rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.

    (b) __Exceptions and special rules__ 

        (1) __Certain articles that are not import-sensitive__ 

        The President may proclaim duty-free treatment under this chapter for any article described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) that is the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country, that is imported directly into the customs territory of the United States from an ATPDEA beneficiary country, and that meets the requirements of this section, if the President determines that such article is not import-sensitive in the context of imports from ATPDEA beneficiary countries:

            (A) Footwear not designated at the time of the effective date of this chapter as eligible for purposes of the generalized system of preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974 \[[19 U.S.C. 2461][/us/usc/t19/s2461] et seq.\].

            (B) Petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum, provided for in headings 2709 and 2710 of the HTS.

            (C) Watches and watch parts (including cases, bracelets and straps), of whatever type including, but not limited to, mechanical, quartz digital or quartz analog, if such watches or watch parts contain any material which is the product of any country with respect to which HTS column 2 rates of duty apply.

                (ii) __Penalties for countries__ 

                    Whenever the President finds, based on sufficient evidence, that transshipment has occurred, the President shall request that the ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries through whose territory the transshipment has occurred take all necessary and appropriate actions to prevent such transshipment.
