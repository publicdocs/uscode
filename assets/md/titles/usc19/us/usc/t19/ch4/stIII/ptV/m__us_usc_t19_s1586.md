    Provisions substantially the same in effect as those contained in the act of 1922, § 587, except that the penalty was treble the value of the merchandise, and the provision for forfeiture applied only to the vessel was contained in R.S. § 2868, prior to repeal by [act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch356], title IV, § 642, [42 Stat. 989][/us/stat/42/989].
