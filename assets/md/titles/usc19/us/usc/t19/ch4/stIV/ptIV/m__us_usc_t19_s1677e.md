## § 1677e. Determinations on basis of facts available

    (a) __In general__ 

    If—

        (1) necessary information is not available on the record, or

        (2)

         an interested party or any other person—

            (A) withholds information that has been requested by the administering authority or the Commission under this subtitle,

            (B) fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information or in the form and manner requested, subject to subsections (c)(1) and (e) of [section 1677m of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677m],

            (C) significantly impedes a proceeding under this subtitle, or

            (D) provides such information but the information cannot be verified as provided in [section 1677m(i) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677m/i],

        the administering authority and the Commission shall, subject to [section 1677m(d) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677m/d], use the facts otherwise available in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle.

    (b) __Adverse inferences__ 

    If the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the Commission, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be), in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle, may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available. Such adverse inference may include reliance on information derived from—

        (1) the petition,

        (2) a final determination in the investigation under this subtitle,

        (3) any previous review under [section 1675 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675] or determination under [section 1675b of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675b], or

        (4) any other information placed on the record.

    (c) __Corroboration of secondary information__ 

        When the administering authority or the Commission relies on secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of an investigation or review, the administering authority or the Commission, as the case may be, shall, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at their disposal.
