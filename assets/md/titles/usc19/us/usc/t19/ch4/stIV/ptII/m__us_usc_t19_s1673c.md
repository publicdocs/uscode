## § 1673c. Termination or suspension of investigation

    (a) __Termination of investigation upon withdrawal of petition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Withdrawal of petition__ 

                Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), an investigation under this part may be terminated by either the administering authority or the Commission, after notice to all parties to the investigation, upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner or by the administering authority if the investigation was initiated under [section 1673a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673a/a].

            (B) __Refiling of petition__ 

                If, within 3 months after the withdrawal of a petition under subparagraph (A), a new petition is filed seeking the imposition of duties on both the subject merchandise of the withdrawn petition and the subject merchandise from another country, the administering authority and the Commission may use in the investigation initiated pursuant to the new petition any records compiled in an investigation conducted pursuant to the withdrawn petition. This subparagraph applies only with respect to the first withdrawal of a petition.

        (2) __Special rules for quantitative restriction agreements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by accepting an understanding or other kind of agreement to limit the volume of imports into the United States of the subject merchandise unless the administering authority is satisfied that termination on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.

            (B) __Public interest factors__ 

            In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest the administering authority shall take into account—

                (i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of antidumping duties;

                (ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and

                (iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.

            (C) __Prior consultations__ 

            Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—

                (i) potentially affected consuming industries; and

                (ii) potentially affected producers and workers in the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including producers and workers not party to the investigation.

        (3) __Limitation on termination by Commission__ 

            The Commission may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) before a preliminary determination is made by the administering authority under [section 1673b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/b].

    (b) __Agreements to eliminate completely sales at less than fair value or to cease exports of merchandise__ 

    The administering authority may suspend an investigation if the exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise agree—

        (1) to cease exports of the merchandise to the United States within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended, or

        (2) to revise their prices to eliminate completely any amount by which the normal value of the merchandise which is the subject of the agreement exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of that merchandise.

    (c) __Agreements eliminating injurious effect__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement to revise prices from exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise into the United States, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of that merchandise and if—

            (A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and

            (B) for each entry of each exporter the amount by which the estimated normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) will not exceed 15 percent of the weighted average amount by which the estimated normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) for all less-than-fair-value entries of the exporter examined during the course of the investigation.

        (2) __“Extraordinary circumstances” defined__ 

            (A) __Extraordinary circumstances__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “extraordinary circumstances” means circumstances in which—

                (i) suspension of an investigation will be more beneficial to the domestic industry than continuation of the investigation, and

                (ii) the investigation is complex.

            (B) __“Complex” defined__

                (i) there are a large number of transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,

                (iii) the number of firms involved is large.

    (d) __Additional rules and conditions__ 

    The administering authority may not accept an agreement under subsection (b) or (c) unless—

        (1) it is satisfied that suspension of the investigation is in the public interest, and

        (2) effective monitoring of the agreement by the United States is practicable.

        Where practicable, the administering authority shall provide to the exporters who would have been subject to the agreement the reasons for not accepting the agreement and, to the extent possible, an opportunity to submit comments thereon.

    (e) __Suspension of investigation procedure__ 

    Before an investigation may be suspended under subsection (b) or (c) the administering authority shall—

        (1) notify the petitioner of, and consult with the petitioner concerning, its intention to suspend the investigation, and notify other parties to the investigation and the Commission not less than 30 days before the date on which it suspends the investigation,

        (2) provide a copy of the proposed agreement to the petitioner at the time of the notification, together with an explanation of how the agreement will be carried out and enforced, and of how the agreement will meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d) or (c) and (d), and

        (3) permit all interested parties described in [section 1677(9) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/9] to submit comments and information for the record before the date on which notice of suspension of the investigation is published under subsection (f)(1)(A).

    (f) __Effects of suspension of investigation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If the administering authority determines to suspend an investigation upon acceptance of an agreement described in subsection (b) or (c), then—

            (B) the Commission shall suspend any investigation it is conducting with respect to that merchandise, and

            (C) the suspension of investigation shall take effect on the day on which such notice is published.

        (2) __Liquidation of entries__ 

            (A) __Cessation of exports; complete elimination of dumping margin__ 

            If the agreement accepted by the administering authority is an agreement described in subsection (b), then—

                (i) notwithstanding the affirmative preliminary determination required under paragraph (1)(A), the liquidation of entries of subject merchandise shall not be suspended under [section 1673b(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/d/2],

                (ii) if the liquidation of entries of such merchandise was suspended pursuant to a previous affirmative preliminary determination in the same case with respect to such merchandise, that suspension of liquidation shall terminate, and

                (iii) the administering authority shall refund any cash deposit and release any bond or other security deposited under [section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/d/1/B].

        (3) __Where investigation is continued__ 

        If, pursuant to subsection (g), the administering authority and the Commission continue an investigation in which an agreement has been accepted under subsection (b) or (c), then—

            (A) if the final determination by the administering authority or the Commission under [section 1673d of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d] is negative, the agreement shall have no force or effect and the investigation shall be terminated, or

            (B)

             if the final determinations by the administering authority and the Commission under such section are affirmative, the agreement shall remain in force, but the administering authority shall not issue an antidumping duty order in the case so long as—

                (i) the agreement remains in force,

                (ii) the agreement continues to meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d), or (c) and (d), and

                (iii) the parties to the agreement carry out their obligations under the agreement in accordance with its terms.

    (g) __Investigation to be continued upon request__ 

    If the administering authority, within 20 days after the date of publication of the notice of suspension of an investigation, receives a request for the continuation of the investigation from—

        (1) an exporter or exporters accounting for a significant proportion of exports to the United States of the subject merchandise, or

        (2) __Commission investigation__ 

            Upon receipt of a review petition under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, within 75 days after the date on which the petition is filed with it, determine whether the injurious effect of imports of the subject merchandise is eliminated completely by the agreement. If the Commission’s determination under this subsection is negative, the investigation shall be resumed on the date of publication of notice of such determination as if the affirmative preliminary determination under [section 1673b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/b] had been made on that date.

        (3) __Suspension of liquidation to continue during review period__

    (j) __Determination not to take agreement into account__
