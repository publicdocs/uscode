## § 1673e. Assessment of duty

    (a) __Publication of antidumping duty order__ 

    Within 7 days after being notified by the Commission of an affirmative determination under [section 1673d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/b], the administering authority shall publish an antidumping duty order which—

        (1)

         directs customs officers to assess an antidumping duty equal to the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise, within 6 months after the date on which the administering authority receives satisfactory information upon which the assessment may be based, but in no event later than—

            (A) 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which the merchandise is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, or

            (B) in the case of merchandise not sold prior to its importation into the United States, 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which it is sold in the United States to a person who is not the exporter of that merchandise,

        (2) includes a description of the subject merchandise, in such detail as the administering authority deems necessary, and

        (3) requires the deposit of estimated antidumping duties pending liquidation of entries of merchandise at the same time as estimated normal customs duties on that merchandise are deposited.

    (b) __Imposition of duty__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            If the Commission, in its final determination under [section 1673d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/b], finds material injury or threat of material injury which, but for the suspension of liquidation under [section 1673b(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/d/2] would have led to a finding of material injury, then entries of the subject merchandise, the liquidation of which has been suspended under [section 1673b(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/d/2], shall be subject to the imposition of antidumping duties under [section 1673 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673].

        (2) __Special rule__ 

            If the Commission, in its final determination under [section 1673d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/b], finds threat of material injury, other than threat of material injury described in paragraph (1), or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States, then subject merchandise which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of notice of an affirmative determination of the Commission under [section 1673d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/b] shall be subject to the assessment of antidumping duties under [section 1673 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673], and the administering authority shall release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit made, to secure the payment of anti­dumping duties with respect to entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.

    (c) __Security in lieu of estimated duty pending early determination of duty__ 

        (1) __Conditions for waiver of deposit of estimated duties__ 

        The administering authority may permit, for not more than 90 days after the date of publication of an order under subsection (a), the posting of a bond or other security in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties required under subsection (a)(3) if—

            (A)

             the investigation has not been designated as extraordinarily complicated by reason of—

                (i) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,

                (ii) the novelty of the issues presented, or

                (iii) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated,

            (B) the final determination in the investigation has not been postponed under [section 1673d(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/a/2/A];

            (C)

             on the basis of information presented to the administering authority by any manufacturer, producer, or exporter in such form and within such time as the administering authority may require, the administering authority is satisfied that a determination will be made, within 90 days after the date of publication of an order under subsection (a), of the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) for all merchandise of such manufacturer, producer, or exporter described in that order which was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of—

                (i) an affirmative preliminary determination by the administering authority under [section 1673b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/b], or

                (ii) if its determination under [section 1673b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673b/b] was negative, an affirmative final determination by the administering authority under [section 1673d(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/a],

                and before the date of publication of the affirmative final determination by the Commission under [section 1673d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673d/b];

            (D) the party described in subparagraph (C) provides credible evidence that the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the antidumping duty order published under subsection (a); and

            (E) the data concerning the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) apply to sales in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison.

        (2) __Notice; hearing__ 

        If the administering authority permits the posting of a bond or other security in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties under paragraph (1), it shall—

            (A) publish notice of its action in the Federal Register, and

            (B) upon the request of any interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with [section 1677c of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677c] before determining the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise.

        (3) __Determinations to be basis of antidumping duty__ 

            The administering authority shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the results of its determination of normal value and export price (or the constructed export price), and that determination shall be the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise to which the notice under this subsection applies and also shall be the basis for the deposit of estimated antidumping duties on future entries of merchandise of manufacturers, producers, or exporters described in paragraph (1) to which the order issued under subsection (a) applies.

        (4) __Provision of business proprietary information; written comments__ 

        Before determining whether to permit the posting of bond or other security under paragraph (1) in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties, the administering authority shall—

            (A) make all business proprietary information supplied to the administering authority under paragraph (1) available under a protective order in accordance with [section 1677f(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677f/c] to all interested parties described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of [section 1677(9) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/9], and

            (B) afford all interested parties an opportunity to file written comments on whether the posting of bond or other security under paragraph (1) in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties should be permitted.

    (d) __Special rule for regional industries__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In an investigation in which the Commission makes a regional industry determination under [section 1677(4)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/4/C], the administering authority shall, to the maximum extent possible, direct that duties be assessed only on the subject merchandise of the specific exporters or producers that exported the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned during the period of investigation.

        (2) __Exception for new exporters and producers__ 

            After publication of the antidumping duty order, if the administering authority finds that a new exporter or producer is exporting the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned, the administering authority shall direct that duties be assessed on the subject merchandise of the new exporter or producer consistent with the provisions of [section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/a/2/B].
