## § 1495. Partnership bond

    When any bond is required by law or regulations to be executed by any partnership for any purpose connected with the transaction of business at any customhouse, the execution of such bond by any member of such partnership shall bind the other partners in like manner and to the same extent as if such other partners had personally joined in the execution, and an action or suit may be instituted on such bond against all partners as if all had executed the same.
