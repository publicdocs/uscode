        (2) if the administering authority initiates a proceeding under paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether imports of the merchandise of the kind subject to the agreement will, upon termination of the agreement, materially injure, or threaten with material injury, an industry in the United States or materially retard the establishment of such an industry.

    (b) __Determinations__ 

    The determinations required to be made by the administering authority and the Commission under subsection (a) shall be made under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission, respectively, shall by regulation prescribe, and shall be treated as final determinations made under [section 1671d of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671d] for purposes of judicial review under [section 1516a of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1516a].

        (1) issue a countervailing duty order under [section 1671e of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671e] effective with respect to merchandise entered on and after the date on which the agreement terminates; and

    (c) __Hearings__ 

        The determination proceedings required to be prescribed under subsection (b) shall provide that the administering authority and the Commission must, upon the request of any interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with [section 1677c of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677c] on the issues involved.
