## § 1671c. Termination or suspension of investigation

    (a) __Termination of investigation upon withdrawal of petition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Withdrawal of petition__ 

                Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), an investigation under this part may be terminated by either the administering authority or the Commission, after notice to all parties to the investigation, upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner or by the administering authority if the investigation was initiated under [section 1671a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671a/a].

            (B) __Refiling of petition__ 

                If, within 3 months after the withdrawal of a petition under subparagraph (A), a new petition is filed seeking the imposition of duties on both the subject merchandise of the withdrawn petition and the subject merchandise from another country, the administering authority and the Commission may use in the investigation initiated pursuant to the new petition any records compiled in an investigation conducted pursuant to the withdrawn petition. This subparagraph applies only with respect to the first withdrawal of a petition.

        (2) __Special rules for quantitative restriction agreements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by accepting, with the government of the country in which the countervailable subsidy practice is alleged to occur, an understanding or other kind of agreement to limit the volume of imports into the United States of the subject merchandise unless the administering authority is satisfied that termination on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.

            (B) __Public interest factors__ 

            In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall take into account—

                (i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of countervailing duties;

                (ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and

                (iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.

            (C) __Prior consultations__ 

            Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—

                (i) potentially affected consuming industries; and

                (ii) potentially affected producers and workers in the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including producers and workers not party to the investigation.

        (3) __Limitation on termination by Commission__ 

            The Commission may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) before a preliminary determination is made by the administering authority under [section 1671b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671b/b].

    (b) __Agreements to eliminate or offset completely a countervailable subsidy or to cease exports of subject merchandise__ 

    The administering authority may suspend an investigation if the government of the country in which the countervailable subsidy practice is alleged to occur agrees, or exporters who account for substantially all of the imports of the subject merchandise agree—

        (1) to eliminate the countervailable subsidy completely or to offset completely the amount of the net countervailable subsidy, with respect to that merchandise exported directly or indirectly to the United States, within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended, or

        (2) to cease exports of that merchandise to the United States within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended.

    (c) __Agreements eliminating injurious effect__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement from a government described in subsection (b) of this section, or from exporters described in subsection (b) of this section, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of the subject merchandise.

        (2) __Certain additional requirements__ 

        Except in the case of an agreement by a foreign government to restrict the volume of imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, the administering authority may not accept an agreement under this subsection unless—

            (A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and

            (B) at least 85 percent of the net countervailable subsidy will be offset.

        (3) __Quantitative restrictions agreements__ 

            The administering authority may accept an agreement with a foreign government under this subsection to restrict the volume of imports of subject merchandise into the United States, but it may not accept such an agreement with exporters.

        (4) __Definition of extraordinary circumstances__ 

            (A) __Extraordinary circumstances__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “extraordinary circumstances” means circumstances in which—

                (i) suspension of an investigation will be more beneficial to the domestic industry than continuation of the investigation, and

                (ii) the investigation is complex.

            (B) __Complex__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “complex” means—

                (i) there are a large number of alleged countervailable subsidy practices and the practices are complicated,

                (ii) the issues raised are novel, or

                (iii) the number of exporters involved is large.

    (d) __Additional rules and conditions__ 

        (1) __Public interest; monitoring__ 

        The administering authority shall not accept an agreement under subsection (b) or (c) of this section unless—

            (A) it is satisfied that suspension of the investigation is in the public interest, and

            (B) effective monitoring of the agreement by the United States is practicable.

            Where practicable, the administering authority shall provide to the exporters who would have been subject to the agreement the reasons for not accepting the agreement and, to the extent possible, an opportunity to submit comments thereon. In applying subparagraph (A) with respect to any quantitative restriction agreement under subsection (c) of this section, the administering authority shall take into account, in addition to such other factors as are considered necessary or appropriate, the factors set forth in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section as they apply to the proposed suspension and agreement, after consulting with the appropriate consuming industries, producers, and workers referred to in subsection (a)(2)(C)(i) and (ii) of this section.

        (2) __Exports of merchandise to United States not to increase during interim period__ 

            The administering authority may not accept any agreement under subsection (b) of this section unless that agreement provides a means of ensuring that the quantity of the merchandise covered by that agreement exported to the United States during the period provided for elimination or offset of the countervailable subsidy or cessation of exports does not exceed the quantity of such merchandise exported to the United States during the most recent representative period determined by the administering authority.

        (3) __Regulations governing entry or withdrawals__ 

            In order to carry out an agreement concluded under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the administering authority is authorized to prescribe regulations governing the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of subject merchandise.

    (e) __Suspension of investigation procedure__ 

    Before an investigation may be suspended under subsection (b) or (c) of this section the administering authority shall—

        (2) provide a copy of the proposed agreement to the petitioner at the time of the notification, together with an explanation of how the agreement will be carried out and enforced (including any action required of foreign governments), and of how the agreement will meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d) or (c) and (d) of this section, and

        (3) permit all interested parties described in [section 1677(9) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/9] to submit comments and information for the record before the date on which notice of suspension of the investigation is published under subsection (f)(1)(A) of this section.

            (B) the Commission shall suspend any investigation it is conducting with respect to that merchandise, and
