L. 98–573, title II][/us/pl/98/573/tII], § 213(a)(5), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2985][/us/stat/98/2985]; [Pub. L. 99–570, title I][/us/pl/99/570/tI], § 1862, Oct. 27, 1986, [100 Stat. 3207–54][/us/stat/100/3207-54]; [Pub.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Provisions similar to those in this section were contained in R.S. § 3076, which was superseded by [act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch356/tIV], § 608, [42 Stat. 985][/us/stat/42/985], and was repealed by section 642 thereof. Section 608 of the 1922 act was superseded by section 608 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by section 651(a)(1) of the 1930 act.

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] reenacted section without change. See 1984 and 1986 Amendment notes below.

    [Pub.

L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473], and to reflect the probable intent of Congress to repeal the amendment made by [Pub. L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473] in view of later amendment by [Pub. L. 98–573][/us/pl/98/573]. See 1984 Amendment notes below.

L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473] to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See 1986 Amendment note above.

    [Pub. L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473], § 312, inserted “$5,000 or 10 per centum of the value of the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than,” after “penal sum of”. See 1984 and 1986 Amendment notes above.

    [Pub. L. 98–573][/us/pl/98/573], § 213(a)(5)(A), and [Pub. L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473], § 321, inserted reference to aircraft.
