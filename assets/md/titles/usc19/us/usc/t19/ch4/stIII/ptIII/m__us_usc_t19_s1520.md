        (3) __Fines, penalties, and forfeitures.—__ 

        Whenever money has been deposited in the Treasury on account of a fine, penalty, or forfeiture which did not accrue, or which is finally determined to have accrued in an amount less than that so deposited, or which is mitigated to an amount less than that so deposited or is remitted.

        (4) __Prior to liquidation.—__
