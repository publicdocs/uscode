            the Commission, upon receipt of a request from an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title for an injury investigation with respect to such order, shall initiate an investigation and shall determine whether an industry in the United States is likely to be materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked.

        (2) __Description of countervailing duty orders__ 

            A countervailing duty order described in this paragraph is an order issued under section 1303  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title or [section 1671(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671/c] with respect to which the requirement of an affirmative determination of material injury was not applicable at the time such order was issued.

        (3) __Requirements of request for investigation__ 

        A request for an investigation under this subsection shall be submitted—

            (A) in the case of an order described in paragraph (1)(B)(i), within 6 months after the date on which the country described in paragraph (1)(A) becomes a Subsidies Agreement country, or

        (1) __Commission procedure__ 

            (A) __In general__

                In the case of requests for investigations received under this section within 1 year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, the Commission may, after consulting with the administering authority, initiate its investigations in a manner that results in determinations being made in all such investigations during the 4-year period beginning on such date.

        (2) __Net countervailable subsidy; nature of subsidy__ 

            (A) __Net countervailable subsidy__ 

                The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order which is the subject of the investigation is revoked. The administering authority normally shall choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under [section 1671d of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671d] or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of [section 1675 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675]. If the Commission considers the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy in making its determination under this section, the Commission shall use the net countervailable subsidy provided by the administering authority.

            (B) __Nature of subsidy__

            (B) __Negative determination__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Upon being notified by the Commission that it has made a negative determination under subsection (a)(1), the administering authority shall revoke the countervailing duty order, and shall refund, with interest, any estimated countervailing duties collected during the period liquidation was suspended pursuant to subsection (a)(4).

                (ii) __Limitation on negative determination__ 

                    A determination by the Commission that revocation of the order is not likely to result in material injury to an industry by reason of imports of the subject merchandise shall not be based, in whole or in part, on any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States that were specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.

        (4) __Countervailing duty orders with respect to which no request for injury investigation is made__ 

            If, with respect to a countervailing duty order described in subsection (a), a request for an investigation is not made within the time required by subsection (a)(3), the Commission shall notify the administering authority that a negative determination has been made under subsection (a) and the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) shall apply with respect to the order.

        (1) in the case of an investigation in progress, make a final determination under [section 1671d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671d/b] within 75 days after the date of an affirmative final determination, if any, by the administering authority,

        (2) in the case of a suspended investigation to which [section 1671c(i)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671c/i/1/B] applies, make a final determination under [section 1671d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671d/b] within 120 days after receiving notice from the administering authority of the resumption of the investigation pursuant to [section 1671c(i) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671c/i], or within 45 days after the date of an affirmative final determination, if any, by the administering authority, whichever is later, or

            (A) an order issued under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) for purposes of subsection (a)(3); and

            (B) an order issued under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i) for purposes of subsection (a)(4).

    (d) __Publication in Federal Register__

        (1) __General rule__ 

            (A) __Requests for reviews__ 

                Notwithstanding [section 1675(c)(6)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c/6/A] and except as provided in subparagraph (B), an interested party may request a review of an order under [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] at the same time the party requests an investigation under subsection (a), if the order involves the same or comparable subject merchandise. Upon receipt of such request, the administering authority, after consulting with the Commission, shall initiate a review of the order under [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c]. The Commission shall combine such review with the investigation under this section.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                If the administering authority determines that the interested party who requested an investigation under this section is a related party or an importer within the meaning of [section 1677(4)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/4/B], the administering authority may decline a request by such party to initiate a review of an order under [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] which involves the same or comparable subject merchandise.

        (2) __Cumulation__ 

            If a review under [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] is initiated under paragraph (1), such review shall be treated as having been initiated on the same day as the investigation under this section, and the Commission may, in accordance with [section 1677(7)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/7/G], cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which such investigations are treated as initiated on the same day.

        (3) __Time and procedure for Commission determination__ 

            The Commission shall render its determination in the investigation conducted under this section at the same time as the Commission’s determination is made in the review under [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] that is initiated pursuant to this subsection. The Commission shall in all other respects apply the procedures and standards set forth in [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] to such [section 1675(c) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1675/c] reviews.
