    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Administering authority__ 

            The term “administering authority” has the meaning given that term in [section 1677(1) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1677/1].

        (2) __Commissioner__ 

            The term “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

        (3) __Covered merchandise__ 

        The term “covered merchandise” means merchandise that is subject to—

            (A) an antidumping duty order issued under [section 1673e of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1673e]; or

            (B) a countervailing duty order issued under [section 1671e of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1671e].

        (4) __Enter; entry__ 

            The terms “enter” and “entry” refer to the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of merchandise into the customs territory of the United States.

        (5) __Evasion__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “evasion” refers to entering covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of any document or electronically transmitted data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that is material, and that results in any cash deposit or other security or any amount of applicable antidumping or countervailing duties being reduced or not being applied with respect to the merchandise.

            (B) __Exception for clerical error__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in clause (ii), the term “evasion” does not include entering covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of—

                    (I) a document or electronically transmitted data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is false as a result of a clerical error; or

                    (II) an omission that results from a clerical error.

                (ii) __Patterns of negligent conduct__ 

                    If the Commissioner determines that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of a clerical error referred to in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) and that the clerical error is part of a pattern of negligent conduct on the part of that person, the Commissioner may determine, notwithstanding clause (i), that the person has entered such covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

                (iii) __Electronic repetition of errors__ 

                    For purposes of clause (ii), the mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.

                (iv) __Rule of construction__ 

                    A determination by the Commissioner that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States by means of a clerical error referred to in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) rather than through evasion shall not be construed to excuse that person from the payment of any duties applicable to the merchandise.

        (6) __Interested party__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “interested party” means—

                (i) a foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or the United States importer, of covered merchandise or a trade or business association a majority of the members of which are producers, exporters, or importers of such merchandise;

                (ii) a manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a domestic like product;

    (b) __Investigations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 15 business days after receiving an allegation described in paragraph (2) or a referral described in paragraph (3), the Commissioner shall initiate an investigation if the Commissioner determines that the information provided in the allegation or the referral, as the case may be, reasonably suggests that covered merchandise has been entered into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

        (2) __Allegation described__ 

        An allegation described in this paragraph is an allegation that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion that is—

        (4) __Consideration by administering authority__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the Commissioner receives an allegation under paragraph (2) and is unable to determine whether the merchandise at issue is covered merchandise, the Commissioner shall—

                (ii) notify the party that filed the allegation, and any other interested party participating in the investigation, of the referral.

            (B) __Determination; transmission to Commissioner__

                The period required for any referral and determination under this paragraph shall not be counted in calculating any deadline under this section.

            (D) __Rule of construction__

        (6) __Information-sharing to protect health and safety__ 

            If, during the course of conducting an investigation under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner has reason to suspect that such covered merchandise may pose a health or safety risk to consumers, the Commissioner shall provide, as appropriate, information to the appropriate Federal agencies for purposes of mitigating the risk.

        (7) __Technical assistance and advice__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Upon request, the Commissioner shall provide technical assistance and advice to eligible small businesses to enable such businesses to prepare and submit allegations described in paragraph (2), except that the Commissioner may deny technical assistance if the Commissioner concludes that the allegation, if submitted, would not lead to the initiation of an investigation under this subsection or any other action to address the allegation.

            (B) __Eligible small business defined__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In this paragraph, the term “eligible small business” means any business concern that the Commissioner determines, due to its small size, has neither adequate internal resources nor the financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and filing allegations described in paragraph (2).

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), not later than 300 calendar days after the date on which the Commissioner initiates an investigation under subsection (b) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner shall make a determination, based on substantial evidence, with respect to whether such covered merchandise was entered into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

            (B) __Additional time__ 

            The Commissioner may extend the time to make a determination under subparagraph (A) by not more than 60 calendar days if the Commissioner determines that—

                (i)

                 the investigation is extraordinarily complicated because of—

                    (I) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated;

                    (II) the novelty of the issues presented; or

                    (III) the number of entities to be investigated; and

                (ii) additional time is necessary to make the determination under subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Authority to collect and verify additional information__ 

        In making a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner may collect such additional information as is necessary to make the determination through such methods as the Commissioner considers appropriate, including by—

            (A)

             issuing a questionnaire with respect to such covered merchandise to—

                (i) an interested party that filed an allegation under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) that resulted in the initiation of an investigation under paragraph (1) of that subsection with respect to such covered merchandise;

                (ii) a person alleged to have entered such covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion;

            (B) conducting verifications, including on-site verifications, of any relevant information.

        (3) __Adverse inference__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the Commissioner finds that a party or person described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of the party or person’s ability to comply with a request for information, the Commissioner may, in making a determination under paragraph (1), use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party or person in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination.

            (B) __Application__ 

                An inference described in subparagraph (A) may be used under that subparagraph with respect to a person described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) without regard to whether another person involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by the Commissioner, such as import or export documentation.

            (C) __Adverse inference described__ 

            An adverse inference used under subparagraph (A) may include reliance on information derived from—

                (i) the allegation of evasion of the trade remedy laws, if any, submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection;

                (ii) a determination by the Commissioner in another investigation, proceeding, or other action regarding evasion of the unfair trade laws; or

        Not later than 5 business days after making a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner—

            (A) shall provide to each interested party that filed an allegation under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) that resulted in the initiation of an investigation under paragraph (1) of that subsection with respect to such covered merchandise a notification of the determination and may, in addition, include an explanation of the basis for the determination; and

            (B) may provide to importers, in such manner as the Commissioner determines appropriate, information discovered in the investigation that the Commissioner determines will help educate importers with respect to importing merchandise into the customs territory of the United States in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

    (d) __Effect of determinations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (c) that covered merchandise was entered into the customs territory of the United States through evasion, the Commissioner shall—
