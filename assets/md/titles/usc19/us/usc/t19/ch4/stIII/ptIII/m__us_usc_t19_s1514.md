When a judgment or order of the United States Court of International Trade has become final, the papers transmitted shall be returned, together with a copy of the judgment or order to the Customs Service, which shall take action accordingly.

    (b) __Finality of determinations__ 

        With respect to determinations made under section 1303  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title or subtitle IV of this chapter which are reviewable under [section 1516a of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1516a], determinations of the Customs Service are final and conclusive upon all persons (including the United States and any officer thereof) unless a civil action contesting a determination listed in [section 1516a of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1516a] is commenced in the United States Court of International Trade, or review by a binational panel of a determination to which [section 1516a(g)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1516a/g/2] applies is commenced pursuant to [section 1516a(g) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1516a/g] and article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement or the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement.

    (c) __Form, number, and amendment of protest; filing of protest__ 

        (1)

         A protest of a decision made under subsection (a) shall be filed in writing, or transmitted electronically pursuant to an electronic data interchange system, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A protest must set forth distinctly and specifically—

            (A) each decision described in subsection (a) as to which protest is made;

            (B) each category of merchandise affected by each decision set forth under paragraph (1);

            (C) the nature of each objection and the reasons therefor; and

            (D) any other matter required by the Secretary by regulation.

            Only one protest may be filed for each entry of merchandise, except that where the entry covers merchandise of different categories, a separate protest may be filed for each category. In addition, separate protests filed by different authorized persons with respect to any one category of merchandise, or with respect to a determination of origin under [section 3332 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3332], that is the subject of a protest are deemed to be part of a single protest. Unless a request for accelerated disposition is filed under [section 1515(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1515/b], a protest may be amended, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to set forth objections as to a decision or decisions described in subsection (a) which were not the subject of the original protest, in the form and manner prescribed for a protest, any time prior to the expiration of the time in which such protest could have been filed under this section. New grounds in support of objections raised by a valid protest or amendment thereto may be presented for consideration in connection with the review of such protest pursuant to [section 1515 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1515] at any time prior to the disposition of the protest in accordance with that section.

        (2)

         Except as provided in sections 1485(d) and 1557(b) of this title, protests may be filed with respect to merchandise which is the subject of a decision specified in subsection (a) by—

            (A) the importers or consignees shown on the entry papers, or their sureties;

            (B) any person paying any charge or exaction;

            (C) any person seeking entry or delivery;

            (D) any person filing a claim for drawback;

            (E) with respect to a determination of origin under [section 3332 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3332], any exporter or producer of the merchandise subject to that determination, if the exporter or producer completed and signed a NAFTA Certificate of Origin covering the merchandise; or

            (F) any authorized agent of any of the persons described in clauses (A) through (E).

        (3)

         A protest of a decision, order, or finding described in subsection (a) shall be filed with the Customs Service within 180 days after but not before—

            (A) date of liquidation or reliquidation, or

            (B) in circumstances where subparagraph (A) is inapplicable, the date of the decision as to which protest is made.

            A protest by a surety which has an unsatisfied legal claim under its bond may be filed within 180 days from the date of mailing of notice of demand for payment against its bond. If another party has not filed a timely protest, the surety’s protest shall certify that it is not being filed collusively to extend another authorized person’s time to protest as specified in this subsection.

    (d) __Limitation on protest of reliquidation__ 

        The reliquidation of an entry shall not open such entry so that a protest may be filed against the decision of the Customs Service upon any question not involved in such reliquidation.

    (e) __Advance notice of certain determinations__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (f), an exporter or producer referred to in subsection (c)(2)(E) shall be provided notice in advance of an adverse determination of origin under [section 3332 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3332]. The Secretary may, by regulations, prescribe the time period in which such advance notice shall be issued and authorize the Customs Service to provide in the notice the entry number and any other entry information considered necessary to allow the exporter or producer to exercise the rights provided by this section.

    (f) __Denial of preferential treatment__ 

    If the Customs Service finds indications of a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations that goods qualify under the rules of origin set out in [section 3332 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3332]—

        (1) the Customs Service, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, may deny preferential tariff treatment to entries of identical goods exported or produced by that person; and

        (2) the advance notice requirement in subsection (e) shall not apply to that person;
