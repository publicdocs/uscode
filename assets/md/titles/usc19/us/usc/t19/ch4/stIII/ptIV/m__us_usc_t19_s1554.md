## § 1554. Transportation through contiguous countries

    With the consent of the proper authorities, imported merchandise, in bond or duty-paid, and products and manufactures of the United States may be transported from one port to another in the United States through contiguous countries, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe, unless such transportation is in violation of section 4347 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, [section 55102 of title 46][/us/usc/t46/s55102], or [section 1588 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1588].

([June 17, 1930, ch. 497][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch497], title IV, § 554, [46 Stat. 743][/us/stat/46/743].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 4347 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, referred to in text, was not classified to the Code. It was superseded by [act Feb. 17, 1898, ch. 26][/us/act/1898-02-17/ch26], § 1, [30 Stat. 248][/us/stat/30/248], which was classified to section 290 of former Title 46, Shipping, and was subsequently repealed by [Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], § 19, Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1710][/us/stat/120/1710]. Provisions similar to those in section 1 of [act Feb. 17, 1898, ch. 26][/us/act/1898-02-17/ch26], were also contained in section 27 of [act June 5, 1920, ch. 250][/us/act/1920-06-05/ch250], [41 Stat. 999][/us/stat/41/999], and were classified to section 883 of the former Appendix to Title 46, Shipping. For disposition of sections of the former Appendix to Title 46, see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of Title 46][/us/usc/t46/s101].

 __Codification__ 

    In text, “[section 55102 of title 46][/us/usc/t46/s55102]” substituted for “section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920” on authority of [Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], § 18(c), Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1709][/us/stat/120/1709], which Act enacted [section 55102 of Title 46][/us/usc/t46/s55102], Shipping.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Provisions similar to those in this section were contained in [act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch356/tIV], § 554, [42 Stat. 976][/us/stat/42/976]. That section was superseded by section 554 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by section 651(a)(1) of the 1930 act.

    Prior provisions the same in effect as those in this section, except that they did not contain the provision commencing with the words “unless such transportation,” were contained in R.S. § 3006, which also provided that the merchandise transported should be treated as if transported entirely within the United States. R.S. § 3007 exempted cars and vehicles from the payment of fees for receiving or certifying manifests. Both sections were repealed by [act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch356/tIV], § 642, [42 Stat. 989][/us/stat/42/989].
