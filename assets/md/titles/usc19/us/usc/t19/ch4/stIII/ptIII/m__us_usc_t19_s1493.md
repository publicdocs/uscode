 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Provisions substantially similar in most respects to those in this section, with further provisions concerning the documents to be forwarded by the collector to the Treasury Department, were contained in R.S. § 2974, which was superseded and more nearly assimilated to the present section by [act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch356/tIV], § 493, [42 Stat. 964][/us/stat/42/964], and repealed by section 642 thereof. Section 493 of the 1922 act was superseded by section 493 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by section 651(a)(1) of the 1930 act.

 __Amendments__ 

    1993—[Pub. L. 103–182][/us/pl/103/182] inserted “taxes, and fees,” after “duties,”, struck out “by the appropriate customs officer” after “shall be deposited”, and substituted “the Customs Service” for “such customs officer”.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–271][/us/pl/91/271] substituted references to appropriate customs officer or such customs officer for references to collector wherever appearing.

 __Effective Date of 1970 Amendment__
