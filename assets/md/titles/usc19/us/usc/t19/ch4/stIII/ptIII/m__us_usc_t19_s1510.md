    (a) __Order of court__ 

        If any person summoned under [section 1509 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1509] does not comply with the summons, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found or resides or is doing business, upon application and after notice to any such person and hearing, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to comply with the summons. Failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof and such court may assess a monetary penalty.

    (b) __Sanctions__ 

        (1)

         For so long as any person, after being adjudged guilty of contempt for neglecting or refusing to obey a lawful summons issued under [section 1509 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s1509] and for refusing to obey the order of the court, remains in contempt, the Secretary may—

            (A) prohibit that person from importing merchandise into the customs territory of the United States directly or indirectly or for his account, and

            (B) instruct the appropriate customs officers to withhold delivery of merchandise imported directly or indirectly by that person or for his account.

        (2) If any person remains in contempt for more than one year after the date on which the Secretary issues instructions under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to that person, the appropriate customs officers shall cause all merchandise held in customs custody pursuant to such instructions to be sold at public auction or otherwise disposed of under the customs laws.

        (3) The sanctions which may be imposed under paragraphs (1) and (2) are in addition to any punishment which may be imposed by the court for contempt.
