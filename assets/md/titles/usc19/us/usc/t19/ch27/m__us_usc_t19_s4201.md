    (a) __Overall trade negotiating objectives__ 

    The overall trade negotiating objectives of the United States for agreements subject to the provisions of [section 4202 of this title][/us/usc/t19/s4202] are—

        (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access;

        (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, enhance the competitiveness of the United States, promote full employment in the United States, and enhance the global economy;

        (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as set out in [section 4210(7) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s4210/7]) and an understanding of the relationship between trade and worker rights;

        (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;

        (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses equal access to international markets, equitable trade benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and provide for the reduction or elimination of trade and investment barriers that disproportionately impact small businesses;

    (b) __Principal trade negotiating objectives__ 

        (1) __Trade in goods__ 

        The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade in goods are—

            (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade, including through the utilization of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign governments directly related to trade that decrease market opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort United States trade; and

            (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier elimination agreements, including with respect to those tariff categories covered in [section 3521(b) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3521/b].

        (2) __Trade in services__ 

            (A) The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding trade in services is to expand competitive market opportunities for United States services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade, including through utilization of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict the establishment or operations of service suppliers.

            (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able to undertake high standard services commitments for both existing and new services.

        (3) __Trade in agriculture__ 

        The principal negotiating objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and value added commodities by—

            (A)

             securing more open and equitable market access through robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that—

                while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner consistent with their international obligations, including the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in [section 3511(d)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t19/s3511/d/3]);

                (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, including biotechnology;

                (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, including restrictions not based on scientific principles in contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements or bilateral or regional trade agreements;

                (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and

                (v) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate quotas;

            (J) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in perishable or cyclical products, while improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of perishable and cyclical agriculture;
