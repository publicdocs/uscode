    10:1344 (last 40 words) is omitted as executed. The words “tract or tracts”, in 10:1342 and 1344, are omitted as surplusage. The words “and remount station”, in 10:1342, are omitted, since the property and civilian personnel of the Remount Service of the Quartermaster Corps were transferred to the Department of Agriculture by the [Act of April 21, 1948, ch. 224][/us/act/1948-04-21/ch224], [62 Stat. 197][/us/stat/62/197] ([7 U.S.C. 436–438][/us/usc/t7/s436–438]).

The words “from any person”, in 10:1344, are omitted as surplusage.
