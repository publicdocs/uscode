## § 4332. Departments and professors: titles

    (a) The Secretary of the Army may prescribe the titles of each of the departments of instruction and the professors of the Academy. However, the change of the title of a department or officer does not affect the status, rank, or eligibility for promotion or retirement of, or otherwise prejudice, a professor at the Academy.

    (b) Upon becoming the senior professor in a department, a permanent professor thereby becomes the head of that department.

    In subsection (a), the words “now or after December 14, 1942, established at” are omitted as surplusage. The word “precedence” is omitted as covered by the word “rank”. The words “pay, allowances” are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. The words “from time to time”, “shall be known”, and “operate in any case or on any account” are omitted as surplusage.
