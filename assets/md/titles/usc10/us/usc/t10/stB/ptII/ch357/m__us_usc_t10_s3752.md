    In subsection (a), the words “If a person” are substituted for the words “In case an individual \* \* \* dies”, in 10:1409, and “In case an individual \* \* \* shall have died”, in 10:1429. The words “within three years from the date”, in 10:1409, are omitted as covered by [section 3744 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s3744]. The words “who shall distinguish himself”, in 10:1409, and “who distinguishes himself”, in 10:1429, are omitted as covered by the words “the award \* \* \* to which he is entitled”.

 __1958__  __Act__ 

    The change reflects the fact that the source statute for these sections (sec. 1 of the [Act of May 12, 1928, ch. 528][/us/act/1928-05-12/ch528], [45 Stat. 500][/us/stat/45/500]) was mandatory and not merely permissive.

 __Amendments__ 

    1958—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] substituted “it shall be presented” for “it may be presented”.

 __Effective Date of 1958 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] effective Aug. 10, 1956, see [section 33(g) of Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861/s33/g], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
