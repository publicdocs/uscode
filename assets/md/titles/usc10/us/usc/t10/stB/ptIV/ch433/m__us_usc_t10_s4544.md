            (A) in any case of willful misconduct or gross negligence; and

    (h)  __Exclusion From Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair Percentage Limitation__  __.—__ 

    Amounts expended for the performance of a depot-level maintenance and repair workload by non-Federal Government personnel at an Army industrial facility shall not be counted for purposes of applying the percentage limitation in [section 2466(a) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2466/a] if the personnel are provided by a non-Army entity pursuant to a cooperative arrangement entered into under subsection (a).
