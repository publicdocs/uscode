The words “basic pay \* \* \* as the case may be” are inserted to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 802][/us/stat/63/802] ([37 U.S.C. 231][/us/usc/t37/s231] et seq.). The words “at the rate prescribed by law for his length of service”, in 10:1004, are omitted as covered by the words “base and longevity pay”. The words “base and longevity pay” are retained to cover the cases of members retired before the enactment of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, and advanced on the retired list after the enactment of that act. The words “and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months” are inserted to conform to footnote 4 of [section 3991 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s3991].

 __1982__  __Act__ 

    This amends 10:3992 to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956 relating to retirement pay of warrant officers advanced on the retired list. For further details, see the explanation for amendment of 10:1405 made by section 1(17).

 __Amendments__
