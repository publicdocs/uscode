    The words “under the provisions of the [Act of Apr. 3, 1939, ch. 35][/us/act/1939-04-03/ch35], [53 Stat. 555][/us/stat/53/555]” are omitted as obsolete, since training formerly performed under that act is now performed under [section 4301 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4301]. The words “personnel of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force” are substituted for the words “flying cadets”, since the authority is reciprocal, and to conform to [section 4656 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4656]. The words “flying cadet” are omitted as obsolete. 10:298c (last 28 words) is omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended ([63 Stat. 585][/us/stat/63/585]), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)
