## § 4303. Army Ranger training: instructor staffing; safety

    (a)  __Levels of Personnel Assigned__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary of the Army shall ensure that at all times the number of officers, and the number of enlisted members, permanently assigned to the Ranger Training Brigade (or other organizational element of the Army primarily responsible for Ranger student training) are not less than 90 percent of the required manning spaces for officers, and for enlisted members, respectively, for that brigade.

        (2) In this subsection, the term “required manning spaces” means the number of personnel spaces for officers, and the number of personnel spaces for enlisted members, that are designated in Army authorization documents as the number required to accomplish the missions of a particular unit or organization.

    (b)  __Training Safety Cells__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary of the Army shall establish and maintain an organizational entity known as a “safety cell” as part of the organizational elements of the Army responsible for conducting each of the three major phases of the Ranger Course. The safety cell in each different geographic area of Ranger Course training shall be comprised of personnel who have sufficient continuity and experience in that geographic area of such training to be knowledgeable of the local conditions year-round, including conditions of terrain, weather, water, and climate and other conditions and the potential effect on those conditions on Ranger student training and safety.

        (2) Members of each safety cell shall be assigned in sufficient numbers to serve as advisers to the officers in charge of the major phase of Ranger training and shall assist those officers in making informed daily “go” and “no-go” decisions regarding training in light of all relevant conditions, including conditions of terrain, weather, water, and climate and other conditions.
