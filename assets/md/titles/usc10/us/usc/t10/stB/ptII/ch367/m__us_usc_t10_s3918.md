    The word “commissioned” is inserted, since the retirement of warrant officers for length of service is covered by [section 1293 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1293]. The word “regular” is inserted, since 10:943 is applicable historically only to officers of the Regular Army. The words “and placed on the retired list” are omitted as surplusage. The words “computed under [section 3926 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s3926]” are inserted for clarity.

 __Delegation of Functions__ 

    Functions of the President under this section to approve the request of a regular commissioned officer of the Army to retire after at least 30 years of service delegated to the Secretary of Defense to perform, without approval, ratification, or other action of the President, and with authority for the Secretary to redelegate, see Ex. Ord. No. 12396, §§ 1(f), 3, Dec. 9, 1982, 47 F.R. 55897, 55898, set out as a note under [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], The President.
