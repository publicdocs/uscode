    In subsection (b), the word “grade” is substituted for the word “rank”. The words “pay, allowances” are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. The words “retirement rights” are omitted as covered by the word “benefits”. The words “There is authorized”, “from time to time”, and “statutory” are omitted as surplusage.

 __1958__  __Act__ 

    The word “regular” is deleted \[in sections 4335 and 4336\] to make clear that a Dean or professor of the United States Military Academy holds only the office of “Dean” or “professor” and not the office of “brigadier general” or “colonel”, as the case may be, even though he is entitled to the pay and allowances of that grade.

 __Amendments__

However, the retirement age of an officer so appointed is that of a permanent professor of the Academy.”

    1986—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 99–661][/us/pl/99/661], § 508(a)(1), struck out “The Dean has the grade of brigadier general while serving as such, with the benefits authorized for regular brigadier generals of the Army, except that his retirement age is that of a permanent professor of the Academy.” See subsec. (c).

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 99–661][/us/pl/99/661], § 508(a)(2), added subsec. (c).
