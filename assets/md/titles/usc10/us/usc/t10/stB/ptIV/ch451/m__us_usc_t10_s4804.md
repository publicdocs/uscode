    The words “under this section” are substituted for the words “for salvage services rendered”. The words “consider, ascertain, adjust, determine” are omitted as covered by the word “settle”, as defined in [section 4801 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4801]. The words “and receive payment of” are inserted for clarity and to conform to [section 4803 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4803]. The words “as miscellaneous receipts” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Amendments__ 

    1972—[Pub. L. 92–417][/us/pl/92/417] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), struck out requirement that the Secretary of the Army discharge his functions under the direction of the Secretary of Defense, and added subsec. (b).
