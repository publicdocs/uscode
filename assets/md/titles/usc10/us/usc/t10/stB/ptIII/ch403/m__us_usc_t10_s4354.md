## § 4354. Buildings and grounds: memorial hall; buildings for religious worship

    (a) The memorial hall at the Academy is a repository for statues, busts, mural tablets, portraits of distinguished and deceased officers and graduates of the Academy, paintings of battle scenes, trophies of war, and other objects that may tend to elevate the military profession. No object may be placed in this hall without the approval of two-thirds of the members of the Academic Board of the Academy by a recorded vote taken by ayes and nays.

    (b) The Secretary of the Army may authorize any denomination, sect, or religious body to erect a building for religious worship on the West Point Military Reservation, if its erection will not interfere with the use of the reservation for military purposes and will be without expense to the United States. Such a building shall be removed, or its location changed, without compensation for it and without other expense to the United States, by the denomination, sect, or religious body that erected it, whenever in the opinion of the Secretary public or military necessity so requires.
