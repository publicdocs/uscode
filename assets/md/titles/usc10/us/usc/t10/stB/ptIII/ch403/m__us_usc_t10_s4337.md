    The words “The chaplain may be reappointed” are substituted for the words “and said chaplain shall be eligible for reappointment for an additional term or terms”. The figures “$5,482.80” and “$6,714” are substituted for the figures “$4,000” and “$5,000” to reflect increases in the rates of salary of that office effected by the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, [59 Stat. 295][/us/stat/59/295], the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1946, [60 Stat. 216][/us/stat/60/216], the Postal Rate Revision and Federal Employees Salary Act of 1948, [62 Stat. 1260][/us/stat/62/1260], and the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 954][/us/stat/63/954].

 __1962__  __Act__ 

    The change reflects the opinion of the Assistant General Counsel, Civil Service Commission (GC: JHF:fz, May 4, 1959), that those parts of section 4337 and 9337 of title 10 that relate to the salaries of the chaplains at the United States Military Academy and the United States Air Force Academy were superseded by the Classification Act of 1949 ([5 U.S.C. 1071][/us/usc/t5/s1071] et seq.). While the positions of chaplain at those Academies are not specifically covered by the Act, the Act has been determined to apply to those positions in accordance with section 203 thereof ([5 U.S.C. 1083][/us/usc/t5/s1083]).

 __Amendments__ 

    2001—[Pub. L. 107–107][/us/pl/107/107] substituted “a monthly housing allowance in the same amount as the basic allowance for housing allowed to a lieutenant colonel” for “the same allowances for public quarters as are allowed to a captain”.

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–651][/us/pl/87/651] struck out provisions which prescribed the salary of chaplain on appointment and reappointment.

 __Effective Date of 2001 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 107–107, div. A, title V, § 540(b)][/us/pl/107/107/s540/b], Dec. 28, 2001, [115 Stat. 1109][/us/stat/115/1109], provided that: 

> “The amendment made by subsection (a) \[amending this section\] shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Dec. 28, 2001\].”

 __Delegation of Functions__ 

    Functions of President under this section delegated to Secretary of Defense, see section 1(5) of Ex. Ord. No. 11390, Jan. 22, 1968, 33 F.R. 841, set out as a note under [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], The President.
