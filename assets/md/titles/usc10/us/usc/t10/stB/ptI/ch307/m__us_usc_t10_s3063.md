    In subsection (b), the words “enumerated in this subsection” are omitted as surplusage. The word “hereafter” is omitted, since all wars and emergencies declared by Congress before June 29, 1950, have been terminated.

    In subsection (c), the words “and commissioned” are omitted as covered by the word “appointed”. The words “specified in subsection (b) of this section” are omitted as surplusage. The word “commissioned” is inserted before the word “officer”, for clarity.
