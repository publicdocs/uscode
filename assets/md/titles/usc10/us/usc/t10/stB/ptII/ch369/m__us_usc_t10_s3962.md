    In subsection (a), the words “who has served (1) as Chief of Staff to the President, (2) as Chief of Staff of the Army, (3) as a senior member of the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations, or (4) in a position of importance and responsibility designated by the President to carry the grade of general or lieutenant general under [section 3066 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s3066]” are substituted for the words “while serving in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) or (c) of this section”.

    In subsection (b), or 10:156c (1st 6, and 9th through 43d, words) is omitted as covered by 10:1026 (less 24 words before proviso, and less proviso), since the Medical Service Corps is a branch of the Army. The references to the Commanding General of the General Headquarters Air Force are omitted as executed.

    In subsection (c), 10:166g(b) (proviso) is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (d), the words “Upon retirement” are substituted for the words “When \* \* \* is retired”. The word “allowances” is omitted, since retired officers are not entitled to allowances. The words “grade is below brigadier general” are inserted, since any permanent professor who has the grade of brigadier general retires in that grade under [section 4335 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4335].

    [Pub. L. 96–343][/us/pl/96/343], § 13(a)(2), struck out “Regular” before “Army”.
