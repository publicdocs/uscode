    In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for 10:486a (last sentence). The words “rules and” and “from and after the date of the accrediting of said Academy” are omitted as surplusage. The word “conditions” is substituted for the words “rules and regulations”.

    In subsection (b), the words “except [section 541 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s541]” are inserted to reflect the authority to appoint graduates of one service academy as officers of another service.
