## § 4842. Settlement of accounts of line officers

    The Comptroller General shall settle the account of a line officer of the Army for pay due the officer even if the officer cannot account for property entrusted to the officer or cannot make a monthly report or return, when the Comptroller General is satisfied that the inability to account for property or make a report or return was the result of the officer having been a prisoner, or of an accident or casualty of war.

(Added [Pub. L. 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], § 2(b)(10)(B), Sept. 13, 1982, [96 Stat. 1057][/us/stat/96/1057].)

The words “for their services as such” and “by the affidavit of the officer or otherwise” are omitted as surplus. The words “to account for property or make a report or return” are added for clarity. The words “in the hands of the enemy” are omitted as surplus.
