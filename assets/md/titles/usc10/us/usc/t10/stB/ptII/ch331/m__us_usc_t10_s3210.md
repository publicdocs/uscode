## § 3210. Regular Army: strength in grade; general officers

    (a) Subject to [section 526 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s526], the authorized strength of the Regular Army in general officers on the active-duty list is 75/10,000 of the authorized strength of the Regular Army in commissioned officers on the active-duty list.

    (b)

     The authorized strength of each of the following branches—

        (1) each corps of the Army Medical Department; and

        (2) the Chaplains;

        in general officers on the active-duty list of the Regular Army is 5/1,000 of the authorized strength of the branch concerned in commissioned officers on the active-duty list of the Regular Army. Not more than one-half of the authorized strength in general officers in such a branch may be in a regular grade above brigadier general.

    (c) When the application of the percentages and ratios specified in this section results in a fraction, a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one, and a fraction of less than one-half is disregarded.

Under section 208(e) of the National Security Act of 1947 ([5 U.S.C. 626c(e)][/us/usc/t5/s626c/e]), allocations of those authorized strengths were made between the Army and the Air Force as follows:

After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61–1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.

    The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Army in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force and the addition of four general officer spaces in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps.

    That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of \[former\] subsection (c), below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.

    The word “regular” is substituted for the word “permanent” throughout the revised section.

    In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a Regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.

    In subsection (c)(1), the figures “12” and “6” result from the allocation of the original figures “16” and “8”.

    In subsection (c)(2), the figures “3” and “2” result from the allocation of the original figures “4” and “2”.

    In subsection (c)(3), the figure “1” results from the allocation of the original figure “1”. None was allocated to the Air Force.

    In subsection (c)(4), the figure “1” results from the allocation of the original figures “2” and “1”. (The major general was allocated to the Army, the brigadier general to the Air Force.)

    In subsection (c)(5), the figures “188” and “94” result from the allocation of the original figures “334” and “167”. The allocation of 188 corresponds to the allotment made by the Secretary of War between the Air Corps and the Army exclusive of the Air Corps, the Medical Department, and the Chaplains, under 10:506a(a) (3d proviso). That proviso is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (e), the words “by law to hold any civil office under the United States” are substituted for the words “by Acts of Congress to hold appointments in the Diplomatic or Consular Service of the Government or to hold any civil office under the Government”.
