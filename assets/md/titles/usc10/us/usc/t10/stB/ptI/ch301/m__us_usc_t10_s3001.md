    The words “Army of the United States” and “are synonymous and” are omitted as surplusage, since the term “Army” is used throughout the revised title. 5:181–3(a) (last sentence) and 10:1a(a) (last sentence) are omitted as surplusage.

 __Amendments__ 

    1987—[Pub. L. 100–26][/us/pl/100/26] inserted “the term” after “In this title,”.
