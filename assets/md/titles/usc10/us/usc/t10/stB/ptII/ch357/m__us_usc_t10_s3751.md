    (b) Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, any medal or other device issued under subsection (a) that is lost, destroyed, or becomes unfit for use, without fault or neglect of the owner, may be replaced at cost.

    In subsection (a), 10:1415a (proviso) is omitted as surplusage, since the revised section is not limited to persons who are members of the Army at the time of the issue.

    In subsection (b), the words “member of the Army or the Air Force” are substituted for the words “persons in the military service of the United States”.

    In subsection (c), the last 16 words are substituted for 10:1415c (last 16 words).
