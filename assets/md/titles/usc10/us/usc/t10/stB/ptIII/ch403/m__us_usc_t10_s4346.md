    (a) To be eligible for admission to the Academy a candidate must be at least 17 years of age and must not have passed his twenty-third birthday on July 1 of the year in which he enters the Academy.

    (b) To be admitted to the Academy, an appointee must show, by an examination held under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army, that he is qualified in the subjects prescribed by the Secretary.

    (c) A candidate designated as a principal or an alternate for appointment as a cadet shall appear for physical examination at a time and place designated by the Secretary.

    (d) To be admitted to the Academy, an appointee must take and subscribe to the following oath—    “I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States, and bear true allegiance to the National Government; that I will maintain and defend the sovereignty of the United States, paramount to any and all allegiance, sovereignty, or fealty I may owe to any State or country whatsoever; and that I will at all times obey the legal orders of my superior officers, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”

        If a candidate for admission refuses to take this oath, his appointment is terminated.

    In subsection (a), the words “Effective January 1, 1951” are omitted as executed. The word “Calendar” is omitted as surplusage. The words “must not have passed his twenty-second birthday” are substituted for the words “not more than twenty-two years of age”, to make it clear that a person whose twenty-second birthday falls on July 1 of the year of admission is eligible (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1952/7083, 2 Sept. 1952)).

    In subsection (b), the words “To be” are substituted for the words “before they shall be”. The words “must show \* \* \* that he is qualified” are substituted for the words “shall be required to be well versed”. The words “from time to time” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), the word “shall” is substituted for the word “may”, since the nominee is required to appear for the examination. The word “appear” is substituted for the words “present himself”. The words “at a place” are substituted for the words “at West Point, New York, or other prescribed places”.

    In subsection (d), the word “county” is omitted as surplusage. The words “Uniform Code of Military Justice” are substituted for the words “rules and articles governing the armies of the United States”, since the Articles of War have been superseded by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The words “his appointment is terminated” are substituted for the words “shall be dismissed from the service”, since a cadet who has not taken the oath is not yet a member.
