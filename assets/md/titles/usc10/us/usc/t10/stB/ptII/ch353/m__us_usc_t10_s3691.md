    10:291c (proviso) and the words “after June 30, 1948”, in 10:291c–1, are omitted as executed. The definition of the term “flying officer”, in 10:291c, originally was a definition of the term “flying officer in time of peace” as provided by [section 2 of the Act of July 2, 1926, ch. 721][/us/act/1926-07-02/ch721/s2], [44 Stat. 781][/us/stat/44/781]. [Section 1 of the Act of October 4, 1940, ch. 742][/us/act/1940-10-04/ch742/s1], [54 Stat. 963][/us/stat/54/963], eliminated the words “in time of peace”. As a consequence of that amendment, 10:291e (1st 26 words) is omitted as surplusage. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:291c–1 (less last 10 words). The words “commissioned officers or warrant”, in 10:291c–1, are omitted as surplusage. In clause (4), the last 12 words are substituted for the words “any other”.
