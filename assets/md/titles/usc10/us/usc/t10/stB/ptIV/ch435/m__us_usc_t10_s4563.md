## § 4563. Clothing: replacement when destroyed to prevent contagion

    Upon the recommendation of the Surgeon General, the Secretary of the Army may order a gratuitous issue of clothing to any enlisted member of the Army who has had a contagious disease, and to any hospital attendant who attended him while he had that disease, to replace clothing destroyed by order of an officer of the Medical Corps to prevent contagion.
