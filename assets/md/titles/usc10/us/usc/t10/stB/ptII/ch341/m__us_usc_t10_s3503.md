    The words “and shall be an extra number therein” are omitted, since, in the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAG 210.85, Feb. 21, 1923), they were repealed by the [Act of July 31, 1935, ch. 422][/us/act/1935-07-31/ch422], [49 Stat. 505][/us/stat/49/505]. The words “in the discretion of the President, employed \* \* \* assigned to duty” are omitted as surplusage. The word “branch” is substituted for the words “arms, corps, department” to conform to sections 3063 and 3064 of this title.
