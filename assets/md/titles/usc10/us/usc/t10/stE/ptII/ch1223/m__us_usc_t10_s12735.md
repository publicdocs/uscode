    In subsection (a), the words “would be eligible but for the fact that he is under 60 years of age” are substituted for the words “has not attained the age of sixty years but is eligible in all other respects”. The words “for members of his armed force, other than members of a regular component” are substituted for the words “for the reserve components of the Army of the United States or Air Force of the United States”, since the source statute applied to all members except members of the regular components. The words “as has been, or” and “by law or regulation” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b), the words “after the effective date of such transfer” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), 10:1036g (last 32 words of last sentence) and 34:440o (last 32 words of last sentence) are omitted as surplusage.
