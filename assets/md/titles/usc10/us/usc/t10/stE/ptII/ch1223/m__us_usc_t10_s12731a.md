    (a)  __Retirement With At Least__  __15__  __Years of Service__  __.—__ 

    For the purposes of [section 12731 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s12731], the Secretary concerned may—

        (1)

         during the period described in subsection (b), determine to treat a member of the Selected Reserve of a reserve component of the armed force under the jurisdiction of that Secretary as having met the service requirements of subsection (a)(2) of that section and provide the member with the notification required by subsection (d) of that section if the member—

            (A) as of October 1, 1991, has completed at least 15, and less than 20, years of service computed under [section 12732 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s12732]; or

            (B) after that date and before the end of the period described in subsection (b), completes 15 years of service computed under that section; and

        (2) upon the request of the member submitted to the Secretary, transfer the member to the Retired Reserve.

    (b)  __Period of Authority__  __.—__ 

    The period referred to in subsection (a)(1) is the period beginning on October 23, 1992, and ending on December 31, 2001.

    (c)  __Applicability Subject to Needs of the Service__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary concerned may limit the applicability of subsection (a) to any category of personnel defined by the Secretary in order to meet a need of the armed force under the jurisdiction of the Secretary to reduce the number of members in certain grades, the number of members who have completed a certain number of years of service, or the number of members who possess certain military skills or are serving in designated competitive categories.

        (2) A limitation under paragraph (1) shall be consistent with the purpose set forth in section 4414(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 ([Public Law 102–484][/us/pl/102/484]; [106 Stat. 2713][/us/stat/106/2713]).

Such notification may not be made if the disability is the result of the member’s intentional misconduct, willful neglect, or willful failure to comply with standards and qualifications for retention established by the Secretary concerned or was incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.

    (d)  __Exclusion__  __.—__ 

    This section does not apply to persons referred to in [section 12731(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s12731/c].
