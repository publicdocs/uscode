## § 12214. Officers; Air Force Reserve: transfer from Air National Guard of the United States

    (a) Under such regulations as the Secretary of the Air Force may prescribe, and with the consent of the governor or other appropriate authority of the State concerned, an officer of the Air National Guard of the United States may be transferred in grade to the Air Force Reserve.

    (b) Unless discharged from his appointment as a Reserve, an officer of the Air National Guard of the United States whose Federal recognition as a member of the Air National Guard is withdrawn becomes a member of the Air Force Reserve. An officer who so becomes a member of the Air Force Reserve ceases to be a member of the Air National Guard of the United States.

    In subsection (a), the words “at any time”, “of any person”, and “from the National Guard of the United States or from the Air National Guard of the United States” are omitted as surplusage. The words “highest regular or reserve grade ever held by him in the Air Force” are substituted for the words “highest permanent grade previously held in \* \* \* the Air Force or any component thereof”, since “permanent” grades are held only in a component and there are no “nonpermanent” grades held in a component.

    In subsection (b), the words “appointment as a Reserve” are substituted for the words “appointment or \* \* \* as a Reserve officer or”. The words “whose Federal recognition as a member \* \* \* is withdrawn” are substituted for the words “ceases to hold a status as a federally recognized member”.
