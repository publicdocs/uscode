    (b) __Service Credit.—__ 

    A member ordered to funeral honors duty under this section shall be required to perform a minimum of two hours of such duty in order to receive—

        (2)

         as directed by the Secretary concerned, either—

            (A) the allowance under [section 495 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s495]; or

            (B) compensation under [section 206 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s206].

    (c) __Reimbursable Expenses.—__ 

    A member who performs funeral honors duty under this section may be reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses incurred in conjunction with such duty as authorized under chapter 7 of title 37 if such duty is performed at a location 50 miles or more from the member’s residence.

    (d) __Regulations.—__ 

    The exercise of authority under subsection (a) is subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.

    (e) __Members of the National Guard.—__ 

    This section does not apply to members of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States. The performance of funeral honors duty by those members is provided for in [section 115 of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s115].
