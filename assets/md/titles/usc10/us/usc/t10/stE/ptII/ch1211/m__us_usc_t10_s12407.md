## § 12407. National Guard in Federal service: period of service; apportionment

    (a) Whenever the President calls the National Guard of a State into Federal service, he may specify in the call the period of the service.

    (b) When the National Guard of a State is called into Federal service with the National Guard of another State, the President may apportion the total number called from the Army National Guard or from the Air National Guard, as the case may be, on the basis of the populations of the States affected by the call.
