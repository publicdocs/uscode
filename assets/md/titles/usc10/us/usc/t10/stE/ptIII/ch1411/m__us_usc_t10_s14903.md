    (c)  __Recommendations to Secretary__  __.—__ 

    If a board of inquiry determines that the officer has failed to establish that the officer should be retained in an active status, the board shall recommend to the Secretary concerned that the officer not be retained in an active status.

    (d)  __Action by Secretary__  __.—__ 

    After review of the recommendation of the board of inquiry, the Secretary may—

        (1) remove the officer from an active status; or

    (e)  __Action in Cases Where Cause for Retention Is Established__  __.—__ 

        (1) If a board of inquiry determines that an officer has established that the officer should be retained in an active status or if the Secretary determines that the case be closed, the officer’s case is closed.

        (2) An officer who is required to show cause for retention under [section 14902(a) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s14902/a] and whose case is closed under paragraph (1) may not again be required to show cause for retention under such subsection during the one-year period beginning on the date of that determination.

        (3)

            (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an officer who is required to show cause for retention under [section 14902(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s14902/b] and whose case is closed under paragraph (1) may again be required to show cause for retention at any time.

            (B) An officer who has been required to show cause for retention under [section 14902(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s14902/b] and who is thereafter retained in an active status may not again be required to show cause for retention under such section solely because of conduct which was the subject of the previous proceeding, unless the recommendations of the board of inquiry that considered the officer’s case are determined to have been obtained by fraud or collusion.
