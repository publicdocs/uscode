    The word “commissioned” is inserted, since the retirement of warrant officers for length of service is covered by [section 1293 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1293]. The word “regular” is inserted, since 10:943 is applicable historically only to officers of a regular component. The words “and placed on the retired list” are omitted as surplusage. The words “computed under [section 8926 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s8926]” are inserted for clarity.

 __Delegation of Functions__ 

    Functions of President under this section to approve request of a regular commissioned officer of Air Force to retire after at least 30 years of service delegated to Secretary of Defense to perform, without approval, ratification, or other action by President, and with authority for Secretary to redelegate, see Ex. Ord. No. 12396, §§ 1(f), 3, Dec. 9, 1982, 47 F.R. 55897, 55898, set out as a note under [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], The President.
