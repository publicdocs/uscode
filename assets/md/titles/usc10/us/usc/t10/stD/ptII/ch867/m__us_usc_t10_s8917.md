The word “regular” is inserted to conform to an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/2301, 23 Mar. 1953). The words “upon his request” are substituted for the words “upon making application to the President”, in 10:947, and “by application to the President”, in 10:947a. The words “either as a private or non-commissioned officer, or both”, in 10:947a, are omitted as surplusage. The words “shall be retired” are substituted for the words “be placed upon the retired list”, in 10:947, and “be placed on the retired list heretofore created”, in 10:947a. The words “computed under [section 8925 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s8925]” are inserted for clarity. The 21 words before the proviso and the proviso of the Act of February 14, 1885, as restated, are not contained in 10:947a. They are also omitted from the revised section, since the proviso is executed and the 21 words before the proviso are omitted as covered by formula E of [section 8991 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s8991].
