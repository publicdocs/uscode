## § 9352. Cadets: hazing

    (a)

     Subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Air Force, the Superintendent of the Academy shall issue regulations—

        (1) defining hazing;

        (2) designed to prevent that practice; and

        (3) prescribing dismissal, suspension, or other adequate punishment for violations.

    (b) If a cadet who is charged with violating a regulation issued under subsection (a), the penalty for which is or may be dismissal from the Academy, requests in writing a trial by a general court-martial, he may not be dismissed for that offense except under sentence of such a court.

    (c) A cadet dismissed from the Academy for hazing may not be reappointed as an Air Force cadet, and is ineligible for appointment as a commissioned officer in a regular component of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, until two years after the graduation of his class.

    In subsection (a), the word “violations” is substituted for the words “infractions of the same”. The words “to embody a clear” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b), the words “the penalty for which is or may be” are substituted for the words “which would involve”. The words “may not be dismissed for that offense except under sentence of such a court” are substituted for the words “shall be granted”.

    In subsection (c), the words “a regular component” are inserted, since the source statute historically applied only to the regular components.
