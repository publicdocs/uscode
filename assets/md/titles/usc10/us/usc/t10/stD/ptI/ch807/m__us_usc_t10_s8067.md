    The references in clauses (4), (6), and (7) of 10:1837(a) are omitted, since the laws to which reference is made deal with qualifications for appointment as commissioned officers and do not specify professional qualifications prerequisite to designation to duties requiring special training or experience. The reference in clause (8) is omitted as executed.

    10:1837(b) and (c) are omitted, since, except in the case of a reference to a law not presently in effect, their substance is covered by including the laws referred to in various revised sections of this title (see the distribution tables). 10:81–2 (less 1st and last provisos) is omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsections (a)–(d), (g), and (h), the words “commissioned officers” are substituted for the word “members”, in 10:1837(a), since, under the laws to which reference is made, only commissioned officers may be designated to perform these functions.

    In subsections (e) and (f), the words “female commissioned officers” are substituted for the word “members”, in 10:1837(a), since, under the laws to which reference is made, only female commissioned officers may be designated to perform these functions.
