The words “subject to such regulations as he may prescribe” are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words “to any of the ‘National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers’ already established or hereafter established and”, in the [Act of February 8, 1889, ch. 116][/us/act/1889-02-08/ch116], [25 Stat. 657][/us/stat/25/657], are not contained in 50:66 (2d sentence). They are also omitted from the revised section, since the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were dissolved by the [Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863][/us/act/1930-07-03/ch863], [46 Stat. 1016][/us/stat/46/1016]. The Acts of [March 3, 1899, ch. 643][/us/act/1899-03-03/ch643] (1st proviso under “Ordnance Department”), [30 Stat. 1073][/us/stat/30/1073]; and [May 26, 1900, ch. 586][/us/act/1900-05-26/ch586] (1st proviso under “Ordnance Department”), [31 Stat. 216][/us/stat/31/216], as amended, relating to disposal of ordnance to “Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers” by the Chief of Ordnance of the Army, became inoperative when the Homes were dissolved. Although section 402(e) of the Army Organization Act of 1950, ch. 383, [64 Stat. 273][/us/stat/64/273], amended the Act of May 26, 1900, it did not have the effect of reviving that act. The word “give” is substituted for the word “deliver” to express more clearly the intent of the section. The words “serviceable” and “as may be on hand undisposed of” are omitted as surplusage. The word “may” is substituted for the words “is authorized and directed”, since [section 9684 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s9684] provides an alternative method for the disposal of obsolete cannon.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—[Pub. L. 107–217][/us/pl/107/217] substituted “[section 121 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s121]” for “section 205 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 ([40 U.S.C. 486][/us/usc/t40/s486])”.

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “section 205 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 ([40 U.S.C. 486][/us/usc/t40/s486])” for “[section 486 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s486]”.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Dec. 12, 1980, see [section 701(b)(3) of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701/b/3], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
