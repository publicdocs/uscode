    The words “at cost prices” are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended ([63 Stat. 585][/us/stat/63/585]), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)
