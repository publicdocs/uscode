         Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the transportation of passengers or property by CRAF-eligible aircraft in interstate air transportation obtained by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a military department through a contract for airlift service in the United States may be provided only by an air carrier that—

            (A) has aircraft in the civil reserve air fleet or offers to place the aircraft in that fleet; and

            (B) holds a certificate issued under [section 41102 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s41102].

        (2) The Secretary of Transportation shall act as expeditiously as possible on an application for a certificate under [section 41102 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s41102] to provide airlift service.

    (b)  __Transportation Between the United States and Foreign Locations__  __.—__
