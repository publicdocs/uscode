## § 8924. Forty years or more: Air Force officers

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 552][/us/stat/70A/552]; [Pub. L. 96–513, title V, § 504(18)][/us/pl/96/513/s504/18], Dec. 12, 1980, [94 Stat. 2917][/us/stat/94/2917].)

    In subsection (a), the words “Except as provided in [section 8786 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s8786]” are inserted, since, under that revised section, when board proceedings are pending against a commissioned officer, his right to retire under this revised section, which is otherwise absolute, is discretionary with the Secretary under that revised section.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the words “or volunteer service, or both” are omitted as obsolete in accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General, 22 Ops. Atty. Gen. 199, Aug. 30, 1898, holding that such words refer to volunteer service in the Civil War. The words “upon his request” are substituted for the words “if he make application therefor to the President”.

    In subsection (b), the applicability of 10:942 to warrant officers is based on an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1950/6951, 4 Jan. 1951), which holds that 10:594 (less provisos) makes 10:942 applicable to warrant officers.

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “section 1186” for “section 8786”.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Sept. 15, 1981, see [section 701 of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
