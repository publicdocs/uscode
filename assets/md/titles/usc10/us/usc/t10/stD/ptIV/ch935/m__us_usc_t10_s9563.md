## § 9563. Clothing: replacement when destroyed to prevent contagion

    The Secretary of the Air Force may order a gratuitous issue of clothing to any enlisted member of the Air Force who has had a contagious disease, and to any hospital attendant who attended him while he had that disease, to replace clothing destroyed by order of a medical officer to prevent contagion.

    The words “enlisted member” are substituted for the word “soldiers”. The words “any articles of their” are omitted as surplusage. The words “while he had that disease” are inserted for clarity. The words “a medical officer” are substituted for the words “proper medical officers”. The words “on the recommendation of the Surgeon General” are omitted, since the Air Force does not have the statutory office of Surgeon General, and functions which, for the Army, are assigned by statute to subordinate officers of the Army are, for the Air Force, assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force.
