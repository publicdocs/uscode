## § 9561. Rations

    (a) The President may prescribe the components, and the quantities thereof, of the Air Force ration. He may direct the issue of equivalent articles in place of the prescribed components whenever, in his opinion, economy and the health and comfort of the members of the Air Force so require.

    (b) An enlisted member of the Air Force on active duty is entitled to one ration daily. The emergency ration, when issued, is in addition to the regular ration.

    (c) Fresh or preserved fruits, milk, butter, and eggs necessary for the proper diet of the sick in hospitals shall be provided under regulations approved by the Secretary.

    In subsection (a), the words “the components, and the quantities thereof” are substituted for the words “the kinds and quantities of the component articles”. The words “substitutive” and “a due regard” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b), the words “on active duty” are inserted for clarity. The words “under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Army”, in 10:725, are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words “or reserve”, “prescribed for use on emergent occasions”, and “furnished”, in 10:725, are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), the words “as the Surgeon General” are omitted, since the Air Force does not have the statutory office of Surgeon General, and functions which, for the Army, are assigned by statute to subordinate officers of the Army are, for the Air Force, assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force. The words “Such quantities of” and “may be allowed” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Delegation of Authority__ 

    Authority of President under subsec. (a) of this section to prescribe uniform military ration applicable to Air Force delegated to Secretary of Defense by section 3(a) of Ex. Ord. No. 12781, Nov. 20, 1991, 56 F.R. 59203, set out as a note under [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], The President.
