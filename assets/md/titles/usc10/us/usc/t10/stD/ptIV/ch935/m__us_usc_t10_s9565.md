## § 9565. Colors, standards, and guidons of demobilized organizations: disposition

    (a)

     The Secretary of the Air Force may dispose of colors, standards, and guidons of demobilized organizations of the Air Force, as follows:

        (1) Those brought into Federal service by the Air National Guard of a State may be returned to that State upon the request of its governor.

        (2) Those that cannot be returned under clause (1) may, upon the request of its governor, be sent to the State that, as determined by the Secretary, furnished the majority of members of the organization when it was formed.

        Those that cannot be returned or sent under clause (1) or (2) of this subsection shall be delivered to the Secretary, for such national use as he may direct.

    (b) Title to colors, standards, and guidons of demobilized organizations of the Air Force remains in the United States.

    (c) No color, standard, or guidon may be disposed of under this section unless provision satisfactory to the Secretary has been made for its preservation and care.

    In subsection (a), the words “Any which were used during their service by such organizations and” are omitted as surplusage. The first 15 words of the last sentence are substituted for 5:202 (1st 45 words of 2d sentence). The words “the Quartermaster General” are omitted, since the functions which, for the Army, are assigned by statute to subordinate officers of the Army, are, for the Air Force, assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force.
