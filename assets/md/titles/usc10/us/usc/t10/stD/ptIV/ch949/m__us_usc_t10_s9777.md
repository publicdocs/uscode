    The words “may permit” are substituted for the words “shall have authority, in his discretion, to permit”. The words “to permit the extension of State, county, and Territorial roads across military reservations” are omitted as superseded by [section 2668 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2668]. In clause (3), the word “livestock” is substituted for the words “cattle, sheep or other stock animals”.
