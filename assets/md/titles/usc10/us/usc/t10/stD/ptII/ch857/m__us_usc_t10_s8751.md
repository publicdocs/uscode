## § 8751. Service medals: issue; replacement; availability of appropriations

    (a) The Secretary of the Air Force shall procure, and issue without charge to any person entitled thereto, any service medal authorized for members of the Air Force after September 26, 1947, and any ribbon, clasp, star, or similar device prescribed as a part of that medal.

    (b) Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, any medal or other device issued under subsection (a) that is lost, destroyed, or becomes unfit for use without fault or neglect of the owner, may be replaced at cost. However, if the owner is a member of the Air Force, the medal or device may be replaced without charge.

    (c) The Secretary may spend, from any appropriation for the support of the Air Force, amounts necessary to provide medals and devices under this section.

In subsection (a), the words “authorized for members of the Air Force after September 26, 1947” are substituted for the words “hereafter authorized”, since, under Transfer Order 1, that date was the effective date of the transfer of personnel from the Army to the Air Force under section 208(e) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended ([5 U.S.C. 626c(e)][/us/usc/t5/s626c/e]). 10:1415a (proviso) is omitted as surplusage, since the revised section is not limited to persons who are members of the Air Force at the time of the issue.

    In subsection (b), the words “member of the Air Force” are substituted for the words “persons in the military service of the United States”.

    In subsection (c), the last 16 words are substituted for 10:1415c (last 16 words).
