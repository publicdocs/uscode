## § 9336. Permanent professors; director of admissions

    (a) A permanent professor of the Academy who is the head of a department of instruction, or who has served as such a professor for more than six years, has the grade of colonel. However, a permanent professor appointed from the Regular Air Force has the grade of colonel after the date when he completes six years of service as a professor, or after the date on which he would have been promoted had he been selected for promotion from among officers in the promotion zone, whichever is earlier. All other permanent professors have the grade of lieutenant colonel.

    (b) A person appointed as director of admissions of the Academy has the regular grade of lieutenant colonel, and, after he has served six years as director of admissions, has the regular grade of colonel. However, a person appointed from the Regular Air Force has the regular grade of colonel after the date when he completes six years of service as director of admissions, or after the date on which he would have been promoted had he been selected for promotion from among officers in the promotion zone, whichever is earlier.

    The word “grade” is substituted for the word “rank”. The words “pay, and allowances” are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. 10:1079a(a) (last proviso), and the words “Hereafter each of”, “who have been or may hereafter be”, and “and appointed in” are omitted as surplusage.

 __1958__  __Act__ 

    The word “regular” is deleted \[in sections 9335 and 9336\] to make clear that a Dean or professor of the United States Air Force Academy holds only the office of “Dean” or “professor” and not the office of “brigadier general” or “colonel”, as the case may be, even though he is entitled to the pay and allowances of that grade.
