    In subsection (a) the words “appropriated funds” are substituted for the words “naval appropriations”, and the definition of “naval personnel” in [5 U.S.C. 421g][/us/usc/t5/s421g], which is applicable to this section, is executed. In executing this definition the words “while on active duty” are omitted as unnecessary, since a member not on active duty would not have an official station within the meaning of this section.

    1980—Subsec. (a)(3). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration” for “Environmental Science Services Administration”.
