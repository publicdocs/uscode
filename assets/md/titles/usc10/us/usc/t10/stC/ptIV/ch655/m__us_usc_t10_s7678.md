## § 7678. Interfering with delivery, custody, or sale of prize property

    Whoever willfully does, or aids or advises in the doing of, any act relating to the bringing in, custody, preservation, sale, or other disposition of any property captured as prize, or relating to any documents or papers connected with the property or to any deposition or other document or paper connected with the proceedings, with intent to defraud, delay, or injure the United States or any claimant of that property, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 482][/us/stat/70A/482].)

    The words “captor or” between “any” and “claimant” are omitted because the [Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413][/us/act/1899-03-03/ch413], § 13, [30 Stat. 1007][/us/stat/30/1007], repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize proceeds to captors. These words were apparently carried over inadvertently to § 38 of the 1909 Act from the source of that section, namely R.S. 5441.

    The section is worded in the style of Title 18, U.S. Code.
