    In subsection (a) the words “or all” are omitted as surplusage. The words “under this chapter” are substituted for the words “of lands within the naval petroleum reserves or other naval fuel reserves under the authority of this section” for brevity. The words “be delivered to the United States, or shall be paid for in money” are substituted for the words “be paid for in money or be paid in kind” for clarity. Neither gas, oil, gasoline, nor hydrocarbon can be “paid”, but any one of them may be delivered.

    In subsection (b) the words “except as otherwise provided in this section” are omitted as surplusage. There is no exception within the chapter to the rule stated in subsection (b). The word “paid” is substituted for the words “which may accrue” for clarity. The words “under this chapter” are substituted for the words “under the provisions of this section or of sections \* \* \* on account of the petroleum products extracted therefrom” for brevity. The two terms are coextensive. The sections of 30 U.S.C. that are cited in [34 U.S.C. 524][/us/usc/t34/s524] (10th par.) comprise the entire [Act of Feb. 25, 1920, ch. 85][/us/act/1920-02-25/ch85], [41 Stat. 437][/us/stat/41/437], as amended. The application of that Act to the Navy is covered in [§ 7427 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s7427]. The words “as miscellaneous receipts” are omitted as surplusage.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 94–258, § 201(15)][/us/pl/94/258/s201/15], struck out “and oil shale” after “petroleum”.

    1962—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 87–796][/us/pl/87/796] substituted “or other substance” for “or other hydrocarbon substance”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 87–796][/us/pl/87/796] substituted “All money accruing to the United States from lands in the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves” for “Money paid to the United States for petroleum products under this chapter”.
