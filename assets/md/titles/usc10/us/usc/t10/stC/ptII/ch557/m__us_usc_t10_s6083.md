## § 6083. Fixing cost on certain vessels and stations

    If the Secretary of the Navy considers that it is undesirable to administer the mess on any ship or at any station under the quantity allowance prescribed in [section 6082 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s6082], he may fix the cost of each ration for that mess.

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 380][/us/stat/70A/380].)

    The words “the cost of each ration for that mess” are substituted for the words “the monetary limit of the cost of ration aboard such ships and at such stations” to make it clear that the figure fixed by the Secretary of the Navy under this section is the amount the mess may spend per day for food for each man subsisting at the mess.
