    The words “for the proper instruction of naval personnel” and the words “be paid out of naval appropriations” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c) the words “except the authority to prescribe regulations” are omitted, since [34 U.S.C. 1071][/us/usc/t34/s1071] contains no authority for the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe regulations for the administration of that section.

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—Subsecs. (c), (d). [Pub. L. 106–65][/us/pl/106/65] added subsec. (c) and redesignated former subsec. (c) as (d).
