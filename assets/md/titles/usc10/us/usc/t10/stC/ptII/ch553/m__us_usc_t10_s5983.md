>     In determining the amounts to be requested for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2013 for the Marine Corps Security Guard Program and for additional personnel under the Program, the President shall ensure that amounts requested for the Marine Corps for that fiscal year do not degrade the readiness of the Marine Corps to fulfill the requirements of the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

>     “(e) __Reporting Requirements.—__ 

>         “(1) __Mission assessment.—__ 

>         Not later than October 1, 2013, the Secretary of Defense shall—

>             “(A) notify Congress of such modification and the change in the nature of threats prompting such modification; and
