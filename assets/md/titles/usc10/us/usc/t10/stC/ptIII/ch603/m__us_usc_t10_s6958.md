    In subsection (a) the effective date is omitted as executed. The words “at least 17 years of age and must not have passed his twenty-second birthday” are substituted for the words “not less than seventeen years of age and not more than twenty-two years of age” to remove ambiguity, and for uniformity of treatment of provisions of this type. The reference to time of examination is omitted as being included within the Secretary’s authority to prescribe regulations, which is stated in the subsection. The words “Academic Board” are substituted for the words “board of examiners”.

    In subsection (b) the words “domiciled in” are substituted for the words “actual resident of” since this term has been so interpreted.
