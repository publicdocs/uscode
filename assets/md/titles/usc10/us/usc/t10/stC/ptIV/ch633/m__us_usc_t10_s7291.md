>         “(3) If the Secretary determines that a vessel previously chartered under the program no longer has commercial utility, the Secretary may transfer the vessel to the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

>         “(4) A contract for the charter of a vessel under paragraph (1) shall include a provision that the charter may be terminated for national security reasons without cost to the United States.

>     “(d) __Reports To Congress.—__ 

>         (1) Not later than six months after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Nov. 5, 1990\], the Secretary of the Navy shall submit to Congress a report describing the Secretary’s plan for implementing the fast sealift program authorized by this section.
