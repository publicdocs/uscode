    The words “of the Naval Academy” following “Postgraduate School” are dropped as a result of [§ 4 of the Act of July 31, 1947][/us/act/1947-07-31/s4] (supra). This Act created the Postgraduate School and in effect transferred the position of Academic Dean of the Postgraduate School of the Naval Academy to the newly created Postgraduate School.
