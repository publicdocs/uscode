    In subsection (b) the words “except the authority to prescribe regulations” are omitted, since [5 U.S.C. 421d][/us/usc/t5/s421d] contains no authority for the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe regulations for the administration of that section.

(A) to (D) as (1) to (4), respectively, substituted “the activity.” for “the activity; and”, and struck out par. (2), which provided for transportation between the schools and the activity when the schools are not accessible by regular means of transportation.
