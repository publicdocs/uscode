    The words “or the reserve components thereof” are omitted because “Army”, “Navy”, and “Air Force”, as defined in this title, include the reserve components.

 __Amendments__ 

    1967—[Pub. L. 90–130][/us/pl/90/130] substituted provision reciting simply that service as a nurse in the armed forces before April 16, 1947, is considered as commissioned service for purposes of this chapter for provisions making specific reference to service under an appointment or contract or as a commissioned officer in the Nurse Corps of the Army or the Navy or as a commissioned officer of the Air Force designated as an Air Force Nurse.

    1966—[Pub. L. 89–609][/us/pl/89/609] substituted “the person’s” for “her” in introductory text in two places.

    1959—[Pub. L. 86–197][/us/pl/86/197] substituted “a regular officer or a reserve officer” for “an officer”.

 __Authority of Military Department Secretaries To Convene Boards To Recommend Deferment of Retirement or Separation of Nurses__ 

    Secretaries authorized until July 1, 1972, to convene boards of officers to consider and recommend deferment of separation or retirement of officers of the Army Nurse Corps, officers of the Navy Nurse Corps, and Air Force nurses, as needs of the service require, see [section 4(f) of Pub. L. 90–130][/us/pl/90/130/s4/f], set out as a note under [section 3069 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s3069].
