    In subsection (a) the words “vessel in the naval service” are substituted for the words “vessels of the Navy or in the naval service”. The defined term is used throughout the chapter, and by definition includes vessels of the Navy. The words “when the Coast Guard is operating as a service in the Navy” are substituted for the words “the Coast Guard when operating as a part of the Navy” to conform to the terminology of [14 U.S.C. 3][/us/usc/t14/s3].

    Subsection (b) is inserted for clarity, and is based on the source laws for this revised chapter.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
