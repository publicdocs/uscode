## § 7601. Sales: members of the naval service and Coast Guard; widows and widowers; civilian employees and other persons

    (a) Such stores as the Secretary of the Navy designates may be procured and sold to members of the naval service, members of the Coast Guard, and widows and widowers of such members.

    (b)

     The Secretary may, by regulation, provide for the procurement and sale of stores designated by him to such civilian officers and employees of the United States, and such other persons, as he considers proper—

        (1) at military installations outside the United States; and

        (2) at military installations inside the United States where he determines that it is impracticable for those civilian officers, employees, and persons to obtain those stores from private agencies without impairing the efficient operation of naval activities.

        However, sales to civilian officers and employees inside the United States may be made only to those residing within military installations.

    In subsection (a) the words “members of the naval service” are substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men of the Navy, Marine Corps”.

    In subsection (b) the word “outside” is substituted for the words “beyond the continental limitations”. The words “or in Alaska” are omitted, since, in [section 101(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/1], the words, “United States” are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word “continental”, after the words “within the”, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for [34 U.S.C. 533a][/us/usc/t34/s533a] (proviso).

    1985—[Pub. L. 99–145, § 1301(c)(3)(B)][/us/pl/99/145/s1301/c/3/B], inserted “the” before “naval service” and “and widowers” after “widows” in section catchline.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
