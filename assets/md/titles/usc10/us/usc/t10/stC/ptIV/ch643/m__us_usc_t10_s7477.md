## § 7477. Transportation of dependents and household effects of civilian personnel stationed outside the United States: payment in lieu of transportation

    (a)

     When civilian employees of the Department of the Navy are located at duty stations outside the United States, the dependents and household effects of such personnel may be transported—

        (1) from the locations outside the United States to locations designated by such personnel or their dependents; and

        (2) from those designated locations to the duty stations to which the personnel are ordered.

        The Secretary of the Navy may determine the civilian employees whose dependents and household effects may be transported under this section.

    (b) Authority to transport household effects under this section includes authority to pack and unpack those effects.

    (c) Transportation of dependents and household effects is authorized under this section either before or after orders are issued relieving the civilian concerned from the duty station outside the United States. The transportation may be by Government or commercial facilities.

    (d) In place of the transportation in kind authorized for dependents, the Secretary may authorize the payment, after the travel has been completed, of an amount equal to the commercial transportation costs, including taxes if paid, of all parts of the travel for which transportation in kind was not furnished.

    (e) Current appropriations available for travel and transportation may be used for expenditures under this section.
