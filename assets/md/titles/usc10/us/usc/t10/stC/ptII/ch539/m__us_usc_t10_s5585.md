    The words “from other persons” are substituted for the words “from civil life” because [34 U.S.C. 1020e][/us/usc/t34/s1020e] authorizes the appointment of graduates of the NROTC program as well as of other persons in civil life. Such graduates are, properly, persons in “civil life”, since they are members of the Naval Reserve who are not on active duty. However, since the status of members of the NROTC is not always clear, the statement of the class is expanded.

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “active-duty list” for “active list”.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Sept. 15, 1981, see [section 701 of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
