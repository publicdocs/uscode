## § 6246. Navy and Marine Corps Medal

    (a)

     The President may award a medal called the “Navy and Marine Corps Medal” of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon, together with a rosette or other device to be worn in place thereof—

        (1) to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy or the Marine Corps, distinguishes himself by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy; or

        (2) to any person to whom the Secretary of the Navy, before August 7, 1942, awarded a letter of commendation for heroism, and who applies for that medal, regardless of the date of the act of heroism.

    (b) The authority in subsection (a) includes authority to award the medal to a member of the Ready Reserve who was not in a duty status defined in [section 101(d) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/d] when the member distinguished himself by heroism.

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 390][/us/stat/70A/390]; [Pub. L. 105–85, div. A, title V][/us/pl/105/85/dA/tV], § 574(b), Nov. 18, 1997, [111 Stat. 1758][/us/stat/111/1758].)

    The word “award” is substituted for the word “present” to cover the determination of the recipient as well as the actual presenting of the award. The words “but not in the name of Congress” are omitted since a decoration is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The words “including the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve” are omitted as covered by the definitions of the Navy and the Marine Corps. The last sentence, relating to additional pay, is omitted for the reason that, under the Career Compensation Act of 1949 ([37 U.S.C. 231][/us/usc/t37/s231] et seq.), there is no additional pay authorized for any medal. The words “since December 6, 1941” are omitted as executed. The words “or herself” are omitted as covered by the rules of construction in [1 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t1/s1].

 __Amendments__ 

    1997—[Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b).
