    In subsection (a) the words “Regular” and “holding a permanent appointment in the grade of warrant officer, W–1, or above” are inserted for clarity. The words “after completing 30 or more years of active service” are substituted for the words “has been thirty years in the service” for clarity. The words “retired from active service” are omitted as surplusage.

    Subsection (b) is added to clarify the word “service”. It has been consistently interpreted to include active service in the armed forces as defined in this title.

    In subsection (c) the words “is entitled to retired pay at the rate of 75 percent of the highest basic pay of the grade in which retired” are substituted for the words “with three-fourths of the highest pay of his grade” for clarity and uniformity of expression.

    1980—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “September 8, 1980” for “the date of the enactment of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981” wherever appearing.

    [Pub. L. 96–342][/us/pl/96/342] designated existing provisions as par. (1), inserted provision limiting applicability to officers who became members of the uniformed services before the date of the enactment of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981, and added par. (2).
