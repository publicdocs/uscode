        (1) has been absent without authority for at least three months; or

    This section reflects the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy (JAG:I:2:ERS:cmr, dtd. 13 April 1954) that [50 U.S.C. 739][/us/usc/t50/s739] applies to warrant officers (now warrant officers, W–1), of the Navy and the Marine Corps. The Warrant Officer Act of 1954 established the grade of warrant officer, W–1, in lieu of the former warrant officer (as distinguished from commissioned warrant officer) grades. [50 U.S.C. 739][/us/usc/t50/s739], as applicable to officers above the grade of warrant officer, W–1, is codified in [§ 1161 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1161].

    In subsection (a) the words “by sentence of a general court-martial, or in commutation thereof” are omitted since the separation from the service of a warrant officer, W–1, by sentence of court-martial is effected by dishonorable discharge.

    In subsection (b) the words “from his place of duty” are omitted as surplusage. The words “at least” are substituted for the words “or more”. The words “by a court other than a court-martial or other military court” are substituted for the words “by the civil authorities”.
