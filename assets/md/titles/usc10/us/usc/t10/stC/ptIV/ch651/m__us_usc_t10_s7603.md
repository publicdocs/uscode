    The word “separated” is substituted for the word “discharged”. The words “under honorable conditions” are added since this provision is interpreted as benefiting personnel discharged under honorable conditions. The words “Air Force” are supplied under the authority of § 305(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended ([5 U.S.C. 171][/us/usc/t5/s171]l). The words “Veterans’ Administration” are added under the authority of the [Act of August 9, 1921, ch. 57][/us/act/1921-08-09/ch57], [42 Stat. 148][/us/stat/42/148], which transferred care of veterans to the Veterans’ Bureau, the [Act of June 7, 1924, ch. 320][/us/act/1924-06-07/ch320], [43 Stat. 610][/us/stat/43/610], which transferred all hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Public Health Service to the Veterans’ Bureau, and the [Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863, § 1][/us/act/1930-07-03/ch863/s1], [46 Stat. 1016][/us/stat/46/1016], under which the President by Executive Order No. 5398, July 21, 1930, transferred the Veterans’ Bureau to the Veterans’ Administration. The words “while undergoing such care and treatment” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Amendments__ 

    1989—[Pub. L. 101–189][/us/pl/101/189] substituted “Department of Veterans Affairs” for “Veterans’ Administration”.
