    The words “officers and midshipmen of the naval service” are substituted for the words “any officer of the Navy or any officer of the Marine Corps” and “any midshipman”. The words “at the Naval Academy” are omitted. The statute is interpreted as covering all midshipmen, including the reserve category created by subsequent statute. The word “sold” is substituted for the word “furnished” for directness of expression.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
