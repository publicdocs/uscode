## § 7223. Acquisition of land for radio stations and for other purposes

    Land of the United States that is under the control of any department or agency of the United States may be mutually selected as a site for a naval radio station by the Secretary of the Navy and the head of the department or agency having control of the land. By direction of the President, land so selected may be transferred to and placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy for use as a naval radio station or for any other naval purpose.

    The word “agency” is substituted for the word “branch” to conform to present terminology. The words “by the Secretary of the Navy and the head of the department or agency having control of the land” are added to identify the officials who “mutually” select the site.
