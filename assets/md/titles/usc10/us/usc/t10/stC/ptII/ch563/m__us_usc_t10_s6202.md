## § 6202. Insane members of the naval service

    A member of the naval service who becomes insane may be placed in the hospital for the insane that, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy, is most convenient and will provide the most beneficial treatment.

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 387][/us/stat/70A/387].)

    The words “that \* \* \* will provide the most beneficial treatment” are substituted for the words “best calculated to promise a restoration of reason” for clarity. The second sentence of [34 U.S.C. 595][/us/usc/t34/s595] is omitted as superseded. It provided a method by which the Secretary of the Navy, in his discretion, could compensate other agencies for expenses involved in hospitalizing insane naval patients. Other provisions of law, principally [24 U.S.C. 31][/us/usc/t24/s31], [31 U.S.C. 686][/us/usc/t31/s686], and [37 U.S.C. 284][/us/usc/t37/s284], and regulations, principally Executive Order 10122, of April 14, 1950, establish the method currently used.
