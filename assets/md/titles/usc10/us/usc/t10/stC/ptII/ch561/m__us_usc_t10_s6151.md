    Subsections (b) and (c) are worded to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 ([37 U.S.C. 231][/us/usc/t37/s231] et seq.). The second and third provisos in [34 U.S.C. 410c(a)][/us/usc/t34/s410c/a], relating to the computation of retired pay for officers whose pay on the active list was not based on years of service, are omitted as obsolete, since under the Career Compensation Act of 1949, the active-duty pay of all officers is based on years of service.

    In subsection (d) the words “A retired member who is advanced \* \* \* from the grade of warrant officer, W–1, or from an enlisted grade” are substituted for the words “Enlisted men and warrant officers \* \* \* advanced” and the words “as a warrant officer, W–1, or an enlisted member” are substituted for the words “to be enlisted or warrant officer personnel” because the Warrant Officer Act of 1954 established the grade of warrant officer, W–1, in lieu of the old warrant officer (as distinguished from commissioned warrant officer) grades. The words “rank or” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “within three months of the date of the approval of this Act” and “whichever is the later” are omitted as executed.
