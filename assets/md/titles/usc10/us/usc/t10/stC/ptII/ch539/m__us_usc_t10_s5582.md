    The words “active list” are inserted so that this section will apply only to officers of the Regular Navy holding permanent appointments in grades above commissioned warrant officer, as this was the intent of the source statute. The words “same grade” are substituted for the words “corresponding rank and grade” in subsection (a) and for the words “corresponding grade” in subsection (b), since, under § 405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 ([34 U.S.C. 10a][/us/usc/t34/s10a]), the grades in the staff corps are the same as those in the line. The words “transfer and” and “transferred and” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (a) the words “and precedence in the line” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b) reference to the Construction Corps is omitted because that corps was abolished by the [Act of June 25, 1940, ch. 420, § 1][/us/act/1940-06-25/ch420/s1], [54 Stat. 528][/us/stat/54/528].

    The word “male” is inserted in both subsections to limit their application to men. Authority to appoint women is covered in [§ 5590 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s5590].

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “A regular officer” for “Any male officer on the active list” and “in the line” for “to the active list in the line” and deleted provision assigning an officer so appointed the lineal position he would have held had he originally been appointed in and had he remained in the line and provision that such an officer was to be considered an additional number in each grade in which he served.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “A regular officer” for “Any male officer on the active list” and “the same grade in a staff corps under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense” for “the active list of the Navy in the Supply Corps or the Civil Engineer Corps, in the same grade, without regard to his age.”

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Sept. 15, 1981, but the authority to prescribe regulations under the amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective on Dec. 12, 1980, see [section 701 of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
