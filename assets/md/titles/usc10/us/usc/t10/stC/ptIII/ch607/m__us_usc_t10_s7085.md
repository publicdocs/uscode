## § 7085. Computation of life annuity

    Each civilian member who retires under [section 7084 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s7084] is entitled to a life annuity computed by multiplying his average annual compensation during any five consecutive years of allowable service, at his option, by his number of years of service, not exceeding 35, and dividing the product by 70. The retirement annuity payable to a retired civilian member under a policy required by [section 7082 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s7082] is counted as part of the retirement annuity provided in this section. Any difference between the amount received by the retired civilian member under his annuity policy and the total annual amount to which he is entitled under this section shall be paid to him by the Secretary of the Navy from appropriations made for this purpose.

    The words “terminable on his death at the rate of the following total annual amount” are omitted as surplusage, since they are covered by the words “life annuity”.

    The words “basic salary, pay, or” are omitted as surplusage, since they are covered by the word “compensation”. The first proviso is omitted as unnecessary, since all existing rights and benefits of persons affected by this title are protected by a general saving provision.
