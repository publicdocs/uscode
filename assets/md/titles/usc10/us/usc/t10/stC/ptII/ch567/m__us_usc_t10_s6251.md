## § 6251. Delegation of power to award

    The President may delegate, under such conditions as he prescribes, to flag and general officers who are commanders-in-chief or commanding on important independent duty, his authority to award the Navy cross, the distinguished-service medal, the silver star medal, or the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

    The term “flag officers” is used generically in [34 U.S.C. 364][/us/usc/t34/s364]. Officers of the Marine Corps who meet the duty requirements, if in the equivalent grades, are, therefore, within its terms and the authority to make the awards has been delegated to such officers.
