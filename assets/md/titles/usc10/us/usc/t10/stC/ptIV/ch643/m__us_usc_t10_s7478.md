    In subsection (a) the words “for the proper instruction of naval personnel” and in subsection (b) the words “out of naval appropriations” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c) the words “except the authority to prescribe regulations” are omitted, since [34 U.S.C. 1071][/us/usc/t34/s1071] contains no authority for the Secretary to prescribe regulations.

 __Amendments__ 

    1997—[Pub. L. 105–85, § 1109(b)(1)][/us/pl/105/85/s1109/b/1], substituted “Marine Corps University” for “Marine Corps Command and Staff College” in section catchline.
