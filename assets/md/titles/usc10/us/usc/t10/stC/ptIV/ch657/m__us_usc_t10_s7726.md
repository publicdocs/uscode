## § 7726. Reconsideration of stay

    (a) A claimant or party who considers himself adversely affected by a stay under this chapter may serve a written notice on the Secretary of the Navy at Washington, D.C., requesting him to reconsider the stay previously issued and to issue a new certificate. The notice shall identify the stay by means of an attached copy of the certificate of the Secretary or a sufficient description of the stay. The notice may not contain any recital of the facts or circumstances involved.

    (b) Within ten days after receiving notice under this section, the Secretary or his designee shall hold a secret meeting at which the claimant or party, or his representative, may present any facts and arguments he thinks material.

    (c) Within ten days after a hearing under this section, the Secretary shall file with the court that ordered the stay a new certificate stating whether the stay is then to be terminated or for what period the stay is to continue in effect. If the Secretary fails to file a new certificate, the court, upon application by the claimant or party, shall issue an order directing the Secretary to file a new certificate within a specified time.
