 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1956__  __Act__ 

    The [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343], as amended ([5 U.S.C. 411a(a)][/us/usc/t5/s411a/a]) which is the National Security Act of 1947, defined “Department of the Navy”. The Acts of [Mar. 5, 1948, ch. 98][/us/act/1948-03-05/ch98] ([5 U.S.C. 423a(a)][/us/usc/t5/s423a/a]), and [Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 756][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch756] ([5 U.S.C. 421g][/us/usc/t5/s421g]) defined “Naval Establishment”. The terms “Department of the Navy” and “Naval Establishment” are considered to be synonymous. All three definitions were considered, but the phraseology adopted is that of the National Security Act of 1947. The phrase “as a service in the Navy” is substituted for “as a part of the Navy” to conform to the provisions of title 14.

    The words “to include naval aviation and the United States Marine Corps” are omitted as covered by the first sentence of section 5011. The word “operates” is substituted for the words “shall function”.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–433][/us/pl/99/433], § 511(c)(1), substituted “Organization” for “Composition” in section catchline.

    [Pub.

It includes the United States Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy.” See [section 5061 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s5061].

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–651][/us/pl/87/651] inserted sentences providing that the Department of the Navy is separately organized under the Secretary of the Navy, and that it operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense.
