    1958—[Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] substituted “benefits” for “pay and allowances” in section catchline, and struck out provisions which prescribed the rate of pay of cadets, which authorized them to receive the same allowances for subsistence as prescribed for officers, which related to the furnishing of quarters, medical care and hospitalization, and which authorized transportation and expenses while traveling under orders.
