    There is no provision of law specifically stating that the Medical Corps is in the Medical Department. It was the first corps to have duties relating to medical and sanitary matters and so long as it was the only corps having such duties there was no need for the departmental concept. The subsequent establishment of other corps with related duties “in the Medical Department” indicates clearly that the Medical Corps is in that Department.

    The words “effective August 4, 1947” and the words “establishing the Medical Service Corps” in [34 U.S.C. 30a][/us/usc/t34/s30a] are omitted as executed. The words “is created and established as a Staff Corps of the United States Navy” in [34 U.S.C. 43][/us/usc/t34/s43] are omitted as executed.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–433][/us/pl/99/433] substituted “section 5150(b)” for “section 5155(b)”.

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] authorized the Secretary of the Navy to designate staff corps as being in the Medical Department of the Navy and deleted specific references to the Medical Service Corps, the Nurse Corps, and the Hospital Corps as being in such Medical Department.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Sept. 15, 1981, but the authority to prescribe regulations under the amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective on Dec. 12, 1980, see [section 701 of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].

 __Transition Provisions Under Defense Officer Personnel Management Act__ 

    For provisions to prevent extinction or premature termination of rights, duties, penalties, or proceedings that existed or were begun prior to the effective date of [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] and otherwise to allow for an orderly transition to the system of officer personnel management put in place under [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513], see section 601 et seq. of [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513], set out as a note under [section 611 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s611].
