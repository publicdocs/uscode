## § 7661. Interrogation of witnesses by prize commissioners

    Witnesses before the prize commissioners shall be questioned separately, on interrogatories prescribed by the court, in the manner usual in prize courts. Without special authority from the court, the witnesses may not see the interrogatories, documents, or papers, or consult with counsel or with other persons interested in the cause. Witnesses who have the rights of neutrals shall be discharged as soon as practicable.
