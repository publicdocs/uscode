    The words “The Secretary of the Navy may restrict a certificate” are substituted for the words “Any certificate \* \* \* by the Secretary of the Navy \* \* \* may, in his discretion, be restricted.” The words “the production of” are inserted for clarity. The words “in which event” are omitted as surplusage.
