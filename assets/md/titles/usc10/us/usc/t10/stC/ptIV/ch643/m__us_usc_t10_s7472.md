## § 7472. Physical examination: employees engaged in hazardous occupations

    (a) The Secretary of the Navy may provide for physical examination by civilians of employees engaged in hazardous occupations, where the professional services of the Medical Department are not available. The Secretary may compensate these civilians for their services, on a contract or fee basis, at the rates customary in the locality.

    (b) The Secretary, to the extent he considers proper, may delegate the authority conferred by this section to any person in the Department of the Navy, with or without the authority to make successive redelegations.

    In subsection (b) the words “except the authority to prescribe regulations” are omitted, since [5 U.S.C. 415c][/us/usc/t5/s415c] contains no authority for the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe regulations for the administration of that section.
