    In subsection (b) the words “rules and” are omitted. The words “United States naval service” are substituted for the words “United States Navy” for uniformity.

    In subsection (c) the words “to any office or position” are omitted as surplusage. The words “or Marine Corps” are inserted, as the word “Navy” in this context has been interpreted to include officers of the Marine Corps.
