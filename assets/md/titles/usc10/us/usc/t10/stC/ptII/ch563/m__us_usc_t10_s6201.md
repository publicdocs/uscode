## § 6201. Members of the naval service in other United States hospitals

    (a) When appropriate naval hospital facilities are unavailable, the Secretary of the Navy may provide for the care and treatment of members of the naval service, entitled to treatment in naval hospitals, in other United States hospitals, if the agencies controlling the other hospitals consent. Expenses incident to such care and treatment are chargeable to the same appropriation as would be chargeable for care and treatment in a naval hospital.

    (b) The deduction authorized by section 4812 of the Revised Statutes ([24 U.S.C. 16][/us/usc/t24/s16]) shall be made from accounts of members hospitalized under this section.

    In subsection (a) the words “members of the naval service” are substituted for the words “naval patients on the active or retired list and members of the Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve”. The definition of “member of the naval service” makes the terms coextensive. Reference to St. Elizabeths Hospital is omitted in view of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, § 201, [60 Stat. 1098][/us/stat/60/1098], which transferred the functions of that hospital pertaining to members of the naval service to the Secretary of the Navy. For the purposes of this section, St. Elizabeths is now in the same category as other United States hospitals.

    In subsection (b) reference to R.S. 4813 ([24 U.S.C. 6][/us/usc/t24/s6]) is omitted because the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs held in Decision Number 571 (July 27, 1944) that R.S. 4813 was repealed by implication. Since this decision is binding on the Secretary of the Navy (see [38 U.S.C. 11a–2][/us/usc/t38/s11a–2]), the deductions from pension accounts authorized by R.S. 4813 may not be made.

    In subsection (c) the words “each retired enlisted member of the naval service” are substituted for the words “retired enlisted men” and the words “is entitled to” are substituted for the words “shall receive” to conform to terminology used throughout this title. The words “equal in value to the hospital ration” are substituted for the words “prescribed by law for enlisted men of the Regular Navy” to show that the amount of the allowance is the value of the hospital ration. The words “for each day” are inserted to make it clear that the ration allowance is credited on a daily basis. The words “under this section” are substituted for the words “in a Federal hospital in accordance with law” because this section is the only authority for the hospitalization of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve and retired enlisted members of the naval service in Federal hospitals, other than naval hospitals, under conditions entitling the members to a ration allowance. The subsistence of a member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve or a retired enlisted member of the naval service while hospitalized in naval hospitals is covered by [§ 6086 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s6086].

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “section 4812 of the Revised Statutes ([24 U.S.C. 16][/us/usc/t24/s16])” for “[section 16 of title 24][/us/usc/t24/s16]”.

    1958—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] repealed subsec. (c) which related to a ration allowance for members of the Fleet Reserve of the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve and retired enlisted members of the naval service.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] effective Dec. 12, 1980, see [section 701(b)(3) of Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513/s701/b/3], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
