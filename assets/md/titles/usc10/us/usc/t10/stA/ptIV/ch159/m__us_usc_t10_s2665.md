    In subsection (a), the words “an executive department or the Federal Maritime Board” are substituted for the words “any department or the United States Maritime Commission” to reflect an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1954/1723) and to name the successor of the United States Maritime Commission. The last 18 words are inserted to reflect that opinion (see the Act of February 20, 1931 ([10 U.S.C. 1354][/us/usc/t10/s1354])). The words “and dispose of” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b), the words “an executive department or the Federal Maritime Board” are inserted for clarity and to name the successor of the United States Maritime Commission.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the word “person” is substituted for the words “individuals, corporations,” since [section 1 of title 1][/us/usc/t1/s1] defines the word “person” to cover both individuals and corporations. The words “States or” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), the words “the selling agency” are substituted for the words “his above representatives selling or disposing of the same”.

 __1982__  __ Act__ 

    This corrects an error in an amendment to 10:2665 made by section 12(3)(B) of the Maritime Act of 1981 ([Pub. L. 97–31][/us/pl/97/31], Aug. 6, 1981, [95 Stat. 153][/us/stat/95/153]).

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 109–163][/us/pl/109/163] struck out “under [section 2664 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2664]” after “land that is acquired”.

    2002—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 107–296][/us/pl/107/296] substituted “Department in which the Coast Guard is operating” for “Department of Transportation”.

    1986—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(1)][/us/pl/99/561/s4/1], struck out “available for operation and maintenance during a fiscal year” after “Defense”, substituted “costs” for “expenses”, and struck out “during such fiscal year” after “such property”.

    Subsec. (e)(1). [Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(2)][/us/pl/99/561/s4/2], struck out “for all expenses of production of forest products” after “subsection (d)”.

    Subsec. (f)(1). [Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(3)(A)][/us/pl/99/561/s4/3/A], (B), substituted “costs” for “expenses” in provisions preceding subpar. (A) and amended subpar. (C) generally. Prior to amendment, subpar. (C) read as follows: “for expenses to enable operations of forest lands and the production of forest products to continue from the end of one fiscal year through the beginning of the next fiscal year without disruption.”

    Subsec. (f)(2), (3). [Pub. L. 99–561, § 4(3)(C)][/us/pl/99/561/s4/3/C], amended pars. (2) and (3) generally. Prior to amendment, pars. (2) and (3) read as follows:

    “(2) Subject to paragraph (3), there shall be deposited into the reserve account not later than December 31 of each year, for credit to the preceding fiscal year, an amount equal to one-half of the amount (if any) remaining of the total amount received by the United States during that fiscal year as proceeds from the sale of forest products after (A) the reimbursement of appropriations of the Department of Defense under subsection (d) for expenses of production of forest products during that fiscal year, and (B) the payment to States under subsection (e) for that fiscal year.

    “(3) The balance in the reserve account may not exceed $4,000,000. If a deposit under paragraph (2) would cause the balance in the account to exceed that amount, the deposit shall be made only to the extent the amount of the deposit would not cause the balance in the account to exceed $4,000,000.”

    1984—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 98–407, § 809(a)(1)][/us/pl/98/407/s809/a/1], substituted “forest products produced on land owned or leased by a military department or the” for “logs wholly or partly manufactured by, or otherwise procured for, the Army, Navy, or Air Force, or”.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 98–407, § 809(a)(2)][/us/pl/98/407/s809/a/2], substituted “forest products” for “lumber and timber products”.

    Subsec. (e)(1). [Pub. L. 98–407, § 809(a)(3)][/us/pl/98/407/s809/a/3], substituted “forest products” for “timber and timber products” in two places and “40 percent” for “25 percent”.

    Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 98–407, § 809(a)(4)][/us/pl/98/407/s809/a/4], added subsec. (f).

    1982—Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 97–295][/us/pl/97/295] substituted “executive department, may sell” for “executive department” and all that followed through “may sell” in subsecs. (a) and (b), and substituted “Air Force, or Department of Transportation.” for “Air Force” and all that followed in subsec. (b), clarifying the ambiguity created by the conflicting language of [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] and [Pub. L. 97–31][/us/pl/97/31].

    1981—Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 97–31][/us/pl/97/31] struck out reference to Federal Maritime Commission in subsec. (a), and substituted “or Department of Transportation” for “or Federal Maritime Commission” and struck out “or the Federal Maritime Commission” after “department” in subsec. (b). Amendment was executed to text in accordance with the probable intent of Congress, notwithstanding amendment of section by [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] which substituted different language than language contained in amendatory provisions of [Pub. L. 97–31][/us/pl/97/31].

    Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 97–99][/us/pl/97/99] added subsec. (e).

    1980—Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 96–513][/us/pl/96/513] substituted “Federal Maritime Commission” for “Federal Maritime Board”.

    1977—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 95–82][/us/pl/95/82] substituted provisions relating to reimbursement of production expenses during any fiscal year from proceeds from sales for property during such fiscal year, for provisions requiring proceeds from sales under subsecs. (a) or (b) of this section to be credited to the appropriations under which the property concerned was procured.
