    (a)

     No commissioned officer may be dismissed from any armed force except—

        (1) by sentence of a general court-martial;

        (2) in commutation of a sentence of a general court-martial; or

        (3) in time of war, by order of the President.

    (b) The President may drop from the rolls of any armed force any commissioned officer (1) who has been absent without authority for at least three months, (2) who may be separated under [section 1167 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1167] by reason of a sentence to confinement adjudged by a court-martial, or (3) who is sentenced to confinement in a Federal or State penitentiary or correctional institution after having been found guilty of an offense by a court other than a court-martial or other military court, and whose sentence has become final.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the word “commissioned” is inserted since, for the Army and the Air Force, the term “officer” is intended to have the same meaning in 50:739 as it has in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (article 4). For Navy warrant officers see [section 6408 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s6408].

    In subsection (b), the words “from his place of duty” are omitted as surplusage. The words “at least” are substituted for the words “or more”. The words “by a court other than a court-martial or other military court” are substituted for the words “by the civil authorities”.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 104–201][/us/pl/104/201] substituted “section 1167” for “section 1178” in par. (2).

    [Pub. L. 104–106][/us/pl/104/106] struck out “or” after “three months,”, added par. (2), and redesignated former par. (2) as (3).

After the date of enactment of this Act \[Aug. 25, 1958\], such a former retired officer may, in the discretion of the President, have his entitlement to retired or retirement pay under this Act terminated for any reason for which any retired officer may be dismissed from, or dropped from the rolls of, any Armed Force.
