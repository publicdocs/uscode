    (d)  __Civilian Facility Service Area__  __.—__ 

    For purposes of the specialized treatment facility program, the service area of a civilian health care facility designated pursuant to subsection (b) shall be comparable in size to the service areas of facilities of the uniformed services.

    A covered beneficiary who resides within the service area of a specialized treatment facility designated under the specialized treatment facility program may be required to obtain a nonavailability of health care statement in the case of a specialized service offered by the facility in order for the covered beneficiary to receive the service outside of the program.

            (B) Full or partial reimbursement of a person (including a member of the uniformed services) for the reasonable expenses of transportation, temporary lodging, and meals (not to exceed a per diem rate determined in accordance with implementing regulations) incurred by such person in accompanying a covered beneficiary as a nonmedical attendant to a health care facility referred to in subparagraph (A).

            (C) In-kind transportation, lodging, or meals instead of reimbursements under subparagraph (A) or (B) for transportation, lodging, or meals, respectively.

        (2) The Secretary may make reimbursements for or provide transportation, lodging, and meals under paragraph (1) in the case of a covered beneficiary only if the total cost to the Department of Defense of doing so and of providing the health care in such case is less than the cost to the Department of providing the health care to the covered beneficiary by other means authorized under this chapter.
