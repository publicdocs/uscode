         Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serves as the spokesman for the commanders of the combatant commands, especially on the operational requirements of their commands. In performing such function, the Chairman shall—

            (A) confer with and obtain information from the commanders of the combatant commands with respect to the requirements of their commands;

            (B) evaluate and integrate such information;

            (C) advise and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense with respect to the requirements of the combatant commands, individually and collectively; and

            (D) communicate, as appropriate, the requirements of the combatant commands to other elements of the Department of Defense.
