    In clause (1), the words “(if any)” are omitted as surplusage. The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for the words “Commandant, United States Coast Guard, Treasury Department”, since the functions of the Coast Guard and its officers, while operating under the Department of the Treasury, were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 26, effective July 31, 1950, [64 Stat. 1280][/us/stat/64/1280]. Under that plan the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to delegate any of those functions to the agencies and employees of the Department of the Treasury.

    Clauses (2) and (3) are inserted for clarity, and are based on the usage of those terms throughout the revised chapter.

> “The Congress finds that recent disclosures of excessive payments by the Department of Defense for replenishment parts have undermined confidence by the public and Congress in the defense procurement system. The Secretary of Defense should make every effort to reform procurement practices relating to replenishment parts. Such efforts should, among other matters, be directed to the elimination of excessive pricing of replenishment spare parts and the recovery of unjustified payments. Specifically, the Secretary should—

>     “(1) direct that officials in the Department of Defense refuse to enter into contracts unless the proposed prices are fair and reasonable;

>     “(2) continue and accelerate ongoing efforts to improve defense contracting procedures in order to encourage effective competition and assure fair and reasonable prices;

>     “(3) direct that replenishment parts be acquired in economic order quantities and on a multiyear basis whenever feasible, practicable, and cost effective;

>     “(4) direct that standard or commercial parts be used whenever such use is technically acceptable and cost effective; and

>     “(5) vigorously continue reexamination of policies relating to acquisition, pricing, and management of replenishment parts and of technical data related to such parts.”

 __Modification of Regulations and Directives To Accommodate a Policy of Multiyear Procurement__

 __Procurement Requirements for Goods Which Are Not American Goods__ 

    [Pub.
