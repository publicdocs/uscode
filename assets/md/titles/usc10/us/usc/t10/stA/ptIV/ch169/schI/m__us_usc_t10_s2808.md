## § 2808. Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency

    (a) In the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the President of a national emergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t50/s1601] et seq.) that requires use of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. Such projects may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds that have been appropriated for military construction, including funds appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.

    (b) When a decision is made to undertake military construction projects authorized by this section, the Secretary of Defense shall notify the appropriate committees of Congress of the decision and of the estimated cost of the construction projects, including the cost of any real estate action pertaining to those construction projects.

    (c) The authority described in subsection (a) shall terminate with respect to any war or national emergency at the end of the war or national emergency.

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t50/s1601] et seq.), and [section 301 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], United States Code, I declared a national emergency that requires the use of the Armed Forces of the United States, by Proclamation 7463 of September 14, 2001 \[[50 U.S.C. 1621][/us/usc/t50/s1621] note\], because of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and because of the continuing and immediate threat to the national security of the United States of further terrorist attacks. To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to respond to that threat, and in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1631][/us/usc/t50/s1631]), I hereby order that the emergency construction authority at [10 U.S.C. 2808][/us/usc/t10/s2808] is invoked and made available in accordance with its terms to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments.

                              George W. Bush.
