    “(a) Determinations and decisions required to be made under this chapter by the head of an agency may be made for an individual purchase or contract or, except for determinations and decisions under section 2304 or 2305 of this title, for a class of purchases or contracts. Such a determination or decision, including a determination or decision under section 2304 or 2305 of this title, is final.

    “(b) Each determination or decision under section 2306(c), 2306(g)(1), 2307(c), or 2313(c) of this title shall be based on a written finding by the person making the determination or decision, which finding shall set out facts and circumstances that—

    “(1) clearly indicate why the type of contract selected under [section 2306(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2306/c] is likely to be less costly than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain property or services of the kind or quality required except under such a contract;

    “(2) support the findings required by [section 2306(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2306/g/1];

    “(3) clearly indicate why advance payments under [section 2307(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2307/c] would be in the public interest; or

    “(4) clearly indicate why the application of [section 2313(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2313/b] to a contract or subcontract with a foreign contractor or foreign subcontractor would not be in the public interest.

    Such a finding is final and shall be kept available in the agency for at least six years after the date of the determination or decision. A copy of the finding shall be submitted to the General Accounting Office with each contract to which it applies.”

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 98–369][/us/pl/98/369], § 2725(2), amended subsec. (b) generally, striking out requirement that determinations to negotiate contracts be based on written findings by the contracting officers making the determinations.

    1968—Subsec. (b). [Pub.

    1962—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 87–653][/us/pl/87/653] substituted “section 2306(c)” for “section 2306”, required decisions to negotiate contracts under section 2304(a)(2), (7), (8), (10) to (12) of this title to be based on a written finding by the person making the decision, which findings shall set out facts and circumstances illustrative of conditions described in section 2304(a)(11) to (16), indicate why the type of contract selected under section 2306(c) is likely to be less costly than any other or that its impracticable to obtain the required property or services except under such contract, indicate why advance payments under section 2307(c) would be in the public interest, or establish with respect to section 2304(a), (2), (7), (8), (10) to (12) that formal advertising would not have been feasible and practicable.
