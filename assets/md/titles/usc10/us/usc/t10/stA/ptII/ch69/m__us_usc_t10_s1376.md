    In subsection (a), the word “maintained” is substituted for the word “established”, and in subsection (b), the word “maintain” is substituted for the word “established”, since the lists have been established and are published annually.

    In subsection (a), the words “who are in the Retired Reserve” are substituted for 50:927(a) (last 11 words), since [section 271 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s271] prescribes the conditions for being placed in the Retired Reserve. 50:927(b) (last sentence) is omitted, since the revised section provides that both lists be maintained.

    In subsection (b), the words “containing the names placed thereon under section 1202 or 1205 of this title” are substituted for the words “upon which shall be placed the names of all members of his service entitled to such placement pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter”.
