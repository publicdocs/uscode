    In subsection (a), the wording of the special definition of “vessel” and “American vessel”, contained in section 16 of the Neutrality Act of 1939, [54 Stat. 12][/us/stat/54/12] ([22 U.S.C. 456][/us/usc/t22/s456]), is substituted for the words “any American vessel as defined in the Neutrality Act of 1939”.

    In subsection (b), the words “or national emergency” are omitted, since the words of the source statute defining that term have been substituted for it.

    In subsection (c), the words “(relating to bonds from armed vessels on clearing)” are omitted as surplusage.
