    In subsection (a), the words “an armed force” are substituted for the words “armies and navies”. The words “Revolutionary War”, “Civil War”, and “Philippine Insurrection” are substituted for the words “War of the Revolution”, “War of the Rebellion”, and “incident insurrection in the Philippines”, respectively, to reflect present terminology. The words “originally composed” are substituted for the words “in their own right”, to reflect an opinion of the Attorney General (see 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 454).

    In subsections (a) and (b), the word “member” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”. The words “Navy \* \* \* or Marine Corps” are substituted for the word “Navy”, since the word “Navy” in the source statute has, by long-standing administrative interpretation, been construed to include the Marine Corps.

    In subsection (b), the words “in their own right” are omitted as surplusage.
