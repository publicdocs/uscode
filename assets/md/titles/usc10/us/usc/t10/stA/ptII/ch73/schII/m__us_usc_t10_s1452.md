                (iii)  __New entrants after enactment of flat-rate reduction__  __.—__ 

                In the case of a person who first becomes a member of a uniformed service on or after March 1, 1990, and who is entitled to retired pay under a provision of law other than chapter 61 or chapter 1223 of this title, the reduction shall be in an amount equal to 6½ percent of the base amount.

                (iv)  __Alternative reduction amounts__  __.—__ 

                For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), the alternative reduction amounts are the following:

                    (I)  __Flat-rate reduction__  __.—__ 

                    An amount equal to 6½ percent of the base amount.

                    (II)  __Amount under pre-flat-rate reduction__  __.—__ 

                    An amount equal to 2½ percent of the first $337 (as adjusted after November 1, 1989, under paragraph (4)) of the base amount plus 10 percent of the remainder of the base amount.

            (B)  __Reserve-component annuity__  __.—__

        (2)  __Additional reduction for child coverage__  __.—__ 

        If there is a dependent child as well as a spouse or former spouse, the amount prescribed under paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount prescribed under regulations of the Secretary of Defense.

        (3)  __No reduction when no beneficiary__  __.—__ 

        The reduction in retired pay prescribed by paragraph (1) shall not be applicable during any month in which there is no eligible spouse or former spouse beneficiary.

        (4) __Periodic adjustments.—__ 

            (A)  __Adjustments for increases in rates of basic pay__  __.—__ 

            Whenever there is an increase in the rates of basic pay of members of the uniformed services effective on or after October 1, 1985, the amounts under paragraph (1) with respect to which the percentage factor of 2½ is applied shall be increased by the overall percentage of such increase in the rates of basic pay. The increase under the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to persons whose retired pay is computed based on the rates of basic pay in effect on or after the date of such increase in rates of basic pay.

            (B)  __Adjustments for retired pay colas__  __.—__ 

            In addition to the increase under subparagraph (A), the amounts under paragraph (1) with respect to which the percentage factor of 2½ is applied shall be further increased at the same time and by the same percentage as an increase in retired pay under [section 1401a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401a] effective on or after October 1, 1985. Such increase under the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a person who initially participates in the Plan on a date which is after both the effective date of such increase under section 1401a and the effective date of the rates of basic pay upon which that person’s retired pay is computed.

        (5)  __Spouse coverage described__  __.—__ 

        For the purposes of paragraph (1), a participant in the Plan who is providing spouse coverage is a participant who—

            (A) has (i) a spouse or former spouse, or (ii) a spouse or former spouse and a dependent child; and

            (B) has not elected to provide an annuity to a person designated by him under [section 1448(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/b/1] or, having made such an election, has changed his election in favor of his spouse under [section 1450(f) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1450/f].

    (b) __Child-Only Annuities.—__

        The retired pay of a participant in the Plan who is providing child-only coverage (as described in paragraph (4)) shall be reduced by an amount prescribed under regulations by the Secretary of Defense.

        There shall be no reduction in retired pay under paragraph (1) for any month during which the participant has no eligible dependent child.

        (3)  __Special rule for certain rcsbp participants__  __.—__ 

        In the case of a participant in the Plan who is participating in the Plan under an election under [section 1448(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/a/2/B] and who provided child-only coverage during a period before the participant becomes entitled to receive retired pay, the retired pay of the participant shall be reduced by an amount prescribed under regulations by the Secretary of Defense to reflect the coverage provided under the Plan during the period before the participant became entitled to receive retired pay. A reduction under this paragraph is in addition to any reduction under paragraph (1) and is made without regard to whether there is an eligible dependent child during a month for which the reduction is made.

        (4)  __Child-only coverage defined__  __.—__ 

        For the purposes of this subsection, a participant in the Plan who is providing child-only coverage is a participant who has a dependent child and who—

            (A) does not have an eligible spouse or former spouse; or

            (B) has a spouse or former spouse but has elected to provide an annuity for dependent children only.

    (c) __Reduction for Insurable Interest Coverage.—__

            (A)  __Conditions for resumption__  __.—__ 

            A person described in paragraph (1) who discontinued participation in the Plan may elect to participate again in the Plan if—

        (2) __Coordination when payment of increase in retired pay is delayed by law.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the initial payment of an increase in retired pay under [section 1401a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401a] (or any other provision of law) to a person is for a month that begins later than the effective date of that increase by reason of the application of subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section (or [section 631(b) of Public Law 104–106][/us/pl/104/106/s631/b] ([110 Stat. 364][/us/stat/110/364])), then the amount of the reduction in the person’s retired pay shall be effective on the date of that initial payment of the increase in retired pay rather than the effective date of the increase in retired pay.

            Subparagraph (A) may not be construed as delaying, for purposes of determining the amount of a monthly annuity under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1451], the effective date of an increase in a base amount under subsection (h) of such section from the effective date of an increase in retired pay under [section 1401a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401a] to the date on which the initial payment of that increase in retired pay is made in accordance with subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section.

    (i)  __Recomputation of Reduction Upon Recomputation of Retired Pay__  __.—__ 

    Whenever the retired pay of a person who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after August 1, 1986, and who is a participant in the Plan is recomputed under [section 1410 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1410] upon the person’s becoming 62 years of age, the amount of the reduction in such retired pay under this section shall be recomputed (effective on the effective date of the recomputation of such retired pay under [section 1410 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1410]) so as to be the amount equal to the amount of such reduction that would be in effect on that date if increases in such retired pay under [section 1401a(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401a/b], and increases in reductions in such retired pay under subsection (h), had been computed as provided in paragraph (2) of [section 1401a(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401a/b] (rather than under paragraph (3) of that section).
