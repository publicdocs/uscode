            (A) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may designate up to 15 general and flag officer positions in the unified and specified combatant commands, and up to three general and flag officer positions on the Joint Staff, as positions to be held only by reserve component officers who are in a general or flag officer grade below lieutenant general or vice admiral. Each position so designated shall be considered to be a joint duty assignment position for purposes of chapter 38 of this title.

            (B) A reserve component officer serving in a position designated under subparagraph (A) while on active duty under a call or order to active duty that does not specify a period of 180 days or less shall not be counted for the purposes of the limitations under subsection (a) and under [section 525 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s525] if the officer was selected for service in that position in accordance with the procedures specified in subparagraph (C).

                (i) the Secretary of Defense shall require the Secretary of the Army to submit the name of at least one Army reserve component officer, the Secretary of the Navy to submit the name of at least one Navy Reserve officer and the name of at least one Marine Corps Reserve officer, and the Secretary of the Air Force to submit the name of at least one Air Force reserve component officer for consideration by the Secretary for assignment to that position; and

            (E) Subparagraph (B) does not apply in the case of an officer serving in a position designated under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary of Defense, when considering officers for assignment to fill the vacancy in that position which was filled by that officer, did not have a recommendation for that assignment from each Secretary of a military department who (pursuant to subparagraph (C)) was required to make such a recommendation.

    \[(c) Repealed. [Pub. L. 107–314, div. A, title X, § 1041(a)(3)][/us/pl/107/314/s1041/a/3], Dec. 2, 2002, [116 Stat. 2645][/us/stat/116/2645].\]

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Section is based on [Pub. L. 95–79, title VIII, § 811(a)][/us/pl/95/79/s811/a], July 30, 1977, [91 Stat. 335][/us/stat/91/335], as amended by [Pub. L. 96–107, title VIII, § 817][/us/pl/96/107/s817], Nov. 9, 1979, [93 Stat. 818][/us/stat/93/818]; [Pub. L. 96–342, title X, § 1003][/us/pl/96/342/s1003], Sept. 8, 1980, [94 Stat. 1120][/us/stat/94/1120]; [Pub. L. 97–86, title VI, § 602][/us/pl/97/86/s602], Dec. 1, 1981, [95 Stat. 1110][/us/stat/95/1110].

    Present law ([section 811(a) of Public Law 95–79][/us/pl/95/79/s811/a], as amended) provides that the authority to suspend the limitation on the number of general and flag officers who may be serving on active duty applies during war or national emergency. In codifying the limitation (in [section 526 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s526] as proposed to be added by section 1(b) of the bill), the committee determined that the same war and emergency waiver authority as applies to other limitations on the number of officers on active duty under the existing [10 U.S.C. 526][/us/usc/t10/s526] (redesignated as [10 U.S.C. 527][/us/usc/t10/s527] by the bill) should apply with respect to this limitation and accordingly amended the suspension authority in present law to include the codified general and flag officer limitation. This authority is slightly different from the waiver authority in the source law in that the suspension would expire 2 years after it takes effect or 1 year after the end of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first, rather than upon termination of the war or emergency.
