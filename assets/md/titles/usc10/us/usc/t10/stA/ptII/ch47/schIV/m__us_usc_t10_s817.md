    In subsection (a), the word “has” is substituted for the words “shall have”.

    In subsection (b), the word “after” is substituted for the words “subsequent to”. The words “the provisions of” are omitted as surplusage. The words “department that includes the” are inserted before the words “armed force”, since the review is carried out by the department and not by the armed force.
