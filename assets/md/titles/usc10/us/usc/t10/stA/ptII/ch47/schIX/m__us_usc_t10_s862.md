## § 862. Art. 62. Appeal by the United States

    (a)

        (1)

         In a trial by court-martial in which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may appeal the following (other than an order or ruling that is, or that amounts to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification):

            (A) An order or ruling of the military judge which terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification.

            (B) An order or ruling which excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

            (C) An order or ruling which directs the disclosure of classified information.

            (D) An order or ruling which imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information.

            (E) A refusal of the military judge to issue a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information.

            (F) A refusal by the military judge to enforce an order described in subparagraph (E) that has previously been issued by appropriate authority.

        (2) An appeal of an order or ruling may not be taken unless the trial counsel provides the military judge with written notice of appeal from the order or ruling within 72 hours of the order or ruling. Such notice shall include a certification by the trial counsel that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and (if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) that the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

        (3) An appeal under this section shall be diligently prosecuted by appellate Government counsel.

    (b) An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by a means prescribed under regulations of the President directly to the Court of Criminal Appeals and shall, whenever practicable, have priority over all other proceedings before that court. In ruling on an appeal under this section, the Court of Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding [section 866(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866/c] (article 66(c)).

    (c) Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this section shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial of a speedy trial unless an appropriate authority determines that the appeal was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was totally frivolous and without merit.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 104–106][/us/pl/104/106] amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: “In a trial by court-martial in which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may appeal an order or ruling of the military judge which terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification or which excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding. However, the United States may not appeal an order or ruling that is, or that amounts to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification.”

    1994—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–337][/us/pl/103/337] substituted “Court of Criminal Appeals” for “Court of Military Review” in two places.

L. 98–209][/us/pl/98/209] effective first day of eighth calendar month beginning after Dec. 6, 1983, but not to apply to any case in which the findings and sentence were adjudged by a court-martial before that date, and the proceedings in any such case to be held in the same manner and with the same effect as if such amendments had not been enacted, see section 12(a)(1), (4) of [Pub. L. 98–209][/us/pl/98/209], set out as a note under [section 801 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s801].
