         A cost estimate, including—

            (A) a life-cycle cost estimate that separately identifies the costs regarding research and development, procurement, military construction, operations and sustainment, and disposal;

            (B) program acquisition unit costs for the program element;

            (C) average procurement unit costs and program acquisition costs for the program element; and

            (D) an identification of when the document regarding the program joint cost analysis requirements description is scheduled to be approved.
