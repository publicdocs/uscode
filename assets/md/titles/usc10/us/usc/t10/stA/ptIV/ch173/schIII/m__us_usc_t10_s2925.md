        (5) A description of the actions taken to implement the energy performance master plan in effect under [section 2911 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2911] and carry out this chapter during the preceding fiscal year.

        (6) A description of the energy savings realized from such actions.

        (7) An estimate of the types and quantities of energy consumed by the Department of Defense and members of the armed forces and civilian personnel residing or working on military installations during the preceding fiscal year, including a breakdown of energy consumption by user groups and types of energy, energy costs, and the quantities of renewable energy produced or procured by the Department.
