    (b) The Secretary is the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense. Subject to the direction of the President and to this title and section 2 of the National Security Act of 1947 ([50 U.S.C. 3002][/us/usc/t50/s3002]) he has authority, direction, and control over the Department of Defense.

    (c)

        (1)

         The Secretary shall report annually in writing to the President and the Congress on the expenditures, work, and accomplishments of the Department of Defense during the period covered by the report, together with—

            (A) a report from each military department on the expenditures, work, and accomplishments of that department;

            (B) itemized statements showing the savings of public funds, and the eliminations of unnecessary duplications, made under sections 125 and 191 of this title; and

            (C) such recommendations as he considers appropriate.

        (2) At the same time that the Secretary submits the annual report under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall transmit to the President and Congress a separate report from the Reserve Forces Policy Board on any reserve component matter that the Reserve Forces Policy Board considers appropriate to include in the report.

    (d) Unless specifically prohibited by law, the Secretary may, without being relieved of his responsibility, perform any of his functions or duties, or exercise any of his powers through, or with the aid of, such persons in, or organizations of, the Department of Defense as he may designate.

    (e)

        (1)

         The Secretary shall include in his annual report to Congress under subsection (c)—

            (A) a description of the major military missions and of the military force structure of the United States for the next fiscal year;

            (B) an explanation of the relationship of those military missions to that force structure; and

            (C) the justification for those military missions and that force structure.

        (2) In preparing the matter referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into consideration the content of the annual national security strategy report of the President under section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947 ([50 U.S.C. 3043][/us/usc/t50/s3043]) for the fiscal year concerned.

    (f) When a vacancy occurs in an office within the Department of Defense and the office is to be filled by a person appointed from civilian life by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense shall inform the President of the qualifications needed by a person serving in that office to carry out effectively the duties and responsibilities of that office.

    (g)

        (1)

         The Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall provide annually to the heads of Department of Defense components written policy guidance for the preparation and review of the program recommendations and budget proposals of their respective components. Such guidance shall include guidance on—

            (A) national security objectives and policies;

            (B) the priorities of military missions; and

            (C) the resource levels projected to be available for the period of time for which such recommendations and proposals are to be effective.

        (2) The Secretary of Defense, with the approval of the President and after consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall provide to the Chairman written policy guidance for the preparation and review of contingency plans, including plans for providing support to civil authorities in an incident of national significance or a catastrophic incident, for homeland defense, and for military support to civil authorities. Such guidance shall be provided every two years or more frequently as needed and shall include guidance on the specific force levels and specific supporting resource levels projected to be available for the period of time for which such plans are to be effective.

        (3) At the time of the budget submission by the President for a fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall include in the budget materials submitted to Congress for that year summaries of the guidance developed under paragraphs (1) and (2), as well as summaries of any plans developed in accordance with the guidance developed under paragraph (2). Such summaries shall be sufficient to allow the congressional defense committees to evaluate fully the requirements for military forces, acquisition programs, and operation and maintenance funding in the President’s annual budget request for the Department of Defense.

    (h) The Secretary of Defense shall keep the Secretaries of the military departments informed with respect to military operations and activities of the Department of Defense that directly affect their respective responsibilities.

            (D) reflect, in the overall assessment and in the strategic and regional assessments, the defense capabilities and programs of the armed forces of the United States specified in the budget submitted to Congress under [section 1105 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105] in the year in which the report is submitted and in the five-year defense program submitted in such year; and

            (E) identify the deficiencies in the defense capabilities of the armed forces of the United States in such budget and such five-year defense program.

        (3) The Secretary shall transmit to Congress the report required for each year under paragraph (1) at the same time that the President submits the budget to Congress under [section 1105 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105] in that year. Such report shall be transmitted in both classified and unclassified form.

    (j)

        (1)

         Not later than April 8 of each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a report on the cost of stationing United States forces outside of the United States. Each such report shall include a detailed statement of the following:

        (2) In this subsection, the term “United States”, when used in a geographic sense, includes the territories and possessions of the United States.

    (k) The Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall provide annually to the Secretaries of the military departments and to the commanders of the combatant commands written guidelines to direct the effective detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime threats to the national security of the United States. Those guidelines shall include guidance on the specific force levels and specific supporting resources to be made available for the period of time for which the guidelines are to be in effect.

    (l)

        (1)

         The Secretary shall include in the annual report to Congress under subsection (c) the following:

            (A) A comparison of the amounts provided in the defense budget for support and for mission activities for each of the preceding five fiscal years.

            (B)

             A comparison of the following for each of the preceding five fiscal years:

                (i) The number of military personnel, shown by major occupational category, assigned to support positions or to mission positions.

                (ii) The number of civilian personnel, shown by major occupational category, assigned to support positions or to mission positions.

                (iii) The number of contractor personnel performing support functions.

        (2) Contractor personnel shall be determined for purposes of paragraph (1) by using contractor full-time equivalents, based on the inventory required under [section 2330a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2330a].

    (m)  __Information To Accompany Funding Request for Contingency Operation__  __.—__ 

    Whenever the President submits to Congress a request for appropriations for costs associated with a contingency operation that involves, or likely will involve, the deployment of more than 500 members of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the objectives of the operation. The report shall include a discussion of the following:

        (1) What clear and distinct objectives guide the activities of United States forces in the operation.

        (2) What the President has identified on the basis of those objectives as the date, or the set of conditions, that defines the endpoint of the operation.

    In subsection (a), the last sentence is substituted for [5 U.S.C. 171a(a)][/us/usc/t5/s171a/a] (proviso).

    In subsection (c), the words “during the period covered by the report” are inserted for clarity. The following substitutions are made: “under [section 125 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s125]” for “pursuant to the provisions of this Act” since 125 of this title relates to the duty of the Secretary of Defense to take action to save public funds and to eliminate duplication in the Department of Defense; and the last 22 words of clause (3) for [5 U.S.C. 171a–1][/us/usc/t5/s171a–1] (last 13 words).

 __1988__  __Act__ 

    Subsection (k) is based on [Pub. L. 100–202][/us/pl/100/202], § 101(b) \[title VIII, § 8042\], [101 Stat. 1329–69][/us/stat/101/1329-69].

    Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act ([Public Law 100–202][/us/pl/100/202]) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as [section 113(k) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s113/k], the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.

    The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100–235) states that this new annual report “should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years” (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.

    In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term “United States troops” in the source law to “United States forces” for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed “overseas” to “outside the United States” and defined “United States” for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term “overseas” read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states “For the purposes of this report \[meaning the new DOD annual report\], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.”. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures “overseas” and costs incurred “overseas” are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.

    Proc. No. 8829, May 25, 2012, 77 F.R. 32875, provided:

    As we observe the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, we reflect with solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor. We pay tribute to the more than 3 million servicemen and women who left their families to serve bravely, a world away from everything they knew and everyone they loved. From Ia Drang to Khe Sanh, from Hue to Saigon and countless villages in between, they pushed through jungles and rice paddies, heat and monsoon, fighting heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans. Through more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of our Armed Forces.

    As a grateful Nation, we honor more than 58,000 patriots—their names etched in black granite—who sacrificed all they had and all they would ever know. We draw inspiration from the heroes who suffered unspeakably as prisoners of war, yet who returned home with their heads held high. We pledge to keep faith with those who were wounded and still carry the scars of war, seen and unseen. With more than 1,600 of our service members still among the missing, we pledge as a Nation to do everything in our power to bring these patriots home. In the reflection of The Wall, we see the military family members and veterans who carry a pain that may never fade. May they find peace in knowing their loved ones endure, not only in medals and memories, but in the hearts of all Americans, who are forever grateful for their service, valor, and sacrifice.

    In recognition of a chapter in our Nation’s history that must never be forgotten, let us renew our sacred commitment to those who answered our country’s call in Vietnam and those who awaited their safe return. Beginning on Memorial Day 2012, the Federal Government will partner with local governments, private organizations, and communities across America to participate in the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War—a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to a generation of proud Americans who saw our country through one of the most challenging missions we have ever faced. While no words will ever be fully worthy of their service, nor any honor truly befitting their sacrifice, let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor. Let us renew our commitment to the fullest possible accounting for those who have not returned. Throughout this Commemoration, let us strive to live up to their example by showing our Vietnam veterans, their families, and all who have served the fullest respect and support of a grateful Nation.

    In January of this year the Department of Defense signed a new Host Nation Support Agreement with the Government of Japan in which that government agreed to pay all utility and Japanese labor costs incrementally over the next five years (worth $1.7 billion). Because United States forward deployed forces stationed in Japan have regional missions in addition to the defense of Japan, we did not seek to have the Government of Japan offset all of the direct costs incurred by the United States related to the presence of all United States military personnel in Japan (excluding military personnel title costs).
