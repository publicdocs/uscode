                (i) the blood alcohol content limit under the law of the State in which the conduct occurred, except as may be provided under paragraph (2) for conduct on a military installation that is in more than one State; or

                (ii) the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3).

            (B) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel outside the United States, the applicable blood alcohol content limit is the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3) or such lower limit as the Secretary of Defense may by regulation prescribe.

        (2) In the case of a military installation that is in more than one State, if those States have different blood alcohol content limits under their respective State laws, the Secretary may select one such blood alcohol content limit to apply uniformly on that installation.

        (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the blood alcohol content limit with respect to alcohol concentration in a person’s blood is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood and with respect to alcohol concentration in a person’s breath is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, as shown by chemical analysis.
