        (2) Transitional compensation with respect to a member shall be paid for a period of not less than 12 months and not more than 36 months, as established in policies prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

        (3) If compensation is paid under this section to a child or children pursuant to subsection (d)(2) or (d)(3), such compensation shall be paid in equal shares, with the amount of such compensation for any month determined in accordance with the rates in effect for that month under [section 1313 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1313].

        (3) In a case in which the victim of the dependent-abuse offense resulting in a punitive or other adverse action described in subsection (b) was a dependent child, the Secretary concerned may not pay compensation under this section to a spouse or former spouse who would otherwise be eligible to receive such compensation if the Secretary determines (under regulations prescribed under subsection (k)) that the spouse or former spouse was an active participant in the conduct constituting the dependent-abuse offense.

    (h)  __Effect of Continuation of Military Pay__  __.—__ 

    In the case of payment of transitional compensation by reason of a total forfeiture of pay and allowances pursuant to a sentence of a court-martial, payment of transitional compensation shall not be made for any period for which an order—

        (2) If a dependent or former dependent eligible or entitled to use commissary and exchange stores under paragraph (1) is eligible or entitled to use commissary and exchange stores under another provision of law, the eligibility or entitlement of that dependent or former dependent to use commissary and exchange stores shall be determined under such other provision of law rather than under paragraph (1).

        (2) Regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall include the criminal offenses, or categories of offenses, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of this title), Federal criminal law, the criminal laws of the States and other jurisdictions of the United States, and the laws of other nations that are to be considered to be dependent-abuse offenses for the purposes of this section.

    (l)  __Dependent Child Defined__  __.—__

        (1) who is under 18 years of age;

        (2) who is 18 years of age or older and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity that existed before the age of 18 and who is (or, at the time a punitive or other adverse action was executed in the case of the former member as described in subsection (b), was) dependent on the former member for over one-half of the child’s support; or

        (3) who is 18 years of age or older but less than 23 years of age, is enrolled in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher learning approved by the Secretary of Defense and who is (or, at the time a punitive or other adverse action was executed in the case of the former member as described in subsection (b), was) dependent on the former member for over one-half of the child’s support.

    (m)  __Exceptional Eligibility for Dependents of Former Members__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary concerned, under regulations prescribed under subsection (k), may authorize eligibility for benefits under this section for dependents and former dependents of a former member of the armed forces in a case in which the dependents or former dependents are not otherwise eligible for such benefits and the Secretary concerned determines that the former member engaged in conduct that is a dependent-abuse offense under this section and the former member was separated from active duty other than as described in subsection (b).

        (2) In a case in which the Secretary concerned, under the authority of paragraph (1), authorizes benefits to be provided under this section, such benefits shall be provided in the same manner as if the former member were an individual described in subsection (b), except that, under regulations prescribed under subsection (k), the Secretary shall make such adjustments to the commencement and duration of payment provisions of subsection (e), and may make adjustments to other provisions of this section, as the Secretary considers necessary in light of the circumstances in order to provide benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided in the case of an individual described in subsection (b).

        (3) The authority of the Secretary concerned under paragraph (1) may not be delegated.
