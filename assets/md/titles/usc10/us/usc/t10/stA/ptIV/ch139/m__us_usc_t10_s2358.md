(d) relating to additional provisions applicable to cooperative agreements.

    1993—[Pub. L. 103–160][/us/pl/103/160] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows:

    “(a) In General.—Subject to approval by the President, the Secretary of Defense may engage in basic and applied research projects that are necessary to the responsibilities of the Department of Defense in the field of basic and applied research and development and that relate to weapons systems and other military needs. Subject to approval by the President, the Secretary may perform assigned research and development projects—

    “(1) by contract with, or by grant to, educational or research institutions, private businesses, or other agencies of the United States;

    “(2) through one or more of the military departments; or

    “(3) by using employees and consultants of the Department of Defense.

    “(b) Requirement of Potential Military Relationship.—Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be used to finance any research project or study unless the project or study has, in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, a potential relationship to a military function or operation.”

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–370][/us/pl/100/370] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, struck out “or his designee” after “Secretary of Defense” and “President, the Secretary”, and added subsec. (b).
