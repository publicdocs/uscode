## § 871. Art. 71. Execution of sentence; suspension of sentence

    (a) If the sentence of the court-martial extends to death, that part of the sentence providing for death may not be executed until approved by the President. In such a case, the President may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part thereof, as he sees fit. That part of the sentence providing for death may not be suspended.

    (b) If in the case of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, the sentence of a court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of the sentence providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by the Secretary concerned or such Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned. In such a case, the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part of the sentence, as he sees fit. In time of war or national emergency he may commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the duration of the war or emergency and six months thereafter.

    (c)

        (1)

         If a sentence extends to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge and if the right of the accused to appellate review is not waived, and an appeal is not withdrawn, under [section 861 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s861] (article 61), that part of the sentence extending to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may not be executed until there is a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings (and with respect to death or dismissal, approval under subsection (a) or (b), as appropriate). A judgment as to legality of the proceedings is final in such cases when review is completed by a Court of Criminal Appeals and—

            (A) the time for the accused to file a petition for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has expired and the accused has not filed a timely petition for such review and the case is not otherwise under review by that Court;

            (B) such a petition is rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; or

            (C)

             review is completed in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and—

                (i) a petition for a writ of certiorari is not filed within the time limits prescribed by the Supreme Court;

                (ii) such a petition is rejected by the Supreme Court; or

                (iii) review is otherwise completed in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.

        (2) If a sentence extends to dismissal or a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge and if the right of the accused to appellate review is waived, or an appeal is withdrawn, under [section 861 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s861] (article 61), that part of the sentence extending to dismissal or a bad-conduct or dishonorable discharge may not be executed until review of the case by a judge advocate (and any action on that review) under [section 864 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s864] (article 64) is completed. Any other part of a court-martial sentence may be ordered executed by the convening authority or other person acting on the case under [section 860 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s860] (article 60) when approved by him under that section.

    (d) The convening authority or other person acting on the case under [section 860 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s860] (article 60) may suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof, except a death sentence. Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subsection (c) of [section 860 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s860] (article 60) shall apply to any decision by the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section to suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof under this subsection.
