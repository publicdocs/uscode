    In subsection (a), the word “pay” is substituted for the words “basic pay (plus special and incentive pays)”, since the word “pay”, as defined in [section 101(27) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/27], includes those types of pay. Clause (1) is inserted to reflect [section 1475(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1475/a/1]. Clauses (2) and (3) are substituted for 38:1101(6)(B) (last 32 words of 1st sentence). Clause 4 is substituted for 38:1101(10)(B). The words “to the pay prescribed by section 4385(c) or 9385(c) of this title” are inserted to reflect those sections, which prescribe the training pay of members of reserve officers’ training corps units. Clause (5) is substituted for 38:1101(11)(E) (last 27 words). Clause (6) is substituted for 38:1133(d). In clause (6), the word “pay” is substituted for the words “basic pay (plus special and incentive pays)”, since the word “pay”, as defined in [section 101(27) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/27], includes those kinds of pay. Clauses (7) and (8) are substituted for 38:1134(c). In those clauses, the words “active duty for training” are omitted as covered by the definition of “active duty” in [section 101(22) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/22]. In clause (8), the words “and who became entitled to basic pay” are substituted for the words “and is placed in a pay status” and the words “is entitled to that pay” are substituted for the words “remains in a pay status”.

In subsection (b), the words “on or after January 1, 1957” are omitted as executed. The words “(other than for training)” are inserted, since the words “active duty” in the source statute did not include active duty for training. The words “is considered to continue on that duty” are substituted for the words “shall be deemed to continue on active duty”. The last sentence is substituted for 38:1101(12) (last 14 words).
