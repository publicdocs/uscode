     The Secretary of the military department concerned, with respect to practical military training prescribed under this section and field training and practice cruises prescribed under [section 2104(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2104/b/6], may—

        (1) transport members of, and designated applicants for membership in, the program to and from the places designated for such training or practice cruises and furnish them subsistence while traveling to and from those places, or, instead of furnishing them transportation and subsistence, pay them a travel allowance at the rate prescribed for cadets and midshipmen at the United States Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies for travel by the shortest usually traveled route from the places from which they are authorized to proceed to the place designated for the training or cruise and return, and pay the allowance for the return trip in advance;

        (2) furnish medical attendance and supplies to members of, and designated applicants for membership in, the program while attending such training and practice cruises, and admit them to military hospitals;

        (3) furnish subsistence, uniform clothing, and equipment to members of, and designated applicants for membership in, the program while attending such training or practice cruises or, instead of furnishing uniform clothing, pay them allowances at such rates as he may prescribe; and

        (4) use any member of, and designated applicants for membership in, an armed force, or any employee of the department, under his jurisdiction, and such property of the United States as he considers necessary, for the training and administration of members of, and designated applicants for membership in, the program at the places designated for training or practice cruises.

    (c)

        (1)

         A person who is not qualified for, and (as determined by the Secretary concerned) will not be able to become qualified for, advanced training by reason of one or more of the requirements prescribed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of [section 2104(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2104/b] shall not be permitted to participate in—

            (A) field training or a practice cruise under [section 2104(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2104/b/6]; or

            (B) practical military training under subsection (a).

        (2) The Secretary of the military department concerned may waive the limitation in paragraph (1) under procedures prescribed by the Secretary. Such procedures shall ensure uniform application of limitations and restrictions without regard to the reason for disqualification for advanced training.
