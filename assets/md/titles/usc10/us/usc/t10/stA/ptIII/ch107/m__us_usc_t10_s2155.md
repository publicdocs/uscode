            (A) so as to adequately prepare students to perform effectively in an assignment to a joint, multiservice organization; and

            (B) so that students progress from a basic knowledge of joint matters learned in Phase I instruction to the level of expertise necessary for successful performance in the joint arena.

    (c)  __Curriculum Content__  __.—__ 

    In addition to the subjects specified in [section 2151(a) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2151/a], the curriculum for Phase II joint professional military education shall include the following:

        (1) the percentage of students enrolled in any such course who are officers of the armed force that administers the school may not exceed 60 percent, with the remaining services proportionally represented; and

        (2) of the faculty at the school who are active-duty officers who provide instruction in such courses, the percentage who are officers of the armed force that administers the school may not exceed 60 percent, with the remaining services proportionally represented.
