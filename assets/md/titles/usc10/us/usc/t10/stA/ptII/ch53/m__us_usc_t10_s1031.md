    The words “(including the reserve component)” are omitted, since the words “any component of an armed force” include the reserve components. The words “any oath required for the enlistment or appointment of any person” are substituted for the words “the oath required for the enlistment of any person, the oath required for the appointment of any person to commissioned or warrant officer grade, and any other oath required by law in connection with the enlistment or appointment of any person”.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–364][/us/pl/109/364] substituted “The President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense, any commissioned officer, and any other person designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense may administer any oath” for “Any commissioned officer of any component of an armed force, whether or not on active duty, may administer any oath” in introductory provisions.
