            (B) The authority in this section does not apply to sales of articles and services by a working-capital funded Army industrial facility (including a Department of the Army arsenal) that manufactures large caliber cannons, gun mounts, recoil mechanisms, ammunition, munitions, or components thereof, which are governed by regulations required by [section 4543 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s4543].

    (c)  __Conditions for Sales__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         A sale of articles or services may be made under this section only if—

            (A) the Secretary of Defense determines that the articles or services are not available from a commercial source in the United States;

            (B) the purchaser agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the United States, except as provided in paragraph (3), from any claim for damages or injury to any person or property arising out of the articles or services;

            (F) the sale of the goods and services is made on the basis that it will not interfere with performance of work by the industrial facility concerned for the Department of Defense.

        (2) The Secretary of Defense may waive the condition in paragraph (1)(A) and subsection (a)(1) that an article or service must be not available from a United States commercial source in the case of a particular sale if the Secretary determines that the waiver is necessary for reasons of national security and notifies Congress regarding the reasons for the waiver.

        (3) Paragraph (1)(B) does not apply in any case of willful misconduct or gross negligence or in the case of a claim by a purchaser of articles or services under this section that damages or injury arose from the failure of the Government to comply with quality, schedule, or cost performance requirements in the contract to provide the articles or services.

    (d)  __Methods of Sale__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall permit a purchaser of articles or services under this section to use advance incremental funding to pay for the articles or services.

            (C) develop and maintain (from sources other than appropriated funds) working capital to be available for paying design costs, planning costs, procurement costs, and other costs associated with the articles or services sold.

    (e)  __Deposit of Proceeds__  __.—__ 

    Proceeds from sales of articles and services under this section shall be credited to the funds, including working capital funds and operation and maintenance funds, incurring the costs of manufacture or performance.

    (f)  __Relationship to Arms Export Control Act__  __.—__
