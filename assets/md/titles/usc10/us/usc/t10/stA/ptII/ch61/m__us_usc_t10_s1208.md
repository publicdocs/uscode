    In subsection (a), the words “shall be credited with the service described in clause (1) or that described in clause (2), whichever is greater” are substituted for the words “shall be interpreted to mean”.

    In subsection (a)(1), the words “he is considered to have” are substituted for the words “such member, former member, or person has or is deemed to have pursuant to law”.

    In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words “his active service” are substituted for the words “while on the active list or on active duty or while participating in full-time training or other full-time duty provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended, or in—other provisions of law” because of the definitions of “active service” and “active duty” in sections 101(24) and 101(22) of this title.

In subsection (a)(2)(C), the references to 10:22–23, 24–26, and 30–36 are omitted as repealed by section 401 of the Army Organization Act of 1950, [64 Stat. 271][/us/stat/64/271]. The reference to 32:70 is omitted as repealed by [section 16 of the act of June 15, 1933, ch. 87][/us/act/1933-06-15/ch87/s16], [48 Stat. 159][/us/stat/48/159].

The references to 32:144–147, 171, and 176 are omitted, since they deal with pay and do not authorize duty or training. The reference to [section 502 of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s502], not contained in 37:282, is inserted, since section 92 of the National Defense Act, as amended (32:62) is referred to in section 412 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37:282).

    In subsection (b), the words “any other member” are substituted for the words “members of the reserve components”, since the words “reserve components” are defined by section 102(k) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 805][/us/stat/63/805] ([37 U.S.C. 231(k)][/us/usc/t37/s231/k]) to include members appointed, enlisted, or inducted without component.

(2)(C), substituted “as a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes active service as a member of the Environmental Science Services Administration and” for “as a member of the Environmental Science Services Administration includes service as a member”.

    1966—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 89–718][/us/pl/89/718] substituted “Environmental Science Services Administration” for “Coast and Geodetic Survey” in clause (2)(B) and inserted provision that, for purposes of clause (2)(B) of subsec. (a), active service as a member of the Environmental Science Services Administration includes active service as a member of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
