## § 1122. Medal for Merit: award

    The President, under regulations to be prescribed by him, may award a decoration called the “Medal for Merit”, having distinctive appurtenances and devices and only one degree, to any civilian of any nation prosecuting the war in existence on July 20, 1942, under the joint declaration of the United Nations, as then constituted, or of any other friendly foreign nation, who, after September 8, 1939, has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious conduct in performing outstanding services. The Medal for Merit may be awarded to a civilian of a foreign nation but only for performing an exceptionally meritorious or courageous act in the furtherance of the war efforts of the United Nations as then constituted.

    The words “in existence on July 20, 1942” are inserted for clarity and refer to the war in existence on the date of enactment of the source statute. The words “as then constituted” are inserted for clarity, since the United Nations organization in existence on July 20, 1942, was not the present United Nations organization. The words “There is created”, “rules and”, and “the proclamation of an emergency by the President on” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Ex. Ord. No. 9637. Medal for Merit__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 9637, Oct. 3, 1945, 10 F.R. 12543, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 9857A, May 27, 1947, 12 F.R. 3583, provided:

    1. The decoration of the Medal for Merit shall be awarded only by the President of the United States or at his direction.

Awards of the Medal for Merit made to civilians of foreign nations shall be for the performance of an exceptionally meritorious or courageous act or acts in furtherance of the war efforts of the United Nations.

    2. There is hereby established the Medal for Merit Board, which shall be composed of three members appointed by the President, one of whom shall be designated by the President to act as Chairman of the Board.

    3. The Medal for Merit Board shall receive and consider proposals for the award of the decoration of the Medal for Merit and submit to the President the recommendations of the Board with respect thereto. In the case of proposed awards to civilians of foreign nations, such recommendations shall include the recommendations of the Secretary of State.

    4. The Medal for Merit Board is authorized to prescribe, with the approval of the President, such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this order as may be necessary to accomplish its purposes.

    5. Executive Order 9331 of April 19, 1943 and the Medal for Merit Board created thereby, are superseded by this order.

    6. The Medal for Merit shall not be awarded for any services relating to the prosecution of World War II performed subsequent to the cessation of hostilities, as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 2714 of December 31, 1946, and no proposal for an award for such services submitted after June 30, 1947, shall be considered by the Medal for Merit Board.
