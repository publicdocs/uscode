    (a) __Automatic Referral for Appellate Review.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b), in each case in which the final decision of a military commission under this chapter (as approved by the convening authority) includes a finding of guilty, the convening authority shall refer the case to the United States Court of Military Commission Review. Any such referral shall be made in accordance with procedures prescribed under regulations of the Secretary.

    (b) __Waiver of Right of Review.—__ 

        (1) Except in a case in which the sentence as approved under [section 950b of this title][/us/usc/t10/s950b] extends to death, an accused may file with the convening authority a statement expressly waiving the right of the accused to appellate review by the United States Court of Military Commission Review under [section 950f of this title][/us/usc/t10/s950f] of the final decision of the military commission under this chapter.

        (2) A waiver under paragraph (1) shall be signed by both the accused and a defense counsel.

The convening authority, for good cause, may extend the period for such filing by not more than 30 days.
