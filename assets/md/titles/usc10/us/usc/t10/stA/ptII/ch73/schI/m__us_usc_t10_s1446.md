     Notwithstanding [section 1441 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1441], if a person—

        (1) has made an election under this subchapter; and

        (2) is retired for physical disability before he completes 19 years of service for which he is entitled to credit in the computation of his basic pay;

        and thereafter dies, his beneficiaries are not entitled to the annuities provided under this subchapter until they give proof to the department concerned that they are not eligible for benefits under chapter 11 or 13 of title 38. If the beneficiaries are not eligible for benefits under chapter 11 or 13 of title 38, the annuity shall begin on the first day of the month in which the death occurs.

    (b) Whenever the beneficiaries on whose behalf the election was made are restricted, under subsection (a), from participating in the annuities provided under this subchapter, the amount withheld from the elector’s retired or retainer pay as a result of an election under this subchapter shall be refunded to the beneficiaries, less the amount of any annuities paid under this subchapter, and in either case without interest.
