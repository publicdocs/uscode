## § 824. Art. 24. Who may convene summary courts-martial

    (a)

     Summary courts-martial may be convened by—

        (1) any person who may convene a general or special court-martial;

        (2) the commanding officer of a detached company, or other detachment of the Army;

        (3) the commanding officer of a detached squadron or other detachment of the Air Force; or

        (4) the commanding officer or officer in charge of any other command when empowered by the Secretary concerned.

    (b) When only one commissioned officer is present with a command or detachment he shall be the summary court-martial of that command or detachment and shall hear and determine all summary court-martial cases brought before him. Summary courts-martial may, however, be convened in any case by superior competent authority when considered desirable by him.
