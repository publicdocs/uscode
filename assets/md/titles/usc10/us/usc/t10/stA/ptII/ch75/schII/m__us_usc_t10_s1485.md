## § 1485. Dependents of members of armed forces

    (a) The Secretary concerned may, if a dependent of a member of an armed force dies while the member is on active duty (other than for training), provide for, and pay the necessary expenses of, transporting the remains of the deceased dependent to the home of the decedent or to any other place that the Secretary determines to be the appropriate place of interment.

    (b) The Secretary may furnish mortuary services and supplies, on a reimbursable basis, for persons covered by subsection (a), if (1) that action is practicable, and (2) local commercial mortuary services and supplies are not available or the Secretary believes that their cost is prohibitive.

    (c) Reimbursement for mortuary services and supplies furnished under this section shall be collected and credited to appropriations available, at the time of reimbursement, for those services and supplies.
