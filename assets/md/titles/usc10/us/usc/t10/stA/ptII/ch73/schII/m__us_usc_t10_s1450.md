## § 1450. Payment of annuity: beneficiaries

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    Effective as of the first day after the death of a person to whom [section 1448 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448] applies (or on such other day as that person may provide under subsection (j)), a monthly annuity under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1451] shall be paid to the person’s beneficiaries under the Plan, as follows:

        (1)  __Surviving spouse or former spouse__  __.—__ 

        The eligible surviving spouse or the eligible former spouse.

        (2)  __Surviving children__  __.—__ 

        The surviving dependent children in equal shares, if the eligible surviving spouse or the eligible former spouse is dead, dies, or otherwise becomes ineligible under this section.

        (3)  __Dependent children__  __.—__ 

        The dependent children in equal shares if the person to whom [section 1448 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448] applies (with the concurrence of the person’s spouse, if required under [section 1448(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/a/3]) elected to provide an annuity for dependent children but not for the spouse or former spouse.

        (4)  __Natural person designated under “insurable interest” coverage__  __.—__ 

        The natural person designated under [section 1448(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/b/1], unless the election to provide an annuity to the natural person has been changed as provided in subsection (f).

    (b)  __Termination of Annuity for Death, Remarriage Before Age__  __55, Etc.—__ 

        (1)  __General rule__  __.—__ 

        An annuity payable to the beneficiary terminates effective as of the first day of the month in which eligibility is lost.

        (2)  __Termination of spouse annuity upon death or remarriage before age 55__  __.—__ 

        An annuity for a surviving spouse or former spouse shall be paid to the surviving spouse or former spouse while the surviving spouse or former spouse is living or, if the surviving spouse or former spouse remarries before reaching age 55, until the surviving spouse or former spouse remarries.

        (3)  __Effect of termination of subsequent marriage before age 55__  __.—__ 

        If the surviving spouse or former spouse remarries before reaching age 55 and that marriage is terminated by death, annulment, or divorce, payment of the annuity shall be resumed effective as of the first day of the month in which the marriage is so terminated. However, if the surviving spouse or former spouse is also entitled to an annuity under the Plan based upon the marriage so terminated, the surviving spouse or former spouse may not receive both annuities but must elect which to receive.

    (c) __Offset for Amount of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.—__ 

        (1)  __Required offset__  __.—__ 

        If, upon the death of a person to whom [section 1448 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448] applies, the surviving spouse or former spouse of that person is also entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation under [section 1311(a) of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1311/a], the surviving spouse or former spouse may be paid an annuity under this section, but only in the amount that the annuity otherwise payable under this section would exceed that compensation.

        (2)  __Effective date of offset__  __.—__ 

        A reduction in an annuity under this section required by paragraph (1) shall be effective on the date of the commencement of the period of payment of such dependency and indemnity compensation under title 38.

        (3)  __Limitation on recoupment of offset amount__  __.—__ 

        Any amount subject to offset under this subsection that was previously paid to the surviving spouse or former spouse shall be recouped only to the extent that the amount paid exceeds any amount to be refunded under subsection (e). In notifying a surviving spouse or former spouse of the recoupment requirement, the Secretary shall provide the spouse or former spouse—

            (A) a single notice of the net amount to be recouped or the net amount to be refunded, as applicable, under this subsection or subsection (e);

            (B) a written explanation of the statutory requirements for recoupment of the offset amount and for refund of any applicable amount deducted from retired pay;

            (C) a detailed accounting of how the offset amount being recouped and retired pay deduction amount being refunded were calculated; and

            (D) contact information for a person who can provide information about the offset recoupment and retired pay deduction refund processes and answer questions the surviving spouse or former spouse may have about the requirements, processes, or amounts.

    (d)  __Limitation on Payment of Annuities When Coverage Under Civil Service Retirement Elected__  __.—__ 

    If, upon the death of a person to whom [section 1448 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448] applies, that person had in effect a waiver of that person’s retired pay for the purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or chapter 84 of such title, an annuity under this section shall not be payable unless, in accordance with section 8339(j) or 8416(a) of title 5, that person notified the Office of Personnel Management that he did not desire any spouse surviving him to receive an annuity under section 8341(b) or 8442(a) of that title.

    (e) __Refund of Amounts Deducted From Retired Pay When DIC Offset Is Applicable.—__ 

        (1)  __Full refund when dic greater than sbp annuity__  __.—__ 

        If an annuity under this section is not payable because of subsection (c), any amount deducted from the retired pay of the deceased under [section 1452 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1452] shall be refunded to the surviving spouse or former spouse.

        (2)  __Partial refund when sbp annuity reduced by dic__  __.—__ 

        If, because of subsection (c), the annuity payable is less than the amount established under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1451], the annuity payable shall be recalculated under that section. The amount of the reduction in the retired pay required to provide that recalculated annuity shall be computed under [section 1452 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1452], and the difference between the amount deducted before the computation of that recalculated annuity and the amount that would have been deducted on the basis of that recalculated annuity shall be refunded to the surviving spouse or former spouse.

    (f) __Change in Election of Insurable Interest or Former Spouse Beneficiary.—__ 

        (1) __Authorized changes.—__ 

            (A)  __Election in favor of spouse or child__  __.—__

            (C)  __Procedures, effective date, etc__  __.—__ 

            Any such change of election is subject to the same rules with respect to execution, revocation, and effectiveness as are set forth in [section 1448(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/a/5] (without regard to the eligibility of the person making the change of election to make such an election under that section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of election under this subsection to provide an annuity to a spouse instead of a former spouse may (subject to paragraph (2)) be made at any time after the person providing the annuity remarries without regard to the time limitation in [section 1448(a)(5)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/a/5/B].

            (B)  __Persons required to make election__  __.—__ 

            A person shall be considered for purposes of subparagraph (A) to be required to elect under [section 1448(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1448/b] to provide an annuity to a former spouse if—

>     Effective on the first day of each month specified in paragraph (2)—

>         “(A) each annuity under [section 1450 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s1450], United States Code, that commenced before that month, is computed under a provision of section 1451 of that title amended by subsection (a), and is payable for that month shall be recomputed so as to be equal to the amount that would be in effect if the percent applicable for that month under that provision, as so amended, had been used for the initial computation of the annuity; and

>         “(B) each supplemental survivor annuity under \[former\] section 1457 of such title that commenced before that month and is payable for that month shall be recomputed so as to be equal to the amount that would be in effect if the percent applicable for that month under that section, as amended by this section, had been used for the initial computation of the supplemental survivor annuity.

    \[[Pub. L. 110–417][/us/pl/110/417], \[div. A\], title VI, § 632, Oct. 14, 2008, [122 Stat. 4493][/us/stat/122/4493], provided that the amendment made by that section to [section 644(c) of Pub.
