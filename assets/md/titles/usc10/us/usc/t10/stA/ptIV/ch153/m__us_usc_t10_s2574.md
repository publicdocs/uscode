## § 2574. Armament: sale of individual pieces

    A piece of armament that can be advantageously replaced, and that is not needed for its historical value, may be sold by the military department having jurisdiction over it for not less than cost, if the Secretary concerned considers that there are adequate sentimental reasons for the sale.
