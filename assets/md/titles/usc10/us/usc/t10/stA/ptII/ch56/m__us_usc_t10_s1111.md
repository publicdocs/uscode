        (3) The term “medicare-eligible”, with respect to any person, means entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1395c][/us/usc/t42/s1395c] et seq.).

        (4) The term “participating uniformed service” means the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and any other uniformed service that is covered by an agreement entered into under subsection (c).
