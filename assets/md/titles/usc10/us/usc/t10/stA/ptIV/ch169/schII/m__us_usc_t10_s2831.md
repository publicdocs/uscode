        (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a family housing unit used, or intended for use, as quarters for a general officer or flag officer if the unit was identified in the most recent report submitted under subsection (e) and the cost of the maintenance or repair project was included in the total of anticipated operation, maintenance, and repair costs for the unit specified in the report.
