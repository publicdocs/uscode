## § 869. Art. 69. Review in the office of the Judge Advocate General

    (a) The record of trial in each general court-martial that is not otherwise reviewed under [section 866 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866] (article 66) shall be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate review under [section 861 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s861] (article 61). If any part of the findings or sentence is found to be unsupported in law or if reassessment of the sentence is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or set aside the findings or sentence or both.

    (b) The findings or sentence, or both, in a court-martial case not reviewed under subsection (a) or under [section 866 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866] (article 66) may be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, by the Judge Advocate General on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court, lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence. If such a case is considered upon application of the accused, the application must be filed in the office of the Judge Advocate General by the accused on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved under [section 860(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s860/c] (article 60(c)), unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file within that time.

    (c) If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or sentence, he may, except when the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If he sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall order that the charges be dismissed. If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening authority shall dismiss the charges.

    (d)

     A Court of Criminal Appeals may review, under [section 866 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866] (article 66)—

        (1) any court-martial case which (A) is subject to action by the Judge Advocate General under this section, and (B) is sent to the Court of Criminal Appeals by order of the Judge Advocate General; and

        (2) any action taken by the Judge Advocate General under this section in such case.

    (e) Notwithstanding [section 866 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866] (article 66), in any case reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals under this section, the Court may take action only with respect to matters of law.

(a) by striking “[section 867(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s867/b/2] (article 67(b)(2))” in the third sentence and inserting in lieu thereof “[section 867(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s867/a/2] (article 67(a)(2))”, could not be executed because of the intervening amendment by [Pub. L. 101–189][/us/pl/101/189], § 1302(a)(1), which struck out the third sentence, see below.

    [Pub. L. 101–189][/us/pl/101/189], § 1302(a)(1), struck out the third sentence, which read as follows: “If the Judge Advocate General so directs, the record shall be reviewed by a Court of Military Review under [section 866 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s866] (article 66), but in that event there may be no further review by the Court of Military Appeals except under [section 867(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s867/b/2] (article 67(b)(2)).”

    1968—[Pub. L. 90–632][/us/pl/90/632] authorized the Judge Advocate General to either vacate or modify the findings or sentence, or both, in whole or in part, in any court-martial case which has been finally reviewed, but which has not been reviewed by a Court of Military Review, because of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court, lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, or error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused.
