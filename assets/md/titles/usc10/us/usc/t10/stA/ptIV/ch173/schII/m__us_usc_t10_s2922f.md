## § 2922f. Preference for energy efficient electric equipment

    (a) In establishing a new requirement for electric equipment referred to in subsection (b) and in procuring electric equipment referred to in that subsection, the Secretary of a military department or the head of a Defense Agency, as the case may be, shall provide a preference for the procurement of the most energy efficient electric equipment available that meets the requirement or the need for the procurement, if providing such a preference is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department of Defense developed under [section 2911 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2911] and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.

    (b)

     Subsection (a) applies to the following electric equipment:

        (1) Electric lamps.

        (2) Electric ballasts.

        (3) Electric motors.

        (4) Electric refrigeration equipment.

(Added [Pub. L. 102–484, div. A, title III, § 384(a)(1)(A)][/us/pl/102/484/s384/a/1/A], Oct. 23, 1992, [106 Stat. 2392][/us/stat/106/2392], § 2410c; renumbered § 2922f and amended [Pub.

[Pub. L. 102–484, div. A, title III, § 384(b)][/us/pl/102/484/s384/b]–(d), Oct. 23, 1992, [106 Stat. 2393][/us/stat/106/2393], provided that:

>     “(b) __Electric Lighting Demonstration Program.—__ 

>         (1) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a demonstration program for using energy efficient electric lighting equipment.

>         “(2) The Secretary shall designate 50 facilities owned or leased by the Department of Defense for participation in the demonstration program under this subsection.

>         “(3)

>          The head of each facility designated pursuant to paragraph (2) and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency shall jointly audit the electric lighting equipment at the facility in order—

>             “(A) to identify any potential improvements that would increase the energy efficiency of electric lighting at that facility; and

>             “(B) to determine the costs of, and the savings that would result from, such improvements.

>         “(4) Except as provided in subsection (d)(4), on the basis of the results of the audit the head of the facility shall promptly convert to the use of electric lighting equipment at the facility that is more energy efficient than the existing electric lighting equipment to the extent that the conversion is cost effective.

>         “(5) Energy efficient electric lighting equipment used under the demonstration program may include compact fluorescent lamps, energy efficient electric ballasts and fixtures, and other energy efficient electric lighting equipment.

>     “(c) __Refrigeration Equipment Demonstration Program.—__ 

>         (1) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a demonstration program for using energy efficient refrigeration equipment.

>         “(2) The Secretary shall designate 50 facilities owned or operated by the Department of Defense for participation in the demonstration program under this subsection.

>         “(3)

>          The head of each facility designated pursuant to paragraph (2) and the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency shall jointly audit the refrigeration equipment at the facility in order—

>             “(A) to identify any potential improvements that would increase the energy efficiency of the refrigeration equipment at that facility; and

>             “(B) to determine the costs of, and the savings that would result from, such improvements.

>         “(4) Except as provided in subsection (d)(4), on the basis of the results of the audit the head of the facility shall promptly convert to the use of refrigeration equipment at the facility that is more energy efficient than the existing refrigeration equipment to the extent that the conversion is cost effective.

>     “(d) __General Provisions for Demonstration Programs.—__ 

>         (1) The Secretary of Defense shall make the designations under subsections (b)(2) and (c)(2) not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Oct. 23, 1992\].

>         “(2) The Secretary of Defense may designate a facility described in subsections (b)(2) and (c)(2) for participation in the demonstration program under subsection (b) and the demonstration program under subsection (c).
