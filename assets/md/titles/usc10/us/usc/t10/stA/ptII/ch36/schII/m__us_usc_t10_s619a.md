            (B) a chaplain; or

            (C) a judge advocate.

        (5) In the case of an officer who served in a joint duty assignment that began before January 1, 1987, if the officer served in that assignment for a period of sufficient duration (which may not be less than 12 months) for the officer’s service to have been considered a full tour of duty under the policies and regulations in effect on September 30, 1986.

    (c) __Waiver To Be Individual.—__ 

    A waiver may be granted under subsection (b) only on a case-by-case basis in the case of an individual officer.

    (f) __Regulations.—__ 

    The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. The regulations shall specifically identify for purposes of subsection (b)(2) those categories of officers for which selection for promotion to brigadier general or, in the case of the Navy, rear admiral (lower half) is based primarily upon scientific and technical qualifications for which joint requirements do not exist.

    (g) __Limitation for General and Flag Officers Previously Receiving Joint Duty Assignment Waiver.—__ 

    A general officer or flag officer who before January 1, 1999, received a waiver of subsection (a) under the authority of this subsection (as in effect before that date) may not be appointed to the grade of lieutenant general or vice admiral until the officer completes a full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment.
