## § 712. Foreign governments: detail to assist

    (a)

     Upon the application of the country concerned, the President, whenever he considers it in the public interest, may detail members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to assist in military matters—

        (1) any republic in North America, Central America, or South America;

        (2) the Republic of Cuba, Haiti, or Santo Domingo; and

        (3) during a war or a declared national emergency, any other country that he considers it advisable to assist in the interest of national defense.

    (b) Subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of the military department concerned, a member detailed under this section may accept any office from the country to which he is detailed. He is entitled to credit for all service while so detailed, as if serving with the armed forces of the United States. Arrangements may be made by the President, with countries to which such members are detailed to perform functions under this section, for reimbursement to the United States or other sharing of the cost of performing such functions.
