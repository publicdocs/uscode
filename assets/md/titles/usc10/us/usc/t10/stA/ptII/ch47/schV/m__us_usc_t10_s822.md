    Subsection (a)(2) is substituted for the words “the Secretary of a Department”.

    In subsection (a)(4), the words “continental limits of the” are omitted, since [section 101(1) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/1] defines the United States to include the States and the District of Columbia.

    In subsection (a)(6), the words “any other commanding officer” are substituted for the words “such other commanding officers as may be”.

    In subsection (b), the word “If” is substituted for the word “When”. The words “if considered” are substituted for the words “when deemed”.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (a)(5). [Pub. L. 109–163][/us/pl/109/163] struck out “a Territorial Department,” before “an Army Group”.

    1986—Subsec. (a)(2) to (9). [Pub. L. 99–433][/us/pl/99/433] added pars. (2) and (3) and redesignated existing pars. (2) to (7) as (4) to (9), respectively.
