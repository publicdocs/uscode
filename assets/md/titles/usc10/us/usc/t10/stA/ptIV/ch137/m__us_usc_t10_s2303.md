    In subsection (a), the words “all property named in subsection (b), and all services” are substituted for the words “for supplies or services”. The words “(each being hereinafter called the agency)”, are omitted, since the revised sections of this chapter make specific reference to the agencies named in this revised section. The words “United States” before the words “Coast Guard” are omitted, since they are not a part of the official name of the Coast Guard under [section 1 of title 14][/us/usc/t14/s1].

    In subsection (b), the introductory clause is substituted for the word “supplies”. Throughout the revised chapter reference is made to “property or services covered by this chapter”, instead of “supplies”, since the word “supplies” is defined in [section 101(26) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/26] in its usual and narrower sense, rather than the sense of the source statute for this revised chapter. It is desirable to avoid a usage which conflicts with the definition in [section 101(26) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101/26]. The word “ships” and the words “of every character, type, and description”, after the word “vessels”, are omitted as covered by the definition of “vessel” in [section 1 of title 1][/us/usc/t1/s1].

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 98–369][/us/pl/98/369], § 2722(b)(1)(A), (B), substituted in provisions preceding cl. (1) “procurement” for “purchase, and contract to purchase,” and “(other than land) and all services” for “named in subsection (b), and all services,”.

    Subsec. (a)(1) to (6). [Pub. L. 98–369][/us/pl/98/369], § 2722(b)(1)(C), (D), added cl. (1) and redesignated existing cls. (1) to (5) as (2) to (6), respectively.

    Subsecs. (b), (c). [Pub. L. 98–369][/us/pl/98/369], § 2722(b)(2), (3), redesignated subsec. (c) as (b). Former subsec. (b), which had provided that this chapter did not cover land but did cover public works, buildings, facilities, vessels, floating equipment, aircraft, parts, accessories, equipment, and machine tools, was struck out.

    1958—Subsec. (a)(5). [Pub. L. 85–568][/us/pl/85/568] substituted “The National Aeronautics and Space Administration” for “The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics”.

 __Effective Date of 1984 Amendment__

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].

 __Acquisition, Lease, or Rental for Use by the Armed Forces of Motor Buses Manufactured Outside the United States__ 

    [Pub. L. 90–500, title IV][/us/pl/90/500/tIV], § 404, Sept. 20, 1968, [82 Stat. 851][/us/stat/82/851], which provided that no funds for the armed forces were to be used to buy or lease buses other than those manufactured in the United States, except as regulation from the Secretary of Defense might authorize solely to avoid uneconomical procurement or one contrary to the national interest, was repealed and restated as [section 2400 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2400] by [Pub. L. 97–295][/us/pl/97/295], §§ 1(29)(A), 6(b), Oct. 12, 1982, [96 Stat. 1294][/us/stat/96/1294], 1314.
