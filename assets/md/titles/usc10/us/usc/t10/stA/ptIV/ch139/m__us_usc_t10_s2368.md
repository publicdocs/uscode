## § 2368. Centers for Science, Technology, and Engineering Partnership

    (a)  __Designation__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of the military departments, shall designate each science and technology reinvention laboratory as a Center for Science, Technology, and Engineering Partnership (in this section referred to as “Centers”) in the recognized core competencies of the designee.

        (2) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a policy to encourage the Secretary of each military department to reengineer management and business processes and adopt best-business and personnel practices at the Centers of the Secretary concerned in connection with the capability requirements of the Centers, so as to serve as recognized leaders in such capabilities throughout the Department of Defense and in the national technology and industrial base.

        (3)

         The Secretary of Defense, acting through the directors of the Centers, may conduct one or more pilot programs, consistent with applicable requirements of law, to test any practices referred to in paragraph (2) that the Directors determine could—

            (A) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations at Centers;

            (B) improve the support provided by the Centers for the elements of the Department of Defense who use the services of the Centers; and

            (C) enhance capabilities by reducing the cost and improving the performance and efficiency of executing laboratory missions.

    (b)  __Public-private Partnerships__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         To achieve one or more objectives set forth in paragraph (2), the Secretary may authorize and establish incentives for the Director of a Center to enter into public-private cooperative arrangements (in this section referred to as a “public-private partnership”) to provide for any of the following:

            (A)

             For employees of the Center, academia, private industry, State and local governments, or other entities outside the Department of Defense to perform (under contract, subcontract, or otherwise) work related to the capabilities of the Center, including any work that—

                (i) involves one or more capabilities of the Center; and

                (ii) may be applicable to both the Department and commercial entities.

            (B) For private industry or other entities outside the Department of Defense to use for either Government or commercial purposes any capabilities of the Center that are not fully used for Department of Defense activities for any period determined to be consistent with the needs of the Department of Defense.

        (2)

         The objectives for exercising the authority provided in paragraph (1) are as follows:

            (A) To maximize the use of the capacity of a Center.

            (B) To reduce or eliminate the cost of ownership of a Center by the Department of Defense.

            (C) To reduce the cost of science, technology, and engineering activities of the Department of Defense.

            (D)

             To leverage private sector investment in—

                (i) such efforts as research and equipment recapitalization for a Center; and

                (ii) the promotion of the undertaking of commercial business ventures based on the capabilities of a Center, as determined by the director of the Center.

            (E) To foster cooperation and technology transfer between the armed forces, academia, private industry, and State and local governments.

            (F) To increase access by a Center to a skilled technical workforce that can contribute to the effective and efficient execution of the missions of the Department of Defense.

            (G) To increase the ability of a Center to access and use non-Department of Defense methods to develop and innovate and access capabilities that contribute to the effective and efficient execution of the missions of the Department of Defense.
