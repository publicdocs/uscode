        (4) The premiums payable by a member of a reserve component under this subsection may be deducted and withheld from basic pay payable to the member under [section 204 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s204] or from compensation payable to the member under section 206 of such title. The Secretary shall prescribe the requirements and procedures applicable to the payment of premiums.

    In this section:

        (1) The term “immediate family”, with respect to a member of a reserve component, means all of the member’s dependents described in subparagraphs (A), (D), and (I) of [section 1072(2) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1072/2].
