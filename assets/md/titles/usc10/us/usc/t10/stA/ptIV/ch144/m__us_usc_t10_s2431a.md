## § 2431a. Acquisition strategy

    (a)  __Acquisition Strategy Required__  __.—__ 

    There shall be an acquisition strategy for each major defense acquisition program, each major automated information system, and each major system approved by a milestone decision authority.

    (b)  __Responsible Official__  __.—__ 

    For each acquisition strategy required by subsection (a), the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is responsible for issuing and maintaining the requirements for—

        (1) the content of the strategy; and

        (2) the review and approval process for the strategy.

    (c)  __Considerations__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         In issuing requirements for the content of an acquisition strategy for a major defense acquisition program, major automated information system, or major system, the Under Secretary shall ensure that—

            (A) the strategy clearly describes the proposed top-level business and technical management approach for the program or system, in sufficient detail to allow the milestone decision authority to assess the viability of the proposed approach, the method of implementing laws and policies, and program objectives;

            (B) the strategy contains a clear explanation of how the strategy is designed to be implemented with available resources, such as time, funding, and management capacity;

            (C) the strategy is tailored to address program requirements and constraints; and

            (D) the strategy considers the items listed in paragraph (2).

        (2)

         Each strategy shall, where appropriate, consider the following:

            (A) An approach that delivers required capability in increments, each depending on available mature technology, and that recognizes up front the need for future capability improvements.

            (B) Acquisition approach, including industrial base considerations in accordance with [section 2440 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2440].

            (C) Risk management, including such methods as competitive prototyping at the system, subsystem, or component level, in accordance with [section 2431b of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2431b].

            (D) Business strategy, including measures to ensure competition at the system and subsystem level throughout the life-cycle of the program or system in accordance with [section 2337 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2337].

            (E)

             Contracting strategy, including—

                (i) contract type and how the type selected relates to level of program risk in each acquisition phase;

                (ii) how the plans for the program or system to reduce risk enable the use of fixed-price elements in subsequent contracts and the timing of the use of those fixed price elements;

                (iii) market research; and

                (iv) consideration of small business participation.

            (F) Intellectual property strategy in accordance with [section 2320 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2320].

            (G) International involvement, including foreign military sales and cooperative opportunities, in accordance with [section 2350a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2350a].

            (H) Multiyear procurement in accordance with [section 2306b of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2306b].

            (I) Integration of current intelligence assessments into the acquisition process.

            (J) Requirements related to logistics, maintenance, and sustainment in accordance with sections 2464 and 2466 of this title.

    (d)  __Review__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the milestone decision authority shall review and approve, as appropriate, the acquisition strategy for a major defense acquisition program, major automated information system, or major system at each of the following times:

            (A) Milestone A approval.

            (B) The decision to release the request for proposals for development of the program or system.

            (C) Milestone B approval.

            (D) Each subsequent milestone.

            (E) Review of any decision to enter into full-rate production.

            (F)

             When there has been—

                (i) a significant change to the cost of the program or system;

                (ii) a critical change to the cost of the program or system;

                (iii) a significant change to the schedule of the program or system; or

                (iv) a significant change to the performance of the program or system.
