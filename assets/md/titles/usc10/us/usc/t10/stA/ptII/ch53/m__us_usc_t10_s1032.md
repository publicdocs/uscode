        (2) was a result of the relationship of the dependent to the member of the uniformed services.

    (b) Any compensation otherwise payable to a person under this section in connection with any disability or death shall be reduced by any amount payable to such person under any other program funded in whole or in part by the United States in connection with such disability or death, except that nothing in this subsection shall result in the reduction of any amount below zero.

    (c) A determination by the President under subsection (a) is conclusive and is not subject to judicial review.

        (1) The term “dependent” has the meaning given that term in [section 551 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s551].

        (2) The term “Secretary concerned” has the meaning given that term in section 101 of that title.
