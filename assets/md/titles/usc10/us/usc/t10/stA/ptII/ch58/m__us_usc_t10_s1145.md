            (B)

             Assistance provided to a member under paragraph (1) shall include the following:

                (i)

    (b)  __Conversion Health Policies__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary of Defense shall inform each member referred to in subsection (a) before the date of the member’s discharge or release from active duty of the availability for purchase by the member of a conversion health policy for the member and the dependents of that member. A conversion health policy offered under this paragraph shall provide coverage for not less than an 18-month period.

        (2)

         If a member referred to in subsection (a) purchases a conversion health policy during the period applicable to the member (or within a reasonable time after that period as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense), the Secretary shall provide health care, or pay the costs of health care provided, to the member and the dependents of the member—

            (A) during the 18-month period beginning on the date on which coverage under the conversion health policy begins; and

            (B) for a condition (including pregnancy) that exists on such date and for which care is not provided under the policy solely on the grounds that the condition is a preexisting condition.

        (3) The Secretary of Defense may arrange for the provision of health care described in paragraph (2) through a contract with the insurer offering the conversion health policy.

        (4)

         If the Secretary of Defense is unable, within a reasonable time, to enter into a contract with a private insurer to provide the conversion health policy required under paragraph (1) at a rate not to exceed the payment required under [section 8905a(d)(1)(A) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8905a/d/1/A] for comparable coverage, the Secretary shall offer such a policy under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. Subject to paragraph (5), a member purchasing a policy from the Secretary shall be required to pay into the Military Health Care Account or other appropriate account an amount equal to the sum of—

            (A) the individual and Government contributions which would be required in the case of a person enrolled in a health benefits plan contracted for under [section 1079 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1079]; and

            (B) an amount necessary for administrative expenses, but not to exceed two percent of the amount under subparagraph (A).

        (6) In order to reduce premiums required under paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may offer a conversion health policy that, with respect to mental health services, offers reduced coverage and increased cost-sharing by the purchaser.

    (c)  __Health Care For Certain Separated Members Not Otherwise Eligible__  __.—__ 

        (1) Consistent with the authority of the Secretary concerned to designate certain classes of persons as eligible to receive health care at a military medical facility, the Secretary concerned should consider authorizing, on an individual basis in cases of hardship, the provision of that care for a member who is separated from the armed forces, and is ineligible for transitional health care under subsection (a) or does not obtain a conversion health policy (or a dependent of the member).

        (2) The Secretary concerned shall give special consideration to requests for such care in cases in which the condition for which treatment is required was incurred or aggravated by the member or the dependent before the date of the separation of the member, particularly if the condition is a result of the particular circumstances of the service of the member.

    (d)  __Definition__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “conversion health policy” means a health insurance policy with a private insurer, developed through negotiations between the Secretary of Defense and a private insurer, that is available for purchase by or for the use of a person who is no longer a member of the armed forces or a covered beneficiary.

    (e)  __Coast Guard__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this section for the members of the Coast Guard and their dependents when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy.
