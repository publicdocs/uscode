        (4) any gaps in the ability of the elements (or other office, agency activity, or command) of the Department of Defense to provide core competencies and capabilities required to effectively perform the core missions identified pursuant to paragraph (1);

        (5) any unnecessary duplication of core competencies and capabilities between defense components; and
