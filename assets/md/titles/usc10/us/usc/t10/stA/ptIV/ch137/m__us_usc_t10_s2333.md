        (2) An organizational approach to requirements definition and coordination during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations that is designed to ensure that requirements are defined in a way that effectively implements United States Government and Department of Defense objectives, policies, and decisions regarding the allocation of resources, coordination of interagency efforts in the theater of operations, and alignment of requirements with the proper use of funds.

    The joint policy for contingency program management required by subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:

        (1) The assignment of a senior commissioned officer or civilian member of the senior executive service, with appropriate program management experience and qualifications, to act as head of program management during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations, including stabilization and reconstruction operations involving multiple United States Government agencies and international organizations, if required.

        (2) A preplanned organizational approach to program management during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations that is designed to ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to conduct such program management.

        (3) Identification of a deployable cadre of experts, with the appropriate tools and authority, and trained in processes under paragraph (6).

        (4) Utilization of the hiring and appointment authorities necessary for the rapid deployment of personnel to ensure the availability of key personnel for sufficient lengths of time to provide for continuing program and project management.

        (5)

         A requirement to provide training (including training under a program to be created by the Defense Acquisition University) to program management personnel in—

            (A) the use of laws, regulations, policies, and directives related to program management in combat or contingency environments;

        (1)

         The joint policy for contingency contracting required by subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:

            (A) The designation of a senior commissioned officer or civilian member of the senior executive service in each military department with the responsibility for administering the policy.

            (C) A sourcing approach to contingency contracting that is designed to ensure that each military department is prepared to conduct contingency contracting during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations, including stabilization and reconstruction operations involving interagency organizations, if required.

            (D)

                (iii) the appropriate use of rapid acquisition authority, commanders’ emergency response program funds, and other tools unique to contingency contracting; and

                (iv) instruction on the necessity for the prompt transition from the use of rapid acquisition authority to the use of full and open competition and other methods of contracting that maximize transparency in the acquisition process.

            (E) Appropriate steps to ensure that training is maintained for such personnel even when they are not deployed in a contingency operation.

            (F) Such steps as may be needed to ensure jointness and cross-service coordination in the area of contingency contracting.
