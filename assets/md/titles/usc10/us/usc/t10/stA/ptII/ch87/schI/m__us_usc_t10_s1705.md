    (c)  __Management__  __.—__ 

    The Fund shall be managed by a senior official of the Department of Defense designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics for that purpose, from among persons with an extensive background in management relating to acquisition and personnel.

Any amount so remitted shall be credited to the Fund under subparagraph (A).
