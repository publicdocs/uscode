    (b) The Secretary concerned may defer, for not more than four months, the retirement under subsection (a) of any warrant officer if, because of unavoidable circumstances, evaluation of his physical condition and determination of his entitlement to retirement or separation for physical disability require hospitalization or medical observation that cannot be completed before the date when he would otherwise be required to retire under this section.

    (c) Under such regulations as he may prescribe, the Secretary concerned may defer the retirement under subsection (a) of any warrant officer upon the recommendation of a board of officers and with the consent of the warrant officer, but not later than 60 days after he becomes 62 years of age.
