## § 2324. Allowable costs under defense contracts

    (a)  __Indirect Cost That Violates a FAR Cost Principle__  __.—__ 

    The head of an agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or applicable agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.

    (b)  __Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to—

            (A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus

            (B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the United States for the use of any funds which a contractor has been paid in excess of the amount to which the contractor was entitled.

        (2) If the head of the agency determines that a proposal for settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a cost determined to be unallowable in the case of such contractor before the submission of such proposal, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted.

    (c)  __Waiver of Penalty__  __.—__ 

    The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs when—

        (1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;

        (2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or

        (3)

         the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer’s satisfaction, that—

            (A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and

            (B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.

    (d)  __Applicability of Contract Disputes Procedure to Disallowance of Cost and Assessment of Penalty__  __.—__ 

    An action of the head of an agency under subsection (a) or (b)—

        (1) shall be considered a final decision for the purposes of [section 7103 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s7103]; and

        (2) is appealable in the manner provided in [section 7104(a) of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s7104/a].

            (D) Payments of fines and penalties resulting from violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, State, local, or foreign laws and regulations, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or specific written instructions from the contracting officer authorizing in advance such payments in accordance with applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

            (N) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign national employed by the contractor under a service contract performed in a foreign country if the termination of the employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States military facility in that country at the request of the government of that country.

The Secretary may include such a provision in a military banking contract only if the Secretary determines, with respect to that contract, that the contractor has taken (or has established plans to take) appropriate actions within the contractor’s control to minimize the amount and number of incidents of the payment of severance pay by the contractor to employees under the contract who are foreign nationals.

            (B)

             In subparagraph (A):

            (C) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a contract with a financial institution that is owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a foreign country, as determined by the Secretary of Defense. Such a determination shall be made in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph (1) of section 4(g) of the Buy American Act (as added by section 7002(2) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988) and the policy guidance referred to in paragraph (2)(A) of that section.

        (3)

            (A)

             Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and subject to the availability of appropriations, the head of an agency awarding a covered contract (other than a contract to which paragraph (2) applies) may waive the application of the provisions of paragraphs (1)(M) and (1)(N) to that contract if the head of the agency determines that—

                (i) the application of such provisions to the contract would adversely affect the continuation of a program, project, or activity that provides significant support services for members of the armed forces stationed or deployed outside the United States;

                (ii) the contractor has taken (or has established plans to take) appropriate actions within the contractor’s control to minimize the amount and number of incidents of the payment of severance pay by the contractor to employees under the contract who are foreign nationals; and

                (iii) the payment of severance pay is necessary in order to comply with a law that is generally applicable to a significant number of businesses in the country in which the foreign national receiving the payment performed services under the contract or is necessary to comply with a collective bargaining agreement.

            (B)

             The head of an agency shall include in the solicitation for a covered contract a statement indicating—

                (i) that a waiver has been granted under subparagraph (A) for the contract; or

                (ii) whether the head of the agency will consider granting such a waiver, and, if the agency head will consider granting a waiver, the criteria to be used in granting the waiver.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Subsection (e)(1)(L) is based on [section 2399 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2399] as enacted by [Pub. L. 97–295, § 1(29)(A)][/us/pl/97/295/s1/29/A], Oct. 12, 1982, [96 Stat. 1293][/us/stat/96/1293].

    Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing [10 U.S.C. 2399][/us/usc/t10/s2399] to a new subparagraph (L) of [10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)][/us/usc/t10/s2324/e/1]. The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor’s costs of correcting defects in the contractor’s materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see [10 U.S.C. 2324(k)][/us/usc/t10/s2324/k]). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.

    Subsection (j) is based on [Pub. L. 99–145, title IX, § 933][/us/pl/99/145/s933], Nov. 8, 1985, [99 Stat. 700][/us/stat/99/700].
