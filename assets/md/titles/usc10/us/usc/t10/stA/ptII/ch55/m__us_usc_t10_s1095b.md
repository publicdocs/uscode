        (2)

         A claim under this paragraph is a claim—

            (A) that is submitted to the contractor by a provider under the TRICARE program for payment for services for health care provided to a covered beneficiary; and

            (B) that is identified by the contractor as a claim for which a third-party payer may be liable.

    (b) __Recovery From Third-Party Payers.—__ 

    The United States shall have the same right to collect charges related to claims described in subsection (a) as charges for claims under [section 1095 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1095].

    (c) __Definition of Third-Party Payer.—__ 

    In this section, the term “third-party payer” has the meaning given that term in [section 1095(h) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1095/h], except that such term excludes primary medical insurers.
