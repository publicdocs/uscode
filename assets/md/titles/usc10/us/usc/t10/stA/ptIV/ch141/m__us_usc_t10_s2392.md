## § 2392. Prohibition on use of funds to relieve economic dislocations

    (a) In order to help avoid the uneconomic use of Department of Defense funds in the procurement of goods and services, the Congress finds that it is necessary to prohibit the use of such funds for certain purposes.

    (b) No funds appropriated to or for the use of the Department of Defense may be used to pay, in connection with any contract awarded by the Department of Defense, a price differential for the purpose of relieving economic dislocations.
