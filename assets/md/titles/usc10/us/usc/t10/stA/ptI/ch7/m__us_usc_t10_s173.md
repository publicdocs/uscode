    In subsection (a), the words “consistent with other provisions of sections 171–171n, 172–172j, 181–1, 181–2, 411a, 411b, and 626–626d of this title and sections 401–405 of Title 50” are omitted as surplusage. The word “establish” is substituted for the word “appoint”, since the filling of the position involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense.

    In subsection (b), the word “Secretary” is substituted for the words “appointing authority”.

    In subsection (c), the words “as a part-time adviser” are substituted for the words “in any other part-time capacity for a department or agency” to conform to subsections (a) and (b).

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 104–106][/us/pl/104/106] substituted “Other members and part-time advisers shall (except as otherwise specifically authorized by law) serve without compensation for such service.” for “Other members and part-time advisers may serve without compensation or may be paid not more than $50 for each day of service, as the Secretary determines.”

    1966—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 89–718][/us/pl/89/718] repealed subsec. (c) which provided that sections 281, 283, and 284 of title 18 did not apply to a person because of his service on a committee or as a part-time advisor under subsec. (a) of this section unless the unlawful act related to a matter directly involving a department or agency which he was advising or to a matter in which that department or agency was directly interested.

 __Termination of Advisory Committees__ 

    Advisory committees in existence on Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period following Jan. 5, 1973, unless, in the case of a committee established by the President or an officer of the Federal Government, such committee is renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a committee established by the Congress, its duration is otherwise provided by law. See [section 14 of Pub. L. 92–463][/us/pl/92/463/s14], Oct. 6, 1972, [86 Stat. 776][/us/stat/86/776], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
