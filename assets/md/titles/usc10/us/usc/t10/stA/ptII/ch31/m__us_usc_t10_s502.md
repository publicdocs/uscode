    The words “or affirmation” are omitted as covered by the definition of the word “oath” in [section 1 of title 1][/us/usc/t1/s1]. The words “of any armed force” are inserted in the last sentence, since they are necessarily implied by their use in the source statute.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Uniform Code of Military Justice, referred to in the oath, is classified to chapter 47 (§ 801 et seq.) of this title.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–364][/us/pl/109/364] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, struck out concluding provisions which read as follows: “This oath may be taken before any commissioned officer of any armed force.”, and added subsec. (b).

    1989—[Pub. L. 101–189][/us/pl/101/189] struck out “or affirmation” after “This oath”.

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–751][/us/pl/87/751] substituted “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same” for “bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America; that I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies whomsoever” and inserted “So help me God” in the oath, and “or affirmation” in text.

 __Effective Date of 1962 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 87–751, § 3][/us/pl/87/751/s3], Oct. 5, 1962, [76 Stat. 748][/us/stat/76/748], provided that:
