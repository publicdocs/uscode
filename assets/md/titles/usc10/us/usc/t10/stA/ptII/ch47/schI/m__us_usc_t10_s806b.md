    (c)  __Appointment of Individuals to Assume Rights for Certain Victims__  __.—__ 

    In the case of a victim of an offense under this chapter who is under 18 years of age (but who is not a member of the armed forces), incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the military judge shall designate a representative of the estate of the victim, a family member, or another suitable individual to assume the victim’s rights under this section.
