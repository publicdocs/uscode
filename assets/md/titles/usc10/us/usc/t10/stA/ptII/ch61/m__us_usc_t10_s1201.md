    (a)  __Retirement__  __.—__ 

    Upon a determination by the Secretary concerned that a member described in subsection (c) is unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating because of physical disability incurred while entitled to basic pay or while absent as described in subsection (c)(3), the Secretary may retire the member, with retired pay computed under [section 1401 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1401], if the Secretary also makes the determinations with respect to the member and that disability specified in subsection (b).

    (b)  __Required Determinations of Disability__  __.—__ 

    Determinations referred to in subsection (a) are determinations by the Secretary that—

        (1) based upon accepted medical principles, the disability is of a permanent nature and stable;

            (A) the member has at least 20 years of service computed under [section 1208 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s1208]; or

            (B)

             the disability is at least 30 percent under the standard schedule of rating disabilities in use by the Department of Veterans Affairs at the time of the determination; and either—

                (i) the disability was not noted at the time of the member’s entrance on active duty (unless clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the disability existed before the member’s entrance on active duty and was not aggravated by active military service);

                (ii) the disability is the proximate result of performing active duty;

                (iii) the disability was incurred in line of duty in time of war or national emergency; or

                (iv) the disability was incurred in line of duty after September 14, 1978.

    (c)  __Eligible Members__  __.—__

        (3) Any other member of the armed forces who is on active duty but is not entitled to basic pay by reason of [section 502(b) of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s502/b] due to authorized absence (A) to participate in an educational program, or (B) for an emergency purpose, as determined by the Secretary concerned.

    The words “any other member” are substituted for the words “a member of a Reserve component”, in 37:272(a) and (b), since the words “Reserve component” are defined by section 102(k) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 805][/us/stat/63/805] ([37 U.S.C. 231(k)][/us/usc/t37/s231/k]), to include members appointed, enlisted, or inducted without component. The words “active duty (other than for training)” are substituted for the words “extended active duty” for clarity and to reflect the opinion of the Comptroller General in 31 Comp. Gen. 95, 99. The words “if the Secretary also determines that” are substituted for the words “That if condition (5) above is met by a finding that”, in 37:272(a) and (b). The words “of such member”, “upon retirement”, and “to receive”, in 37:272(a), are omitted as surplusage.
