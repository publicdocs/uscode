            (B) participate in the approval of any acquisition program initiated by the Office.

        (4) To the maximum extent practicable, the procurement unit cost of a launch vehicle procured by the Office for launch to low earth orbit should not exceed $20,000,000 (in constant dollars).

        (5) To the maximum extent practicable, the procurement unit cost of an integrated satellite procured by the Office should not exceed $40,000,000 (in constant dollars).

    (f) __Required Program Element.—__ 

        (1)

         The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, within budget program elements for space programs of the Department of Defense, that—

            (A) there is a separate, dedicated program element for operationally responsive space;

            (B) to the extent applicable, relevant program elements should be consolidated into the program element required by subparagraph (A); and

            (C) the Office executes its responsibilities through this program element.

        (2) The Office shall manage the program element required by paragraph (1)(A).

    (g) __Executive Committee.—__
