## § 2918. Fuel sources for heating systems; prohibition on converting certain heating facilities

    (a)

        (1) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall provide that the primary fuel source to be used in any new heating system constructed on lands under the jurisdiction of the military department is the most cost effective fuel for that heating system over the life cycle of the system.

        (2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the determination of the life-cycle cost effectiveness of a fuel for the purposes of paragraph (1).

    (b)

     The Secretary of a military department may not convert a heating facility at a United States military installation in Europe from a coal-fired facility to an oil-fired facility, or to any other energy source facility, unless the Secretary determines that the conversion—

        (1) is required by the government of the country in which the facility is located; or

        (2) is cost-effective over the life cycle of the facility.

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–364][/us/pl/109/364] renumbered [section 2690 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2690] as this section.

    1997—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85] substituted “unless the Secretary determines that the conversion—” for “unless the Secretary—” in introductory provisions, added pars. (1) and (2), and struck out former pars. (1) and (2) which read as follows:

    “(1) determines that the conversion (A) is required by the government of the country in which the facility is located, or (B) is cost effective over the life cycle of the facility; and

    “(2) submits to Congress notification of the proposed conversion and a period of 30 days has elapsed following the date on which Congress receives the notice.”

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–661][/us/pl/99/661] substituted “Fuel sources for heating systems; prohibition on converting certain heating facilities” for “Restriction on fuel sources for new heating systems” in section catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:

    “(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a new heating system that requires a heat input rate of fifty million British thermal units per hour or more and that uses oil or gas (or a derivative of oil or gas) as fuel may not be constructed on lands under the jurisdiction of a military department.

    “(b) The Secretary of the military department concerned may waive the provisions of subsection (a) in rare and unusual cases, but such a waiver may not become effective until after the Secretary has notified the appropriate committees of Congress in writing of the waiver.

    “(c) The Secretary of the military department concerned may not provide service for a new heating system in increments in order to avoid the prohibition contained in subsection (a).”
