In making such payments, the Secretary shall combine with the payment under this section payment of any amount due the same person under section 653(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 \[[Pub. L. 100–456][/us/pl/100/456]\] ([10 U.S.C. 1448][/us/usc/t10/s1448] note). If appropriate for administrative convenience (or otherwise determined appropriate by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs), that Secretary may combine a payment to any person for any month under this section (and, if applicable, under section 653(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989) with any other payment for that month under laws administered by the Secretary so as to provide that person with a single payment for that month.

>         “(2) The Secretary concerned shall annually transfer to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs such amounts as may be necessary for payments by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under this section and for costs of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in administering this section. Such transfers shall be made from amounts that would otherwise be used for payment of annuities by the Secretary concerned under this section. The authority to make such a transfer is in addition to any other authority of the Secretary concerned to transfer funds for a purpose other than the purpose for which the funds were originally made available. In the case of a transfer by the Secretary of a military department, the provisions of [section 2215 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2215], United States Code, do not apply.

>         “(3) The Secretary concerned shall promptly notify the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of any change in beneficiaries under this section.”
