[Section 3718 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3718] shall apply to any such contract, to the extent not inconsistent with this subsection.

    (b)

        (2) No disclosure shall be made under paragraph (1) with respect to an indebtedness while a decision regarding waiver of collection of the indebtedness is pending under [section 2774 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2774] or [section 716 of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s716], or while a decision regarding remission or cancellation of the indebtedness is pending under section 4837, 6161, or 9837 of this title, unless the Secretary concerned (as defined in [section 101(5) of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s101/5]) determines that disclosure under that paragraph pending such decision is in the best interests of the United States.
