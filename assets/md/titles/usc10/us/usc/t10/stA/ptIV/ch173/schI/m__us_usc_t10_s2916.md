## § 2916. Sale of electricity from alternate energy and cogeneration production facilities

    (a) The Secretary of a military department may sell, contract to sell, or authorize the sale by a contractor to a public or private utility company of electrical energy generated from alternate energy or cogeneration type production facilities which are under the jurisdiction (or produced on land which is under the jurisdiction) of the Secretary concerned. The sale of such energy shall be made under such regulations, for such periods, and at such prices as the Secretary concerned prescribes consistent with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ([16 U.S.C. 2601][/us/usc/t16/s2601] et seq.).

    (b)

        (1) Proceeds from sales under subsection (a) shall be credited to the appropriation account currently available to the military department concerned for the supply of electrical energy.

        (2) Subject to the availability of appropriations for this purpose, proceeds credited under paragraph (1) may be used to carry out military construction projects under the energy performance plan developed by the Secretary of Defense under [section 2911(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2911/b], including minor military construction projects authorized under [section 2805 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2805] that are designed to increase energy conservation.

    (c) Before carrying out a military construction project described in subsection (b) using proceeds from sales under subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall notify Congress in writing of the project, the justification for the project, and the estimated cost of the project. The project may be carried out only after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by Congress or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to [section 480 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s480].
