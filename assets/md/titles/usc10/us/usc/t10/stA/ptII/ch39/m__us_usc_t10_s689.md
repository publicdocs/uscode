    (c) __Members Who Previously Served in Grade Higher Than Retired Grade.—__ 

        (1) A retired member ordered to active duty under section 688 or 688a of this title who has previously served on active duty satisfactorily, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, in a grade higher than that member’s retired grade may be ordered to active duty in the highest grade in which the member had so served satisfactorily, except that such a member may not be so ordered to active duty in a grade above major general or rear admiral.

        (2) A retired member ordered to active duty in a grade that is higher than the member’s retired grade pursuant to subsection (a) shall be treated for purposes of [section 690 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s690] as if the member was promoted to that higher grade while on that tour of active duty.
