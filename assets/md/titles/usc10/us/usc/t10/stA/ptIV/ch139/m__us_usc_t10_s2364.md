## § 2364. Coordination and communication of defense research activities

    (a)  __Coordination of Department of Defense Technological Data__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Defense shall promote, monitor, and evaluate programs for the communication and exchange of technological data—

        (1) among the Defense research facilities, combatant commands, and other organizations that are involved in developing for the Department of Defense the technological requirements for new items for use by combat forces; and

        (2) among Defense research facilities and other offices, agencies, and bureaus in the Department that are engaged in related technological matters.

    (b)  __Functions of Defense Research Facilities__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Defense shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable—

        (1) that Defense research facilities are assigned broad mission requirements rather than specific hardware needs;

        (2) that appropriate personnel of such facilities are assigned to serve as consultants on component and support system standardization;

        (3) that the managers of such facilities have broad latitude to choose research and development projects;

        (4) that technology position and issue papers prepared by Defense research facilities are readily available to all components of the Department of Defense and to contractors who submit bids or proposals for Department of Defense contracts; and

        (5) that, in order to promote increased consideration of technological issues early in the development process, any technological assessment made by a Defense research facility shall be provided to the Defense Technical Information Center repository to support acquisition decisions.

    (c)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “Defense research facility” means a Department of Defense facility which performs or contracts for the performance of—

        (1) basic research; or

        (2) applied research known as exploratory development.
