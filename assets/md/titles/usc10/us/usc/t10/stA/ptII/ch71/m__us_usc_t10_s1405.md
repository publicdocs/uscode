## § 1405. Years of service

    (a) __In General.—__ 

    For the purposes of the computation of the years of service of a member of the armed forces under a provision of this title providing for such computation to be made under this section, the years of service of the member are computed by adding—

        (1) his years of active service;

        (2) the years of service, not included in clause (1), with which he was entitled to be credited on May 31, 1958, in computing his basic pay; and

        (3) the years of service, not included in clause (1) or (2), with which he would be entitled to be credited under [section 12733 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s12733] if he were entitled to retired pay under [section 12731 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s12731].

    (b) __Fractional Years of Service.—__ 

    In determining a member’s years of service under subsection (a)—

        (1) each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member shall be credited as 1⁄12 of a year; and

        (2) any remaining fractional part of a month shall be disregarded.

    (c) __Exclusion of Time Required To Be Made Up or Excluded.—__ 

        (1) Time required to be made up by an enlisted member of the Army or Air Force under [section 972(a) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s972/a], or required to be made up by an enlisted member of the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard under that section with respect to a period of time after October 5, 1994, may not be counted in determining years of service under subsection (a).

        (2) [Section 972(b) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s972/b] excludes from computation of an officer’s years of service for purposes of this section any time identified with respect to that officer under that section.

    The amendment reflects [section 11 of the Act of May 20, 1958][/us/act/1958-05-20/s11], [Pub. L. 85–422][/us/pl/85/422] ([72 Stat. 130][/us/stat/72/130]).

 __1962__  __Act__ 

    The change corrects a typographical error.

 __1982__  __Act__ 

This amends 10:1405 to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956 relating to retirement pay of warrant officers advanced on the retired list. Under provisions of law first enacted in 1948 through the codification of title 10 in 1956 and until 1965, warrant officers advanced on the retired list received credit for inactive service in the computation of retirement pay. The Comptroller General in 1965 (B–156576) held in effect that computation of such retirement pay was governed by the wording of new title 10 that based the computation on years of active service only even though this had the result of making a substantive change. The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives concurs that an error was made in the codification of title 10 and has indicated that corrective legislative action is properly a responsibility of the House Judiciary Committee. See, also, the amendments to 10:3992 and 8992 made by sections 1(40) and 1(52), respectively.
