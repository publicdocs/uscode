    In subsection (c)(5), the words “It is the sense of Congress that” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “Secretary of Defense” are substituted for “Department of Defense” the first time it appears because the responsibility is in the head of the agency. The word “Therefore” is omitted as surplus. The word “complete” is substituted for “full”, and the word “personnel” is substituted for “manpower” except in the phrase “manpower requirements”, for consistency.

    In subsection (i), the words “may be . . . only if” are substituted for “No . . . may be . . . unless” to use the positive voice. The words “after June 30, 1966” are substituted for “after that date” for clarity.
