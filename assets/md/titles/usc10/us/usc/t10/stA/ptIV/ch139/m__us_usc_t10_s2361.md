    (a)

     The Secretary of Defense may not make a grant or award a contract to a college or university for the performance of research and development, or for the construction of any research or other facility, unless—

        (1) in the case of a grant, the grant is made using competitive procedures; and

        (2) in the case of a contract, the contract is awarded in accordance with [section 2304 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2304] (other than pursuant to subsection (c)(5) of that section).

    (b)

        (1)

         A provision of law may not be construed as modifying or superseding the provisions of subsection (a), or as requiring funds to be made available by the Secretary of Defense to a particular college or university by grant or contract, unless that provision of law—

            (A) specifically refers to this section;

            (B) specifically states that such provision of law modifies or supersedes the provisions of this section; and

            (C) specifically identifies the particular college or university involved and states that the grant to be made or the contract to be awarded, as the case may be, pursuant to such provision of law is being made or awarded in contravention of subsection (a).

        (2)

         A grant may not be made, or a contract awarded, pursuant to a provision of law that authorizes or requires the making of the grant, or the awarding of the contract, in a manner that is inconsistent with subsection (a) until—

            (A) the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a notice in writing of the intent to make the grant or award the contract; and

            (B) a period of 180 days has elapsed after the date on which the notice is received by Congress.
