        (4) to assist in prioritizing such projects within the military construction budget of each of the armed forces.

    (b)  __Vulnerability Assessments__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Defense shall require vulnerability assessments of military installations to be conducted, at regular intervals, using the criteria developed under subsection (a).
