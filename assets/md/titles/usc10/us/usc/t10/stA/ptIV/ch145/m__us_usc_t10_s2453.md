## § 2453. Supply catalog: distribution and use

    The Secretary of Defense shall distribute the parts of the supply catalog described in [section 2451 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2451] as they are completed. Existing catalogs shall be replaced according to schedules established by the Secretary.
