            (A) the major weapon system is a commercial item, as defined in [section 103 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s103]; and

            (B) such treatment is necessary to meet national security objectives; and

        (2) the congressional defense committees are notified at least 30 days before such treatment or purchase occurs.

    A subsystem of a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item as defined in [section 104 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s104]) shall be treated as a commercial item and purchased under procedures established for the procurement of commercial items if either—

        (1) the subsystem is intended for a major weapon system that is being purchased, or has been purchased, under procedures established for the procurement of commercial items in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a); or

        (2) the contracting officer determines in writing that the subsystem is a commercial item, as defined in [section 103 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s103].

    (c)  __Treatment of Components and Spare Parts as Commercial Items__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         A component or spare part for a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item as defined in [section 104 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s104]) may be treated as a commercial item for the purposes of [section 2306a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2306a] if either—

            (A)

        (2) This subsection shall apply only to components and spare parts that are acquired by the Department of Defense through a prime contract or a modification to a prime contract (or through a subcontract under a prime contract or modification to a prime contract on which the prime contractor adds no, or negligible, value).

    (d)  __Information Submitted__  __.—__

            (A) prices paid for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers;

            (B)

             if the contracting officer determines that the offeror does not have access to and cannot provide sufficient information described in subparagraph (A) to determine the reasonableness of price, information on—

                (i) prices for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;

                (ii) prices for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;

                (iii) prices for alternative solutions or approaches; and

                (iv) other relevant information that can serve as the basis for a price assessment; and

            (C) if the contracting officer determines that the information submitted pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

        (2) An offeror may not be required to submit information described in paragraph (1)(C) with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item and may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.

    (e)  __Delegation__  __.—__ 

    The authority of the Secretary of Defense to make a determination under subsection (a) may be delegated only to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, without further redelegation.

    (f)  __Major Weapon System Defined__  __.—__
