    (b)  __Treatment of Subsystems as Commercial Items__  __.—__ 

    A subsystem of a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item as defined in [section 104 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s104]) shall be treated as a commercial item and purchased under procedures established for the procurement of commercial items only if—

        (1) the subsystem is intended for a major weapon system that is being purchased, or has been purchased, under procedures established for the procurement of commercial items in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a); or

        (2)

         the contracting officer determines in writing that—

            (A) the subsystem is a commercial item, as defined in [section 103 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s103]; and

            (B) the offeror has submitted sufficient information to evaluate, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price for such subsystem.

    (c)  __Treatment of Components and Spare Parts as Commercial Items__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         A component or spare part for a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item as defined in [section 104 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s104]) may be treated as a commercial item for the purposes of [section 2306a of this title][/us/usc/t10/s2306a] only if—

        (2) This subsection shall apply only to components and spare parts that are acquired by the Department of Defense through a prime contract or a modification to a prime contract (or through a subcontract under a prime contract or modification to a prime contract on which the prime contractor adds no, or negligible, value).

    (d)  __Information Submitted__  __.—__ 

    To the extent necessary to make a determination under subsection (a)(2), (b)(2), or (c)(1)(B), the contracting officer may request the offeror to submit—

        (1) prices paid for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions by both government and commercial customers; and

        (2) if the contracting officer determines that the information described in paragraph (1) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

    (e)  __Delegation__  __.—__ 

    The authority of the Secretary of Defense to make a determination under subsection (a) may be delegated only to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, without further redelegation.
