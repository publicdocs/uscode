            (C) No deduction may be made from the disability compensation paid to a member for the amount of voluntary separation pay received by the member because of an earlier discharge or release from a period of active duty if the disability which is the basis for that disability compensation was incurred or aggravated during a later period of active duty.

        (4) The Secretary concerned may waive the requirement to repay voluntary separation pay under paragraphs (1) and (2) if the Secretary determines that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or would be contrary to the best interests of the United States.

    (i)  __Retirement Defined__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “retirement” includes a transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.

    (j)  __Repayment for Members Who Return to Active Duty__  __.—__ 

        (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a member of the armed forces who, after having received all or part of voluntary separation pay under this section, returns to active duty shall have deducted from each payment of basic pay, in such schedule of monthly installments as the Secretary concerned shall specify, until the total amount deducted from such basic pay equals the total amount of voluntary separation pay received.

        (2) Members who are involuntarily recalled to active duty or full-time National Guard duty in accordance with section 12301(a), 12301(b), 12301(g), 12302, 12303, or 12304 of this title or [section 502(f)(1) of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s502/f/1] shall not be subject to this subsection.

        (4) The Secretary of Defense may waive, in whole or in part, repayment required under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or would be contrary to the best interests of the United States. The authority in this paragraph may be delegated only to the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.

    (k)  __Termination of Authority__  __.—__
