## § 2773. Designation, powers, and accountability of deputy disbursing officials

    (a)

        (1)

         Subject to paragraph (3), a disbursing official of the Department of Defense may designate a deputy disbursing official—

            (A) to make payments as the agent of the disbursing official;

            (B) to sign checks drawn on disbursing accounts of the Secretary of the Treasury; and

            (C) to carry out other duties required under law.

        (2) The penalties for misconduct that apply to a disbursing official apply to a deputy disbursing official designated under this subsection.

        (3) A disbursing official may make a designation under paragraph (1) only with the approval of the Secretary of Defense or, in the case of a disbursing official of a military department, the Secretary of that military department.

    (b)

        (1) If a disbursing official of the Department of Defense dies, becomes disabled, or is separated from office, a deputy disbursing official may continue the accounts and payments in the name of the former disbursing official until the last day of the 2d month after the month in which the death, disability, or separation occurs. The accounts and payments shall be allowed, audited, and settled as provided by law. The Secretary of the Treasury shall honor checks signed in the name of the former disbursing official in the same way as if the former disbursing official had continued in office.

        (2) The deputy disbursing official, and not the former disbursing official or the estate of the former disbursing official, is liable for the actions of the deputy disbursing official under this subsection.

    In the section, the words “disbursing official” are substituted for “disbursing officer” for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of section 1(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (eff. July 31, 1950, [64 Stat. 1280][/us/stat/64/1280]), restated as section 321 of the revised title contained in section 1 of the bill. The text of 10:2773 is omitted as being superseded by 31:103a and 103b.

    In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words “With the approval of a Secretary of a military department when the Secretary considers it necessary” are substituted for “When, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force, the exigencies of the service so require . . . with the approval of the head of their executive department” in 31:103a because of 10:101(7), to eliminate unnecessary words, and for consistency. The title of Secretary of War was changed to Secretary of the Army by [section 205(a) of the Act of July 26, 1947][/us/act/1947-07-26/s205/a] (ch. 343, [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]), and by sections 1 and 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, [70A Stat. 157][/us/stat/70A/157], 676). The Secretary of the Air Force is included because of sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) of the Act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501], 502), and [section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956][/us/act/1956-08-10/s1] (ch. 1041, [70A Stat. 488][/us/stat/70A/488]). The words “deputy disbursing official” are substituted for “deputies” for clarity. In clause (A), the words “to make payments” are substituted for “for the purpose of having them make disbursements” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (C), the words “to be performed by such disbursing officers” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “deputy disbursing official” are substituted for “agent officer” for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (b)(1), the word “disabled” is substituted for “incapacity” for consistency in the title. The word “until” is substituted for “for a period of time not to extend beyond” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “The deputy disbursing official, and not the former disbursing official or the estate of the former disbursing official” are substituted for “The former disbursing officer or his estate . . . but the deputy disbursing officer shall be responsible therefor” for clarity and because of the restatement. The word “liable” is substituted for “subject to any legal liability or penalty” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “actions” is substituted for “official acts and defaults”. The words “in the name or in the place of the former disbursing officer” are omitted as unnecessary.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 104–106, § 913(a)(2)(A)(i)][/us/pl/104/106/s913/a/2/A/i], substituted “Subject to paragraph (3), a disbursing official of the Department of Defense” for “With the approval of a Secretary of a military department when the Secretary considers it necessary, a disbursing official of the military department”.

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–258][/us/pl/97/258] substituted provisions authorizing a disbursing official of a military department to designate a deputy disbursing official with the same duties and penalties for misconduct as those of the disbursing official and allowing a deputy disbursing official to continue the accounts and payments in the name of a former disbursing official for two months after the death, disability, or separation of the former disbursing official for provisions authorizing any officer of an armed force accountable for public money to entrust it to another officer of an armed force to make disbursement as his agent, with both officers pecuniarily responsible to the United States for that money.
