## § 2243. Authority to use appropriated funds to support student meal programs in overseas dependents’ schools

    (a)  __Authority__  __.—__ 

    Subject to subsection (b), amounts appropriated to the Department of Defense for the operation of the defense dependents’ education system may be used by the Secretary of Defense to enable an overseas meal program to provide students enrolled in that system with meals at a price equal to the average price paid by students for equivalent meals under a comparable public school meal program in the United States.

    (b)  __Limitation__  __.—__ 

    The authority provided by subsection (a) may be used only if the Secretary of Defense determines that Federal payments and commodities provided under section 20 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act ([42 U.S.C. 1769b][/us/usc/t42/s1769b]) and section 20 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 ([42 U.S.C. 1789][/us/usc/t42/s1789]) to support an overseas meal program are insufficient to provide meals under that program at a price for students equal to the average price paid by students for equivalent meals under a comparable public school meal program in the United States.

    (c)  __Determining Average Price__  __.—__ 

    In determining the average price paid by students in the United States for meals under a school meal program, the Secretary of Defense shall exclude free and reduced price meals provided pursuant to income guidelines.

    (d)  __Overseas Meal Program Defined__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “overseas meal program” means a program administered by the Secretary of Defense to provide breakfasts or lunches to students attending Department of Defense dependents’ schools which are located outside the United States.
