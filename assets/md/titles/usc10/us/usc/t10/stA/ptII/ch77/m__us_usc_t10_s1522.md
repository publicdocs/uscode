    In subsection (a), the words “a member of” are substituted for the words “any person who, while in”, in 10:612 and 34:285e. The words “armed forces” are substituted for the words “the military service of the United States”, in 10:612; and “the naval service of the United States”, in 34:285e (which did not appear in the source statute for the revised section, as amended by the [act of July 17, 1953, ch. 220, § 1(b)][/us/act/1953-07-17/ch220/s1/b], [67 Stat. 177][/us/stat/67/177]). The words “other than a commissioned grade” are substituted for the words “noncommissioned grade” to make it clear that the revised section covers warrant officers.
