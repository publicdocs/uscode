## § 948b. Military commissions generally

    (a)  __Purpose__  __.—__ 

    This chapter establishes procedures governing the use of military commissions to try alien unprivileged enemy belligerents for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commission.

    (b)  __Authority for Military Commissions Under This Chapter__  __.—__ 

    The President is authorized to establish military commissions under this chapter for offenses triable by military commission as provided in this chapter.

    (c)  __Construction of Provisions__  __.—__ 

    The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its own force binding on military commissions established under this chapter.

    (d)  __Inapplicability of Certain Provisions__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         The following provisions of this title shall not apply to trial by military commission under this chapter:

            (A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any rule of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.

            (B) Sections 831(a), (b), and (d) (articles 31(a), (b), and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to compulsory self-incrimination.

            (C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.

        (2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by this chapter.

    (e)  __Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Private Right of Action__  __.—__ 

    No alien unprivileged enemy belligerent subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a basis for a private right of action.

(Added [Pub. L. 111–84, div. A, title XVIII, § 1802][/us/pl/111/84/s1802], Oct. 28, 2009, [123 Stat. 2575][/us/stat/123/2575].)

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 948b, added [Pub. L. 109–366, § 3(a)(1)][/us/pl/109/366/s3/a/1], Oct. 17, 2006, [120 Stat. 2602][/us/stat/120/2602], related to military commissions generally, prior to the general amendment of this chapter by [Pub. L. 111–84][/us/pl/111/84].

    Ex. Ord. No. 13425, Feb. 14, 2007, 72 F.R. 7737, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ([Public Law 109–366][/us/pl/109/366]), the Authorization for Use of Military Force ([Public Law 107–40][/us/pl/107/40]), and [section 948b(b) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s948b/b], United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    (b) “alien” means a person who is not a citizen of the United States.

                              George W. Bush.
