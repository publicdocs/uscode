## § 432. Use, disposition, and auditing of funds

    (a)  __Use of Funds__  __.—__

    (b)  __Audits__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary of Defense shall assign an organization within the Department of Defense to have auditing responsibility with respect to activities authorized under this subchapter.

        (2) That organization shall audit the use and disposition of funds generated by any commercial activity authorized under this subchapter not less often than annually. The results of all such audits shall be promptly reported to the congressional defense committees and the congressional intelligence committees (as defined in [section 437(c) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s437/c]).
