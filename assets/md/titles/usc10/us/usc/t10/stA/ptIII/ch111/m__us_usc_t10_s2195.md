        (1) make an offer for participation in the cooperative work-education program directly to a student and appoint such student to an entry-level position of employment in the laboratory of such director;

        (2) pay such person a rate of basic pay, not to exceed the maximum rate of pay provided for grade GS–9 under the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332], that is competitive with compensation levels provided for entry-level positions in similar industry-sponsored cooperative work-education programs;

     A director of a defense laboratory may—

        (1) require a student, as a condition for receiving payments referred to in subsection (b)(4), to enter into a written agreement to continue employment in such defense laboratory for a period of service specified in the agreement; or

        (2) make such payments without requiring such an agreement.

    (d)

        (1) The Director of the National Security Agency may provide a qualifying employee of a defense laboratory of that Agency with living quarters at no charge, or at a rate or charge prescribed by the Director by regulation, without regard to [section 5911(c) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5911/c].

        (2)
