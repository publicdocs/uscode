    (c)  __Notification of Transfer__  __.—__ 

    Before responsibility for a ballistic missile defense program is transferred from the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees notice in writing of the Secretary’s intent to make that transfer. The Secretary shall include with such notice a certification that the program has met the criteria established under subsection (b) for such a transfer. The transfer may then be carried out after the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date of such notice.

    (d)  __Conforming Budget and Planning Transfers__  __.—__ 

    When a ballistic missile defense program is transferred from the Missile Defense Agency to the Secretary of a military department in accordance with this section, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that all appropriate conforming changes are made to proposed or projected funding allocations in the future-years defense program under [section 221 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s221] and other Department of Defense program, budget, and planning documents.

    (e)  __Follow-on Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation__  __.—__
