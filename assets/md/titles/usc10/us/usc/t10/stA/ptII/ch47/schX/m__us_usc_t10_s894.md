    In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the words “or persons” are omitted, since, under [section 1 of title 1][/us/usc/t1/s1], words importing the singular may apply to several persons.

    In subsection (a)(3), the word “a” is substituted for the words “an offense of”. The words “commissioned officer” are inserted after the word “superior”, for clarity.
