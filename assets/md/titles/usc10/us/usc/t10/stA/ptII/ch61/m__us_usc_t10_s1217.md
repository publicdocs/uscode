    The revised section is inserted to reflect the limited definition of the word “member” in section 102(b) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 ([37 U.S.C. 231(b)][/us/usc/t37/s231/b]).

 __1958__  __Act__ 

    Aviation cadets were omitted from chapter 61 because Title IV of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (formerly [37 U.S.C. 271][/us/usc/t37/s271] et seq.), which was the source law for this chapter, covered only members entitled to basic pay and it was believed that aviation cadets were not so entitled. However, the Comptroller General has ruled that aviation cadets are entitled to basic pay (30 Comp. Gen. 431). Accordingly, aviation cadets were covered by Title IV and should not be excepted from chapter 61.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 109–364][/us/pl/109/364] substituted “October 28, 2004” for “the date of the enactment of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005”.

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–375][/us/pl/108/375] amended section catchline and text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “This chapter does not apply to cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, or the Coast Guard Academy, or to midshipmen of the Navy.”

    1958—[Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] struck out provisions which made chapter inapplicable to aviation cadets.

 __Effective Date of 1958 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861] effective Aug. 10, 1956, see [section 33(g) of Pub. L. 85–861][/us/pl/85/861/s33/g], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s101].
