        Chief warrant officer, W–4.

        Chief warrant officer, W–3.

        Chief warrant officer, W–2.

        Warrant officer, W–1.

    (b) Appointments in the grade of regular warrant officer, W–1, shall be made by warrant, except that with respect to an armed force under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary concerned may provide by regulation that appointments in that grade in that armed force shall be made by commission. Appointments in regular chief warrant officer grades shall be made by commission by the President, and appointments (whether by warrant or commission) in the grade of regular warrant officer, W–1, shall be made by the President, except that appointments in that grade in the Coast Guard shall be made by the Secretary concerned.

In computing the limitation prescribed in the preceding sentence, there shall be excluded warrant officers described in [section 582 of this title][/us/usc/t10/s582].
