            (B) the total amount of basic pay accrued for that month for active duty (other than the Coast Guard) and for full-time National Guard duty (other than full-time National Guard duty for training only), but excluding the amount expected to be paid for any duty that would be excluded for active-duty end strength purposes by [section 115(i) of this title][/us/usc/t10/s115/i].

        (2)

         The product of—
