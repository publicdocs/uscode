## § 1611. Postemployment assistance: certain terminated intelligence employees

    (a) __Authority.—__ 

    Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense may, in the case of any individual who is a qualified former intelligence employee, use appropriated funds—

        (1) to assist that individual in finding and qualifying for employment other than in a defense intelligence position;

        (2) to assist that individual in meeting the expenses of treatment of medical or psychological disabilities of that individual; and

        (3) to provide financial support to that individual during periods of unemployment.

    (b) __Qualified Former Intelligence Employees.—__ 

    For purposes of this section, a qualified former intelligence employee is an individual who was employed as a civilian employee of the Department of Defense in a sensitive defense intelligence position—

        (1) who has been found to be ineligible for continued access to information designated as “Sensitive Compartmented Information” and employment in a defense intelligence position; or

        (2) whose employment in a defense intelligence position has been terminated.

    (c) __Conditions.—__ 

    Assistance may be provided to a qualified former intelligence employee under subsection (a) only if the Secretary determines that such assistance is essential to—

        (1) maintain the judgment and emotional stability of the qualified former intelligence employee; and

        (2) avoid circumstances that might lead to the unlawful disclosure of classified information to which the qualified former intelligence employee had access.

    (d) __Duration of Assistance.—__ 

    Assistance may not be provided under this section in the case of any individual after the end of the five-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the employment of the individual in a defense intelligence position.
