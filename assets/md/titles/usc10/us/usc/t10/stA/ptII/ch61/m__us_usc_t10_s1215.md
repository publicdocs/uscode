## § 1215. Members other than Regulars: applicability of laws

    The laws and regulations that entitle any retired member of a regular component of the armed forces to pay, rights, benefits, or privileges extend the same pay, rights, benefits, or privileges to any other member of the armed forces who is not a member of a regular component and who is retired, or to whom retired pay is granted, because of physical disability.

    The words “is retired, or to whom retired pay is granted” are substituted for the words “heretofore or hereafter retired or granted retirement pay”. The words “any other member of the armed forces” are substituted for the words “all members of the reserve components”, since the words “reserve components” are defined by section 102(k) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 805][/us/stat/63/805] ([37 U.S.C. 231(k)][/us/usc/t37/s231/k]), to include members appointed, enlisted, or inducted without component.
