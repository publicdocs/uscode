## § 2410p. Contracts: limitations on lead system integrators

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__

         the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives that—

            (A) the entity was selected by the Department of Defense as a contractor to develop or construct the system or element concerned through the use of competitive procedures; and

            (B) the Department took appropriate steps to prevent any organizational conflict of interest in the selection process; or

>         “(2)

>          The Department of Defense organization responsible for the development or production of the major system ensures that Federal employees are responsible for—
