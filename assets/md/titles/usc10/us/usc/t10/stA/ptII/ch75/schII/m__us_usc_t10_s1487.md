## § 1487. Temporary interment

    Whenever necessary for the temporary interment of remains pending transportation under this chapter to a designated cemetery, the Secretary concerned may acquire, and provide for the maintenance of, grave sites in commercial cemeteries, or he may acquire the right to use such grave sites for burial purposes.
