    (d)  __Suspension and Reinstatement__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         The Secretary shall establish guidelines for the suspension of air carriers under contract with the Department of Defense for the charter air transportation of members of the armed forces and for the reinstatement of air carriers that have been so suspended. The guidelines—

            (A) shall require the immediate determination of whether to suspend an air carrier if an aircraft of the air carrier is involved in a fatal accident; and

            (B)

             may require the suspension of an air carrier—

                (i) if the carrier is in violation of any order, rule, regulation, or standard prescribed under chapter 447 of title 49; or

    (e)  __Authority To Leave Unsafe Aircraft__  __.—__ 

    A representative of the Military Airlift Command, the Military Traffic Management Command, or such other agency as may be designated by the Secretary of Defense (or if there is no such representative reasonably available, the senior officer on board a chartered aircraft) may order members of the armed forces to leave a chartered aircraft if the representative (or officer) determines that a condition exists on the aircraft which may endanger the safety of the members.

    (f)  __FAA Information__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall request the Secretary of Transportation to provide to the Secretary a report on each inspection performed by Federal Aviation Administration personnel, and the status of corrective actions taken, on each aircraft of an air carrier under contract with the Department of Defense for the charter air transportation of members of the armed forces.

    (g)  __Waiver__  __.—__

        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense may (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold from public disclosure safety-related information that is provided to the Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for the purposes of this section.

        (2)

         Information may be withheld under paragraph (1) from public disclosure only if the Secretary determines that—

            (A) the disclosure of the information would inhibit an air carrier from voluntarily providing, in the future, safety-related information for the purposes of this section or for other air safety purposes involving the Department of Defense or another Federal agency; and

            (B) the receipt of such information generally enhances the fulfillment of responsibilities under this section or other air safety responsibilities involving the Department of Defense or another Federal agency.

        (3) If the Secretary provides to the head of another agency safety-related information described in paragraph (1) with respect to which the Secretary has made a determination described in paragraph (2), the head of that agency shall (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold the information from public disclosure unless the disclosure is specifically authorized by the Secretary.
