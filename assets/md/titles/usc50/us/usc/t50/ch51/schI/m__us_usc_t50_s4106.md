    (g) __Claims of internees and prisoners of war un­affected__ 

        The Commission shall expedite the payments under this section without reducing payment of claims of American civilian internees and prisoners of war filed before March 31, 1953, pursuant to the provisions of sections 4104 and 4105 of this title.

No payments shall be made to any organization under this subsection if such organization has received an award under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and no payments shall be made to any organization pursuant to clause (B) of this paragraph unless such organization has received an award for war damages from the Philippine War Damage Commission under the provisions of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946, as amended. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>
