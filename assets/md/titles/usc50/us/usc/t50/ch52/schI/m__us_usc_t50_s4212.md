## § 4212. Remedies with respect to criminal convictions

    (a) __Review of convictions__ 

    The Attorney General is requested to review any case in which an individual living on August 10, 1988, was, while a United States citizen or permanent resident alien of Japanese ancestry, convicted of a violation of—

        (3) any other Executive order, Presidential proclamation, law of the United States, directive of the Armed Forces of the United States, or other action taken by or on behalf of the United States or its agents, representatives, officers, or employees, respecting the evacuation, relocation, or internment of individuals solely on the basis of Japanese ancestry;

        on account of the refusal by such individual, during the evacuation, relocation, and internment period, to accept treatment which discriminated against the individual on the basis of the individual’s Japanese ancestry.

    (b) __Recommendations for pardons__ 

        Based upon any review under subsection (a), the Attorney General is requested to recommend to the President for pardon consideration those convictions which the Attorney General considers appropriate.
