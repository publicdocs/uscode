## § 4215. Restitution

    (a) __Location and payment of eligible individuals__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (7), the Attorney General shall, subject to the availability of funds appropriated to the Fund for such purpose, pay out of the Fund to each eligible individual the sum of $20,000, unless such individual refuses, in the manner described in paragraph (5), to accept the payment.

        (2) __Location of eligible individuals__ 

            The Attorney General shall identify and locate, without requiring any application for payment and using records already in the possession of the United States Government, each eligible individual. The Attorney General should use funds and resources available to the Attorney General, including those described in subsection (c), to attempt to complete such identification and location within 12 months after August 10, 1988. Any eligible individual may notify the Attorney General that such individual is an eligible individual, and may provide documentation therefor. The Attorney General shall designate an officer or employee to whom such notification and documentation may be sent, shall maintain a list of all individuals who submit such notification and documentation, and shall, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such purpose, encourage, through a public awareness campaign, each eligible individual to submit his or her current address to such officer or employee. To the extent that resources referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph are not sufficient to complete the identification and location of all eligible individuals, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for such purpose. In any case, the identification and location of all eligible individuals shall be completed within 12 months after the appropriation of funds under the preceding sentence. Failure to be identified and located by the end of the 12-month period specified in the preceding sentence shall not preclude an eligible individual from receiving payment under this section.

        (3) __Benefit of the doubt__ 

            When, after consideration of all evidence and relevant material for determining whether an individual is an eligible individual, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of eligibility, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to such individual.

        (4) __Notice from the Attorney General__ 

        The Attorney General shall, when funds are appropriated to the Fund for payments to an eligible individual under this section, notify that eligible individual in writing of his or her eligibility for payment under this section. Such notice shall inform the eligible individual that—

            (A) acceptance of payment under this section shall be in full satisfaction of all claims against the United States arising out of acts described in [section 4218(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4218/2/B], and

            (B) each eligible individual who does not refuse, in the manner described in paragraph (5), to accept payment under this section within 18 months after receiving such written notice shall be deemed to have accepted payment for purposes of paragraph (6).

        (5) __Effect of refusal to accept payment__ 

            If an eligible individual refuses, in a written document filed with the Attorney General, to accept any payment under this section, the amount of such payment shall remain in the Fund and no payment may be made under this section to such individual at any time after such refusal.

        (6) __Payment in full settlement of claims against the United States__ 

            The acceptance of payment by an eligible individual under this section shall be in full satisfaction of all claims against the United States arising out of acts described in [section 4218(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4218/2/B]. This paragraph shall apply to any eligible individual who does not refuse, in the manner described in paragraph (5), to accept payment under this section within 18 months after receiving the notification from the Attorney General referred to in paragraph (4).

        (7) __Exclusion of certain individuals__ 

            No payment may be made under this section to any individual who, after September 1, 1987, accepts payment pursuant to an award of a final judgment or a settlement on a claim against the United States for acts described in [section 4218(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4218/2/B], or to any surviving spouse, child, or parent of such individual to whom paragraph (8) applies.

        (8) __Payments in the case of deceased persons__ 

            (A)

             In the case of an eligible individual who is deceased at the time of payment under this section, such payment shall be made only as follows:

                (i) If the eligible individual is survived by a spouse who is living at the time of payment, such payment shall be made to such surviving spouse.

                (ii) If there is no surviving spouse described in clause (i), such payment shall be made in equal shares to all children of the eligible individual who are living at the time of payment.

                (iii) If there is no surviving spouse described in clause (i) and if there are no children described in clause (ii), such payment shall be made in equal shares to the parents of the eligible individual who are living at the time of payment.

                If there is no surviving spouse, children, or parents described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the amount of such payment shall remain in the Fund, and may be used only for the purposes set forth in [section 4216(b) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4216/b].

            (B) After the death of an eligible individual, this subsection and subsections (c) and (f) shall apply to the individual or individuals specified in subparagraph (A) to whom payment under this section will be made, to the same extent as such subsections apply to the eligible individual.

    (f) __Clarification of treatment of payments under other laws__ 

    Amounts paid to an eligible individual under this section—

        (1) shall be treated for purposes of the internal revenue laws of the United States as damages for human suffering; and

        (2) shall not be included as income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits described in [section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3803/c/2/C] or available under any other law administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or for purposes of determining the amount of such benefits.
