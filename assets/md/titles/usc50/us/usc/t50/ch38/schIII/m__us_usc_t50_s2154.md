        Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4), in the case of any qualified former spouse of a disability annuitant—

            (B) the amount of the annuity of the qualified former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the benefits for which the employee would otherwise qualify under subchapter II of chapter 84 of such title.

            (B) if applicable, 50 percent of the employee’s benefits under chapter 84 of title 5 or [section 2152(a) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2152/a] (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or [section 2157 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2157]), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service after such effective date.

        (8) __Treatment of pro rata share under title 26__ 

            For purposes of title 26, payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be treated as income to the qualified former spouse and not to the employee.

    (d) __Qualified former spouse survivor benefits__ 

        (1) __Entitlement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to an election under [section 8416(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8416/a], and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order governing survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse, such former spouse is entitled to a share, determined under subparagraph (B), of all survivor benefits that would otherwise be payable under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5 to an eligible surviving spouse of the employee.

            (B) __Amount of share__ 

            The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals—

                (i) 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was married to the employee throughout the entire period of the employee’s service which is creditable under chapter 84 of title 5; or

                (ii) a pro rata share of 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was not married to the employee throughout such creditable service.

        (2) __Survivor benefits__ 

            (A) The survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse shall include the amount payable under [section 8442(b)(1)(A) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8442/b/1/A] and any supplementary annuity under section 8442(f) of such title that would be payable if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such section.

For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term “assumed CIARDS annuity” means the amount of the survivor annuity to which the widow or widower would be entitled under subchapter II of this chapter based on the service of the deceased annuitant determined under section 8442(f)(5) of such title.

        (3) __Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55__ 

            A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subsection if, before commencement of any benefit, the qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.

        (4) __Restoration__ 

        If the survivor annuity payable under this subsection to a surviving qualified former spouse is terminated because of remarriage before becoming age 55, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if—

            (A) such former spouse elects to receive this survivor annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such former spouse may be entitled under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5, or under another retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage; and

            (B) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

        (5) __Modification of court order or spousal agreement__ 

            A modification in a court order or spousal agreement to adjust a qualified former spouse’s share of the survivor benefits shall not be effective if issued after the retirement or death of the employee, former employee, or annuitant, whichever occurs first.

        (6) __Effect of termination of qualified former spouse’s entitlement__ 

            After a qualified former spouse of a retired employee remarries before becoming age 55 or dies, the reduction in the retired employee’s annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for such former spouse shall be terminated. The annuitant may elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within 2 years after the qualified former spouse’s remarriage or death, to continue the reduction in order to provide or increase the survivor annuity for such annuitant’s spouse. The annuitant making such election shall pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of [section 8418 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8418].

        (7) __Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the share of such employee’s qualified former spouse to survivor benefits shall equal the sum of—

            (A) 50 percent of the employee’s annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or [section 2157 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2157]), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service before the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service before such effective date; and

            (B)

             if applicable—

                (i) 50 percent of the employee’s annuity under chapter 84 of title 5 or [section 2152(a) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2152/a] (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or [section 2157 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2157]), plus

                (ii) the survivor benefits referred to in subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section,

                multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service after such effective date.

    (e) __Qualified former spouse Thrift Savings Plan benefit__ 

        (1) __Entitlement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order governing disposition of the balance of an account in the Thrift Savings Fund under subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, a qualified former spouse of an employee is entitled to a share (determined under subparagraph (B)) of the balance in the employee’s account in the Thrift Savings Fund on the date the divorce of the qualified former spouse and employee becomes final.

            (B) __Method of payment__ 

                The qualified former spouse’s benefit under this subsection shall be paid in a lump sum.

            (C) __Limitation__ 

                A spousal agreement or court order may not provide for payment to a qualified former spouse under this subsection of an amount that exceeds the employee’s account balance in the Thrift Savings Fund.

                If the qualified former spouse dies before payment of the benefit provided under this subsection, such payment shall be made to the estate of the qualified former spouse.

                Any payment under this subsection to an individual bars recovery by any other individual.

        (3) __Closed account__ 

            No payment under this subsection may be made by the Director if the date on which the divorce becomes final is after the date on which the total amount of the employee’s account balance has been withdrawn or transferred, or the date on which an annuity contract has been purchased, in accordance with [section 8433 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8433].

        shall be determined in accordance with that spousal agreement or court order, if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of the spousal agreement or court order that are not inconsistent with the requirements of this section.
