            (B) otherwise affects current or former participants in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System, or their survivors.

        (2) __Extension to CIARDS__ 

            Any such order shall extend such provision of law so that it applies in like manner with respect to such Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System participants, former participants, or survivors.

        (3) __Legal status__ 

            Any such order shall have the force and effect of law.

        (4) __Effective date__

    (b) __Effect of Executive order__ 

    Provisions of an Executive order issued pursuant to this section shall modify, supersede, or render inapplicable, as the case may be, to the extent inconsistent therewith—

        (1) provisions of law enacted before the effective date of the Executive order; and

        (2) any prior provision of an Executive order issued under this section.
