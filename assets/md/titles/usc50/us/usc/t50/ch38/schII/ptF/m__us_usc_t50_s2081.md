## § 2081. Computation of length of service

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Crediting service as participant__ 

            For the purposes of this subchapter, the period of service of a participant shall be computed from the date on which the participant becomes a participant under this subchapter.

        (2) __Exclusion of certain periods__ 

            In computing the period of service of a participant, all periods of separation from the Agency and so much of any leave of absence without pay as may exceed six months in the aggregate in any calendar year shall be excluded, except leaves of absence while receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5 and leaves of absence granted participants while performing active and honorable service in the Armed Forces.

        (3) __Crediting certain periods of separation__ 

            A participant or former participant who returns to Government duty after a period of separation shall have included in the participant or former participant’s period of service that part of the period of separation in which the participant or former participant was receiving benefits under chapter 81 of title 5.

    (b) __Extra credit for periods served at unhealthful posts overseas__ 

        (1) __Classification of certain posts as unhealthful__ 

            The Director may from time to time establish a list of places outside the United States that, by reason of climatic or other extreme conditions, are to be classed as unhealthful posts. Such list shall be established in consultation with the Secretary of State.

        (2) __Extra credit__ 

            Each year of duty at a post on the list established under paragraph (1), inclusive of regular leaves of absence, shall be counted as one and a half years in computing the length of service of a participant under this subchapter for the purpose of retirement. In computing such service, any fractional month shall be treated as a full month.

        (3) __Coordination with benefits under title 5__ 

            Extra credit for service at an unhealthful post may not be credited to a participant who is paid a differential under section 5925 or 5928 of title 5 for the same service.
