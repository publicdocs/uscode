## § 2082. Prior service credit

    (a) __In general__ 

    A participant may, subject to the provisions of this section, include in the participant’s period of service—

        (1) civilian service in the Government before becoming a participant that would be creditable toward retirement under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 (as determined under section 8332(b) of such title); and

        (2) honorable active service in the Armed Forces before the date of the separation upon which eligibility for an annuity is based, or honorable active service in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service after June 30, 1960, or as a commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration after June 30, 1961.

    (b) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the total service of any participant shall exclude—

            (A) any period of civilian service on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made,

            (B) any period of service for which a refund of contributions has been made, or

            (C) any period of service for which contributions were not transferred pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section;

            unless the participant makes a deposit to the fund in an amount equal to the percentages of basic pay received for such service as specified in the table contained in [section 8334(c) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/c], together with interest computed in accordance with section 8334(e) of such title. The deposit may be made in one or more installments (including by allotment from pay), as determined by the Director.

        (2) __Effect of retirement deductions not made__ 

            If a participant has not paid a deposit for civilian service performed before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions were not made, such participant’s annuity shall be reduced by 10 percent of the deposit described in paragraph (1) remaining unpaid, unless the participant elects to eliminate the service involved for the purpose of the annuity computation.

        (3) __Effect of refund of retirement contributions__ 

        A participant who received a refund of retirement contributions under this or any other retirement system for Government employees covering service for which the participant may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest computed under paragraph (1). Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made, except that a participant who—

            (A) separated from Government service before October 1, 1990, and received a refund of the participant’s retirement contributions covering a period of service ending before October 1, 1990;

            (B) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which commences after December 1, 1992; and

            (C) does not make the deposit required to receive credit for the service covered by the refund;

            shall be entitled to an annuity actuarially reduced in accordance with [section 8334(d)(2)(B) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/d/2/B].

        (4) __Entitlement under another system__ 

            Credit toward retirement under the system shall not be allowed for any period of civilian service on the basis of which the participant is receiving (or will in the future be entitled to receive) an annuity under another retirement system for Government employees, unless the right to such annuity is waived and a deposit is made under paragraph (1) covering that period of service, or a transfer is made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

    (c) __Transfer from other Government retirement systems__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If an employee who is under another retirement system for Government employees becomes a participant in the system by direct transfer, the Government’s contributions (including interest accrued thereon computed in accordance with [section 8334(e) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/e]) under such retirement system on behalf of the employee as well as such employee’s total contributions and deposits (including interest accrued thereon), except voluntary contributions, shall be transferred to the employee’s credit in the fund effective as of the date such employee becomes a participant in the system.

        (2) __Consent of employee__ 

            Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the other Government retirement fund on account of service rendered before becoming a participant in the system.

        (3) __Additional contributions; refunds__ 

            A participant whose contributions are transferred pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be required to make additional contributions for periods of service for which full contributions were made to the other Government retirement fund, nor shall any refund be made to any such participant on account of contributions made during any period to the other Government retirement fund at a higher rate than that fixed for employees by [section 8334(c) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/c] for contributions to the fund.

    (d) __Transfer to other Government retirement systems__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If a participant in the system becomes an employee under another Government retirement system by direct transfer to employment covered by such system, the Government’s contributions (including interest accrued thereon computed in accordance with [section 8334(e) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/e]) to the fund on the participant’s behalf as well as the participant’s total contributions and deposits (including interest accrued thereon), except voluntary contributions, shall be transferred to the participant’s credit in the fund of such other retirement system effective as of the date on which the participant becomes eligible to participate in such other retirement system.

        (2) __Consent of employee__ 

            Each such employee shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the fund on account of service rendered before the participant’s becoming eligible for participation in that other system.

    (e) __Prior military service credit__ 

        (1) __Application to obtain credit__ 

            If a deposit required to obtain credit for prior military service described in subsection (a)(2) of this section was not made to another Government retirement fund and transferred under subsection (c)(1) of this section, the participant may obtain credit for such military service, subject to the provisions of this subsection and subsections (f) through (h) of this section, by applying for it to the Director before retirement or separation from the Agency.

        (2) __Employment starting before, on, or after__  __October 1, 1982__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (3)—

            (A) the service of a participant who first became a Federal employee before October 1, 1982, shall include credit for each period of military service performed before the date of separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based, subject to subsection (f) of this section; and

            (B)

             the service of a participant who first becomes a Federal employee on or after October 1, 1982, shall include credit for—

                (i) each period of military service performed before January 1, 1957, and

                (ii) each period of military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based, only if a deposit (with interest, if any) is made with respect to that period, as provided in subsection (h) of this section.

        (3) __Effect of receipt of military retired pay__ 

        In the case of a participant who is entitled to retired pay based on a period of military service, the participant’s service may not include credit for such period of military service unless the retired pay is paid—

            (A)

             on account of a service-connected disability—

                (i) incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States; or

                (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (as defined in [section 1101 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1101]); or

            (B) under chapter 67  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 10.

        (4) __Survivor annuity__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the survivor annuity of a survivor of a participant—

            (A) who was awarded retired pay based on any period of military service, and

            (B) whose death occurs before separation from the Agency,

            shall be computed in accordance with [section 8332(c)(3) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8332/c/3].

    (f) __Effect of entitlement to social security benefits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except paragraph (3) of this subsection) or [section 2083 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2083], any military service (other than military service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by a participant after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining the aggregate period of service on which an annuity payable under this subchapter to such participant or to the participant’s spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is based, if such participant, spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled), at the time of such determination, to monthly old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits under [section 402 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s402], based on such participant’s wages and self-employment income. If the military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining age 62, the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the aggregate period of service on which the annuity is based shall be redetermined, effective as of the first day of the month in which the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse attains age 62, so as to exclude such service.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

        The provisions of paragraph (1) relating to credit for military service do not apply to—

            (A) any period of military service of a participant with respect to which the participant has made a deposit with interest, if any, under subsection (h) of this section; or

            (B) the military service of any participant described in subsection (e)(2)(B) of this section.

        (3) __Effect of entitlement before__  __September 8, 1982__ 

            (A) The annuity recomputation required by paragraph (1) shall not apply to any participant who was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter on or before September 8, 1982, or who is entitled to a deferred annuity based on separation from the Agency occurring on or before such date. Instead of an annuity recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant’s old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits under [section 402 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s402]. The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the participant’s monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant’s total military wages and deemed additional wages (within the meaning of [section 429 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s429]) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the denominator of which is the total of all the participant’s wages, including military wages, and all self-employment income that were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar year in which the determination month occurs.

            (B) The reduction determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) shall not be greater than the reduction that would be required under paragraph (1) if such paragraph applied to the participant. The new formula shall be applicable to any annuity payment payable after October 1, 1982, including annuity payments to participants who had previously reached age 62 and whose annuities had already been recomputed.

            (C)

             For purposes of this paragraph, the term “determination month” means—

                (i) the first month for which the participant is entitled to old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits (or would be entitled to such benefits upon application therefor); or

                (ii) October 1982, in the case of any participant entitled to such benefits for that month.

    (g) __Deposits paid by survivors__ 

        For the purpose of survivor annuities, deposits authorized by subsections (b) and (h) of this section may also be made by the survivor of a participant.

    (h) __Deposits for periods of military service__ 

        (1)

            (A) Each participant who has performed military service before the date of separation on which entitlement to an annuity under this subchapter is based may pay to the Agency an amount equal to 7 percent of the amount of basic pay paid under [section 204 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s204] to the participant for each period of military service after December 1956; except, the amount to be paid for military service performed beginning on January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2000, shall be as follows:

<table>

              <tr>

                <td>   </td>

  </tr>

              <tr>

                <td> 

   </td>

                <td> 

            7.25 percent of basic pay  </td>

                <td> 

            January 1, 1999, to December 31, 1999.  </td>

  </tr>

              <tr>

                <td> 

   </td>

                <td> 

            7.4 percent of basic pay  </td>

                <td> 

            January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2000.  </td>

  </tr>

            </table>

            (B) The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the participant may provide or, if the Director determines sufficient evidence has not been provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the Director under paragraph (4).

        (2)

         Any deposit made under paragraph (1) more than two years after the later of—

            (A) October 1, 1983, or

            (B) the date on which the participant making the deposit first becomes an employee of the Federal Government,

            shall include interest on such amount computed and compounded annually beginning on the date of expiration of the two-year period. The interest rate that is applicable in computing interest in any year under this paragraph shall be equal to the interest rate that is applicable for such year under [section 8334(e) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8334/e].

        (3) Any payment received by the Director under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.

        (4) The provisions of [section 2031(k) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s2031/k] shall apply with respect to such information as the Director determines to be necessary for the administration of this subsection in the same manner that such section applies concerning information described in that section.
