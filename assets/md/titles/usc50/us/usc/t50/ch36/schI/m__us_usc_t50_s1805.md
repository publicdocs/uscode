## § 1805. Issuance of order

    (a) __Necessary findings__ 

    Upon an application made pursuant to [section 1804 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1804], the judge shall enter an ex parte order as requested or as modified approving the electronic surveillance if he finds that—

        (1) the application has been made by a Federal officer and approved by the Attorney General;

        (2)

         on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to believe that—

            (A) the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power: Provided, That no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and

            (B) each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;

        (3) the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures under [section 1801(h) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1801/h]; and

        (4) the application which has been filed contains all statements and certifications required by [section 1804 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1804] and, if the target is a United States person, the certification or certifications are not clearly erroneous on the basis of the statement made under section 1804(a)(7)(E)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title and any other information furnished under section 1804(d)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of this title.

    (b) __Determination of probable cause__ 

        In determining whether or not probable cause exists for purposes of an order under subsection (a)(2), a judge may consider past activities of the target, as well as facts and circumstances relating to current or future activities of the target.

    (c) __Specifications and directions of orders__ 

        (1) __Specifications__ 

        An order approving an electronic surveillance under this section shall specify—

            (A) the identity, if known, or a description of the specific target of the electronic surveillance identified or described in the application pursuant to [section 1804(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1804/a/3];

        (2) __Directions__ 

        An order approving an electronic surveillance under this section shall direct—

            (A) that the minimization procedures be followed;

            (B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified communication or other common carrier, landlord, custodian, or other specified person, or in circumstances where the Court finds, based upon specific facts provided in the application, that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a specified person, such other persons, furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish the electronic surveillance in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person is providing that target of electronic surveillance;

            (C) that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence any records concerning the surveillance or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain; and

            (D) that the applicant compensate, at the prevailing rate, such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person for furnishing such aid.

        (3) __Special directions for certain orders__ 

        An order approving an electronic surveillance under this section in circumstances where the nature and location of each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance will be directed is unknown shall direct the applicant to provide notice to the court within ten days after the date on which surveillance begins to be directed at any new facility or place, unless the court finds good cause to justify a longer period of up to 60 days, of—

            (A) the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed;

        (3) At or before the end of the period of time for which electronic surveillance is approved by an order or an extension, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.

    (e) __Emergency orders__ 

        (1)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Attorney General may authorize the emergency employment of electronic surveillance if the Attorney General—

            (B) reasonably determines that the factual basis for the issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such electronic surveillance exists;

            (C) informs, either personally or through a designee, a judge having jurisdiction under [section 1803 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1803] at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance; and

            (D) makes an application in accordance with this subchapter to a judge having jurisdiction under [section 1803 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1803] as soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after the Attorney General authorizes such surveillance.

        (2) If the Attorney General authorizes the emergency employment of electronic surveillance under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.

        (3) In the absence of a judicial order approving such electronic surveillance, the surveillance shall terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the application for the order is denied, or after the expiration of 7 days from the time of authorization by the Attorney General, whichever is earliest.

        (4) A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in [section 1803 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1803].

        (5) In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the electronic surveillance is terminated and no order is issued approving the surveillance, no information obtained or evidence derived from such surveillance shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such surveillance shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.

            (A) reasonably determines that a lapse in the targeting of such non-United States person poses a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person;

            (B) promptly notifies the Attorney General of a determination under subparagraph (A); and

            (C) requests, as soon as practicable, the employment of emergency electronic surveillance under subsection (e) or the employment of an emergency physical search pursuant to [section 1824(e) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1824/e], as warranted.

        (3) Nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons acquired under this subsection shall not be disseminated during the 72 hour time period under paragraph (1) unless necessary to investigate, reduce, or eliminate the threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.

        (4) If the Attorney General declines to authorize the employment of emergency electronic surveillance under subsection (e) or the employment of an emergency physical search pursuant to [section 1824(e) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s1824/e], or a court order is not obtained under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, information obtained during the 72 hour acquisition time period under paragraph (1) shall not be retained, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.

        (5) Paragraphs (5) and (6) of subsection (e) shall apply to this subsection.
