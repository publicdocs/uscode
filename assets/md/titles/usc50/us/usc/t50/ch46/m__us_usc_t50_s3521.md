The Director shall carry out the program in accordance with the provisions of this section.

    (b) __Participation of Agency elements__ 

        (1)

            (B) specify the items or services to be provided under the program by such providers;

            (C) assign to such providers for purposes of the program such inventories, equipment, and other assets (including equipment on order) as the Director determines necessary to permit such providers to provide items or services under the program; and

            (D) authorize such providers to make known their services to the entities specified in subsection (a) through Government communication channels.

        (2) The designation of elements and the specification of items and services under paragraph (1) shall be subject to the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

        (3) The authority in paragraph (1)(D) does not include the authority to distribute gifts or promotional items.

    (c) __Central Services Working Capital Fund__ 

        (1) There is established a fund to be known as the Central Services Working Capital Fund (in this section referred to as the “Fund”). The purpose of the Fund is to provide sums for activities under the program.

        (2)

         There shall be deposited in the Fund the following:

            (A) Amounts appropriated to the Fund.

    (e) __Payment for items and services__ 

        (1) A Government agency provided items or services under the program shall pay the central service provider concerned for such items or services an amount equal to the costs incurred by the provider in providing such items or services plus any fee imposed under subsection (f).

        (2) Payment for items or services under paragraph (1) may take the form of an advanced payment by an agency from appropriations available to such agency for the procurement of such items or services.

    (f) __Fees__ 

        (1) The Director may permit a central service provider to impose and collect a fee with respect to the provision of an item or service under the program. The amount of the fee may not exceed an amount equal to four percent of the payment received by the provider for the item or service.
