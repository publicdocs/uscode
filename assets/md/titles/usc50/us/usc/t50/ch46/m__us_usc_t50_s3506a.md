> “It is the sense of Congress that—

>     “(1) the human intelligence officers of the intelligence community have performed admirably and honorably in the face of great personal dangers;

>     “(2) during an extended period of unprecedented investment and improvements in technical collection means, the human intelligence capabilities of the United States have not received the necessary and commensurate priorities;

>     “(3) human intelligence is becoming an increasingly important capability to provide information on the asymmetric threats to the national security of the United States;

>     “(4) the continued development and improvement of a robust and empowered and flexible human intelligence work force is critical to identifying, understanding, and countering the plans and intentions of the adversaries of the United States; and

>     “(5) an increased emphasis on, and resources applied to, enhancing the depth and breadth of human intelligence capabilities of the United States intelligence community must be among the top priorities of the Director of National Intelligence.”
