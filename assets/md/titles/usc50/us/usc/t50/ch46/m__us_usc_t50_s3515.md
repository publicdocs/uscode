            (A) protect an individual in the presence of such Agency personnel from a crime of violence;

            (B) provide immediate assistance to an individual who has suffered or who is threatened with bodily harm; or

            (C) prevent the escape of any individual whom such Agency personnel reasonably believe to have committed a crime of violence in the presence of such Agency personnel.
