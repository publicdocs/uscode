## § 3101. Reports on the acquisition of major systems

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1)

         The term “cost estimate”—

            (A) means an assessment and quantification of all costs and risks associated with the acquisition of a major system based upon reasonably available information at the time the Director establishes the 2010 adjusted total acquisition cost for such system pursuant to subsection (h) or restructures such system pursuant to [section 3102(c) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3102/c]; and

            (B) does not mean an “independent cost estimate”.

        (2) The term “critical cost growth threshold” means a percentage increase in the total acquisition cost for a major system of at least 25 percent over the total acquisition cost for the major system as shown in the current Baseline Estimate for the major system.

        (3)

            (A)

             The term “current Baseline Estimate” means the projected total acquisition cost of a major system that is—

                (i) approved by the Director, or a designee of the Director, at Milestone B or an equivalent acquisition decision for the development, procurement, and construction of such system;

                (ii) approved by the Director at the time such system is restructured pursuant to [section 3102(c) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3102/c]; or

                (iii) the 2010 adjusted total acquisition cost determined pursuant to subsection (h).

            (B) A current Baseline Estimate may be in the form of an independent cost estimate.

        (4) Except as otherwise specifically provided, the term “Director” means the Director of National Intelligence.

        (5) The term “independent cost estimate” has the meaning given that term in [section 3097(e) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3097/e].

        (6) The term “major contract” means each of the 6 largest prime, associate, or Government-furnished equipment contracts under a major system that is in excess of $40,000,000 and that is not a firm, fixed price contract.

        (7) The term “major system” has the meaning given that term in [section 3097(e) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3097/e].

        (8) The term “Milestone B” means a decision to enter into major system development and demonstration pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Director.

        (9)

         The term “program manager” means—

            (A) the head of the element of the intelligence community that is responsible for the budget, cost, schedule, and performance of a major system; or

            (B) in the case of a major system within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the deputy who is responsible for the budget, cost, schedule, and performance of the major system.

        (10) The term “significant cost growth threshold” means the percentage increase in the total acquisition cost for a major system of at least 15 percent over the total acquisition cost for such system as shown in the current Baseline Estimate for such system.

        (11) The term “total acquisition cost” means the amount equal to the total cost for development and procurement of, and system-specific construction for, a major system.

    (b) __Major system cost reports__ 

        (1) The program manager for a major system shall, on a quarterly basis, submit to the Director a major system cost report as described in paragraph (2).

        (2)

         A major system cost report shall include the following information (as of the last day of the quarter for which the report is made):

            (A) The total acquisition cost for the major system.

            (B) Any cost variance or schedule variance in a major contract for the major system since the contract was entered into.

            (C) Any changes from a major system schedule milestones or performances that are known, expected, or anticipated by the program manager.

            (D) Any significant changes in the total acquisition cost for development and procurement of any software component of the major system, schedule milestones for such software component of the major system, or expected performance of such software component of the major system that are known, expected, or anticipated by the program manager.

        (3) Each major system cost report required by paragraph (1) shall be submitted not more than 30 days after the end of the reporting quarter.

    (c) __Reports for breach of significant or critical cost growth thresholds__ 

        If the program manager of a major system for which a report has previously been submitted under subsection (b) determines at any time during a quarter that there is reasonable cause to believe that the total acquisition cost for the major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold or critical cost growth threshold and if a report indicating an increase of such percentage or more has not previously been submitted to the Director, then the program manager shall immediately submit to the Director a major system cost report containing the information, determined as of the date of the report, required under subsection (b).

    (d) __Notification to Congress of cost growth__ 

        (1) Whenever a major system cost report is submitted to the Director, the Director shall determine whether the current acquisition cost for the major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold or the critical cost growth threshold.

        (2) If the Director determines that the current total acquisition cost has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold or critical cost growth threshold, the Director shall submit to Congress a Major System Congressional Report pursuant to subsection (e).

    (e) __Requirement for Major System Congressional Report__ 

        (1) Whenever the Director determines under subsection (d) that the total acquisition cost of a major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold for the major system, a Major System Congressional Report shall be submitted to Congress not later than 45 days after the date on which the Director receives the major system cost report for such major system.

        (2) If the total acquisition cost of a major system (as determined by the Director under subsection (d)) increases by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold for the program or subprogram, the Director shall take actions consistent with the requirements of [section 3102 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3102].

    (f) __Major System Congressional Report elements__ 

        (1)

            (F) A statement of the reasons for any increase in total acquisition cost for the major system.

            (G)

                (i) expressed as the percentage that the number of years for which funds have been appropriated for the major system is of the number of years for which it is planned that funds will be appropriated for the major system; and

                (ii) expressed as the percentage that the amount of funds that have been appropriated for the major system is of the total amount of funds which it is planned will be appropriated for the major system.

            (H) The fiscal year in which the major system was first authorized and in which funds for such system were first appropriated by Congress.

            (I) The current change and the total change, in dollars and expressed as a percentage, in the total acquisition cost for the major system, stated both in constant base-year dollars and in current dollars.

            (J) The quantity of end items to be acquired under the major system and the current change and total change, if any, in that quantity.

            (K) The identities of the officers responsible for management and cost control of the major system.

            (L) The action taken and proposed to be taken to control future cost growth of the major system.

            (M) Any changes made in the performance or schedule milestones of the major system and the extent to which such changes have contributed to the increase in total acquisition cost for the major system.

        (2)

         A Major System Congressional Report prepared for a major system for which the increase in the total acquisition cost is due to termination or cancellation of the entire major system shall include only—

            (A) the information described in subparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (1); and

            (B) the total percentage change in total acquisition cost for such system.

    (g) __Prohibition on obligation of funds__
