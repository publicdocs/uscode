## § 3304. Limitation on construction of facilities to be used primarily by intelligence community

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no project for the construction of any facility to be used primarily by personnel of any component of the intelligence community which has an estimated Federal cost in excess of $5,000,000 may be undertaken in any fiscal year unless such project is specifically identified as a separate item in the President’s annual fiscal year budget request and is specifically authorized by the Congress.

        (2) __Notification__ 

            In the case of a project for the construction of any facility to be used primarily by personnel of any component of the intelligence community which has an estimated Federal cost greater than $1,000,000 but less than $5,000,000, or where any improvement project to such a facility has an estimated Federal cost greater than $1,000,000, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit a notification to the intelligence committees specifically identifying such project.

    (b) __Exception__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section but subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a project for the construction of a facility to be used primarily by personnel of any component of the intelligence community may be carried out if the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence jointly determine—

            (A) that the project is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment, and

            (B) that the requirement for the project is so urgent that deferral of the project for inclusion in the next Act authorizing appropriations for the intelligence community would be inconsistent with national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality, as the case may be.

        (2) __Report__ 

            (A) When a decision is made to carry out a construction project under this subsection, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence jointly shall submit a report in writing to the appropriate committees of Congress on that decision. Each such report shall include (i) the justification for the project and the current estimate of the cost of the project, (ii) the justification for carrying out the project under this subsection, and (iii) a statement of the source of the funds to be used to carry out the project. The project may then be carried out only after the end of the 7-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees.

            (B)

             Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a project referred to in paragraph (1) may begin on the date the notification is received by the appropriate committees of Congress under that paragraph if the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense jointly determine that—

                (i) an emergency exists with respect to the national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality; and

                (ii) any delay in the commencement of the project would harm any or all of those interests.

        (3) __Projects primarily for CIA__ 

            If a project referred to in paragraph (1) is primarily for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall make the determination and submit the report required by paragraphs (1) and (2).

        (4) __Limitation__ 

            A project carried out under this subsection shall be carried out within the total amount of funds appropriated for intelligence and intelligence-related activities that have not been obligated.

    (c) __Application__ 

        This section shall not apply to any project which is subject to subsection (a)(1)(A) or (c) of section 601.
