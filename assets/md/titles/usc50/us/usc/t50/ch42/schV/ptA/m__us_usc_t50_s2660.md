        (2) Not later than the date on which the President submits to Congress under [section 1105(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105/a] the budget for an even-numbered fiscal year occurring after fiscal year 2017, the directors shall jointly develop an update to the plan developed under paragraph (1).

            (A) Design and system engineering activities of full-scale engineering prototypes (using surrogate special nuclear materials), including weaponization features as required.

            (B) Design, system engineering, and experimental testing (using surrogate special nuclear materials) of above-ground experiment test hardware.

            (C) Design and system engineering of scaled or subcomponent experimental test articles (using special nuclear materials) for conducting experiments at the Nevada National Security Site.
