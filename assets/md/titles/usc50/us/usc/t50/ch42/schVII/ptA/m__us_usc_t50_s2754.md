## § 2754. Life-cycle cost estimates of certain atomic energy defense capital assets

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that an independent life-cycle cost estimate under Department of Energy Order 413.3 (relating to program management and project management for the acquisition of capital assets) of each capital asset described in subsection (b) is conducted before the asset achieves critical decision 2 in the acquisition process.

    (b) __Capital assets described__ 

    A capital asset described in this subsection is an atomic energy defense capital asset—

        (1) the total project cost of which exceeds $100,000,000; and

        (2) the purpose of which is to perform a limited-life, single-purpose mission.

    (c) __Independent defined__ 

        For purposes of subsection (a), the term “independent”, with respect to a life-cycle cost estimate of a capital asset, means that the life-cycle cost estimate is prepared by an organization independent of the project sponsor, using the same detailed technical and procurement information as the sponsor, to determine if the life-cycle cost estimate of the sponsor is accurate and reasonable.
