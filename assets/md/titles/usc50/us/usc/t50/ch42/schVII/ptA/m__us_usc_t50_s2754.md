## § 2754. Life-cycle cost estimates of certain atomic energy defense capital assets

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that an independent life-cycle cost estimate under Department of Energy Order 413.3 (relating to program management and project management for the acquisition of capital assets) of each capital asset described in subsection (b) is conducted before the asset achieves critical decision 2 in the acquisition process.

    (b) __Capital assets described__ 

    A capital asset described in this subsection is an atomic energy defense capital asset—

        (1) the total project cost of which exceeds $100,000,000; and

        (2) the purpose of which is to perform a limited-life, single-purpose mission.

    (c) __Independent defined__ 

        For purposes of subsection (a), the term “independent”, with respect to a life-cycle cost estimate of a capital asset, means that the life-cycle cost estimate is prepared by an organization independent of the project sponsor, using the same detailed technical and procurement information as the sponsor, to determine if the life-cycle cost estimate of the sponsor is accurate and reasonable.

>     “(b)  __Cost Estimates__  __.—__ 

>     Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator, shall develop cost estimates in accordance with cost estimating best practices for capital asset projects and life extension programs of the National Nuclear Security Administration and capital asset projects relating to defense environmental management.

>     “(c)  __Revisions to Departmental Project Management Order and Nuclear Weapon Life Extension Requirements__  __.—__ 

>     As soon as practicable after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Nov. 25, 2015\], but not later than two years after such date of enactment, the Secretary shall revise—

>         “(1) the capital asset project management order of the Department of Energy to require the use of best practices for preparing cost estimates and for conducting analyses of alternatives for National Nuclear Security Administration and defense environmental management capital asset projects; and

>         “(2) the nuclear weapon life extension program procedures of the Department to require the use of use of \[sic\] best practices for preparing cost estimates and conducting analyses of alternatives for National Nuclear Security Administration life extension programs.”
