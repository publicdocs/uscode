## § 2535. Replacement project for Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico

    (a) __Replacement building required__ 

        The Secretary of Energy shall construct at Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, a building to replace the functions of the existing Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory associated with Department of Energy Hazard Category 2 special nuclear material operations.

    (b) __Limitation on cost__ 

        The cost of the building constructed under subsection (a) may not exceed $3,700,000,000. If the Secretary determines the cost will exceed such amount, the Secretary shall submit a detailed justification for such increase to the congressional defense committees.

    (c) __Project basis__ 

        The construction authorized by subsection (a) shall use as its basis the facility project in the Department of Energy Readiness and Technical Base designated 04–D–125 (chemistry and metallurgy facility replacement project at Los Alamos National Laboratory).

    (d) __Assistance__ 

        (1) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall procure the services of the Commander of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command to assist the Secretary with respect to the program management, oversight, and design activities of the project authorized by subsection (a).

        (2) The Secretary shall carry out this subsection using funds made available for the Administration.

    (e) __Deadline for commencement of operations__ 

        The building constructed under subsection (a) shall commence operations by not later than December 31, 2026.

>                 “(i) meets requirements for maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile over a 30-year period;

>                 “(ii) meets requirements for implementation of a responsive infrastructure, including meeting plutonium pit production requirements; and

>                 “(iii) will achieve full operating capability for not less than two modular structures by not later than 2027;

>             “(B) in fiscal year 2015, the National Nuclear Security Administration will begin the process of designing and building modular buildings in accordance with Department of Energy Order 413.3 (relating to relating to program management and project management for the acquisition of capital assets); and
