         the Commander of the United States Strategic Command submits to the congressional defense committees a report containing the assessment of the Commander with respect to the potential risks to national security of the proposed delay in meeting—

            (A) the nuclear deterrence requirements of the United States Strategic Command; and

            (B) national requirements related to creation of a responsive nuclear infrastructure.

    (c) __Annual certification__ 

        Not later than March 1, 2015, and each year thereafter through 2027 (or, if the authority under subsection (b) is exercised, 2029), the Secretary of Energy shall certify to the congressional defense committees and the Secretary of Defense that the programs and budget of the Secretary of Energy will enable the nuclear security enterprise to meet the requirements under subsection (a).
