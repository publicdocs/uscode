            (A) the date that is 25 years after the date on which the plan is submitted; or

            (B) the estimated date for deactivation and decommissioning of the facility.

        (3) An estimate of the cost and time needed to deactivate and decommission each nonoperational defense nuclear facility.

        (4) A schedule for when the Office of Environmental Management will accept each nonoperational defense nuclear facility for deactivation and decommissioning.

        (5)

         An estimate of costs that could be avoided by—

            (B) other means, such as reusing such facilities for another purpose.

    (c) __Plan for transfer of responsibility for certain facilities__ 

    The Secretary shall, during 2016, develop and subsequently carry out a plan under which the Administrator shall transfer, by March 31, 2019, to the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management the responsibility for decontaminating and decommissioning facilities of the Administration that the Secretary determines—

        (2) meet the requirements of the Office of Environmental Management for such transfer.

    (d) __Submission to Congress__

        (1) the plan required by subsection (a);

        (2) a description of the deactivation and decommissioning actions expected to be taken during the following fiscal year pursuant to the plan;

        (4) in the case of a report submitted during 2018 or any year thereafter, a description of the deactivation and decommissioning actions taken at each nonoperational defense nuclear facility during the preceding fiscal year.

    (e) __Termination__ 

        The requirements of this section shall terminate after the submission to the appropriate congressional committees of the report required by subsection (d) to be submitted not later than March 31, 2026.

        (2)

         The term “life cycle costs”, with respect to a facility, means—

            (A) the present and future costs of all resources and associated cost elements required to develop, produce, deploy, or sustain the facility; and

            (B) the present and future costs to deactivate, decommission, and deconstruct the facility.

        (3) The term “nonoperational defense nuclear facility” means a production facility or utilization facility (as those terms are defined in [section 2014 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s2014]) under the control or jurisdiction of the Secretary of Energy and operated for national security purposes that is no longer needed for the mission of the Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Security Administration.
