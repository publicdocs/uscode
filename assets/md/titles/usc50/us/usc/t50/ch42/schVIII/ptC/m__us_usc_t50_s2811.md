        (2)

         The Secretary may not transfer real property under the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) until—

            (B) a period of 30 days has elapsed following the date on which the notification is submitted.

    (b) __Indemnification__ 

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) and subject to subsection (c), in the sale or lease of real property pursuant to the regulations prescribed under subsection (a), the Secretary may hold harmless and indemnify a person or entity described in paragraph (2) against any claim for injury to person or property that results from the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant as a result of Department of Energy activities at the defense nuclear facility on which the real property is located. Before entering into any agreement for such a sale or lease, the Secretary shall notify the person or entity that the Secretary has authority to provide indemnification to the person or entity under this subsection. The Secretary shall include in any agreement for such a sale or lease a provision stating whether indemnification is or is not provided.

            (B) Any political subdivision of a State that acquires such ownership or control.

            (C) Any other person or entity that acquires such ownership or control.

            (D) Any successor, assignee, transferee, lender, or lessee of a person or entity described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).

        (3) To the extent the persons and entities described in paragraph (2) contributed to any such release or threatened release, paragraph (1) shall not apply.

    (c) __Conditions__

            (B) furnishes to the Secretary copies of pertinent papers received by the person or entity;

            (C) furnishes evidence or proof of the claim;

            (D) provides, upon request by the Secretary, access to the records and personnel of the person or entity for purposes of defending or settling the claim; and

            (E) begins action within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the Secretary.

        (2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the date on which a claim accrues is the date on which the person asserting the claim knew (or reasonably should have known) that the injury to person or property referred to in subsection (b)(1) was caused or contributed to by the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant as a result of Department of Energy activities at the defense nuclear facility on which the real property is located.

    (d) __Authority of Secretary__

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 7274q of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s7274q], The Public Health and Welfare, prior to renumbering by [Pub. L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136].

 __Amendments__ 

    2013—Subsec. (a)(2). [Pub. L. 113–66, § 3146(i)(6)(A)][/us/pl/113/66/s3146/i/6/A], substituted “Secretary” for “Secretary of Energy” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 113–66, § 3146(i)(6)(A)][/us/pl/113/66/s3146/i/6/A], substituted “Secretary may hold” for “Secretary of Energy may hold”.

    Subsec. (c)(1)(A). [Pub. L. 113–66, § 3146(i)(6)(A)][/us/pl/113/66/s3146/i/6/A], substituted “Secretary” for “Secretary of Energy”.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 113–66, § 3146(i)(6)][/us/pl/113/66/s3146/i/6], substituted “Secretary” for “Secretary of Energy” in heading and “Secretary determines” for “Secretary of Energy determines” in par. (1).

    2003—Subsec. (b)(2)(D). [Pub. L. 108–137, § 504(a)][/us/pl/108/137/s504/a], which directed that subsec. (b)(2) of section 3158 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 ([42 U.S.C. 7274q(b)(2)][/us/usc/t42/s7274q/b/2]) be amended by adding a subpar. (D), was executed to that section as renumbered by [Pub. L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136] to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See Amendment note below and Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note below.

    [Pub. L. 108–7][/us/pl/108/7], which directed the amendment of “Title [42 U.S.C. 7274g][/us/usc/t42/s7274g]” by adding subpar. (D) to subsec. (b)(2), was probably intended to amend [section 3158 of Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85/s3158], which was formerly classified to [section 7274q of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s7274q] prior to renumbering and transfer to this section by [Pub. L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136]. However, the amendment was not executed in view of the enactment of [section 504 of Pub. L. 108–137][/us/pl/108/137/s504] which added a substantially identical subpar. (D). See Amendment note above and Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note below.

 __Effective Date of 2003 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 108–137, title V, § 504(b)][/us/pl/108/137/s504/b], Dec. 1, 2003, [117 Stat. 1868][/us/stat/117/1868], provided that:
