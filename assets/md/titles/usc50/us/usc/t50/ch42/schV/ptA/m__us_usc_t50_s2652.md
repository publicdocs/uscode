        The Secretary of Energy may not admit to any facility of a national security laboratory other than areas accessible to the general public any individual who is a citizen or agent of a nation that is named on the current sensitive countries list unless the Secretary first completes a background review with respect to that individual.

    (b) __Moratorium pending certification__ 

        (1) During the period described in paragraph (2), the Secretary may not admit to any facility of a national security laboratory other than areas accessible to the general public any individual who is a citizen or agent of a nation that is named on the current sensitive countries list.

        (2)

         The period referred to in paragraph (1) is the period beginning on November 4, 1999, and ending on the later of the following:

            (B) That the foreign visitors program at that facility complies with Presidential Decision Directives and similar requirements relating to the safeguarding and security of sensitive information and fulfills any counterintelligence requirements arising under such Directives or requirements.

            (C) That the foreign visitors program at that facility includes adequate protections against the inadvertent release of Restricted Data, information important to the national security of the United States, and any other sensitive information the disclosure of which might harm the interests of the United States.

            (D) That the foreign visitors program at that facility does not pose an undue risk to the national security interests of the United States.

    (c) __Waiver of moratorium__ 

        (1) The Secretary of Energy may waive the prohibition in subsection (b) on a case-by-case basis with respect to any specific individual or any specific delegation of individuals whose admission to a national security laboratory is determined by the Secretary to be in the interest of the national security of the United States.

        (2)

         Not later than the seventh day of the month following a month in which a waiver is made, the Secretary shall submit a report in writing providing notice of each waiver made in that month to the following:
