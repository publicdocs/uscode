        (3)

         A fellowship awarded to a scientist under the program shall be for collaborative study and training or advanced research at—

            (A) a nonproliferation research laboratory of the Russian Federation, in the case of a scientist employed at a nonproliferation research laboratory of the United States; and

            (B) a nonproliferation research laboratory of the United States, in the case of a scientist employed at a nonproliferation research laboratory of the Russian Federation.

        (4) The duration of a fellowship under the program may not exceed two years, except that the Administrator may provide for a longer duration in an individual case to the extent warranted by extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Administrator.

        (5)
