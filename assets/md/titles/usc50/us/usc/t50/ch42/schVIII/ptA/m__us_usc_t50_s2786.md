## § 2786. Enhanced procurement authority to manage supply chain risk

    (a) __Authority__ 

    Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Energy may—

        (1) carry out a covered procurement action; and

        (2) notwithstanding any other provision of law, limit, in whole or in part, the disclosure of information relating to the basis for carrying out a covered procurement action.

    (b) __Requirements__ 

    The Secretary may exercise the authority under subsection (a) only after—

        (1) obtaining a risk assessment that demonstrates that there is a significant supply chain risk to a covered system;

        (2)

         making a determination in writing, in unclassified or classified form, that—

            (A) the use of the authority under subsection (a) is necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk;

            (B) less restrictive measures are not reasonably available to reduce the supply chain risk; and

            (C) in a case in which the Secretary plans to limit disclosure of information under subsection (a)(2), the risk to national security of the disclosure of the information outweighs the risk of not disclosing the information; and

        (3)

         submitting to the appropriate congressional committees, not later than seven days after the date on which the Secretary makes the determination under paragraph (2), a notice of such determination, in classified or unclassified form, that includes—

            (A) the information required by [section 3304(e)(2)(A) of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s3304/e/2/A];

            (B) a summary of the risk assessment required under paragraph (1); and

            (C) a summary of the basis for the determination, including a discussion of less restrictive measures that were considered and why such measures were not reasonably available to reduce supply chain risk.

    (c) __Notifications__ 

    If the Secretary has exercised the authority under subsection (a), the Secretary shall—

        (1) notify appropriate parties of the covered procurement action and the basis for the action only to the extent necessary to carry out the covered procurement action;

        (2) notify other Federal agencies responsible for procurement that may be subject to the same or similar supply chain risk, in a manner and to the extent consistent with the requirements of national security; and

        (3) ensure the confidentiality of any notifications under paragraph (1) or (2).

    (d) __Limitation of review__ 

        No action taken by the Secretary under the authority under subsection (a) shall be subject to review in any Federal court.

            (A) the adequacy of resources, such as trained personnel, to effectively exercise that authority during the four-year period beginning on that effective date; and

            (B) the sufficiency of determinations under subsection (b)(2);

        (2) review the thoroughness of the process and systems utilized by the Office of the Chief Information Officer and the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence of the Department of Energy to reasonably detect supply chain threats to the national security functions of the Department; and

        (3)

         submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that includes—

            (A) the results of the reviews conducted under paragraphs (1) and (2);

            (B) any recommendations of the Comptroller General for improving the process and systems described in paragraph (2); and
