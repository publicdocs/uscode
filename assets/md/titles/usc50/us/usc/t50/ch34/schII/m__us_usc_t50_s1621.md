## § 1621. Declaration of national emergency by President; publication in Federal Register; effect on other laws; superseding legislation

    (a) With respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is authorized to declare such national emergency. Such proclamation shall immediately be transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.

    (b) Any provisions of law conferring powers and authorities to be exercised during a national emergency shall be effective and remain in effect (1) only when the President (in accordance with subsection (a) of this section), specifically declares a national emergency, and (2) only in accordance with this chapter. No law enacted after September 14, 1976, shall supersede this subchapter unless it does so in specific terms, referring to this subchapter, and declaring that the new law supersedes the provisions of this subchapter.

([Pub. L. 94–412, title II, § 201][/us/pl/94/412/s201], Sept. 14, 1976, [90 Stat. 1255][/us/stat/90/1255].)

 __Proc. No. 7463. Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks__ 

    Proc. No. 7463, Sept. 14, 2001, 66 F.R. 48199, provided:

    A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby declare that the national emergency has existed since September 11, 2001, and, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t50/s1601] et seq.), I intend to utilize the following statutes: sections 123, 123a, 527, 2201(c), 12006, and 12302 of title 10, United States Code, and sections 331, 359, and 367 of title 14, United States Code.

    This proclamation immediately shall be published in the Federal Register or disseminated through the Emergency Federal Register, and transmitted to the Congress.

    This proclamation is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-sixth.

                              George W. Bush.

 __Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Proc. No. 7463__ 

    Notice of President of the United States, dated Sept. 4, 2014, 79 F.R. 53279, provided:

    Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, [50 U.S.C. 1622(d)][/us/usc/t50/s1622/d], I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.

    Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2014. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.

    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

                              Barack Obama.
