        (2) Notwithstanding the termination of the authorities described in section 101(b) of this Act, any such authorities, which are exercised with respect to a country on the date of such termination to prohibit transactions involving any property in which such country or any national thereof has any interest, may continue to be exercised to prohibit transactions involving that property if the President determines that the continuation of such prohibition with respect to that property is necessary on account of claims involving such country or its nationals.

    (b) __Congressional termination of national emergencies by concurrent resolution__ 

        The authorities described in subsection (a)(1) of this section may not continue to be exercised under this section if the national emergency is terminated by the Congress by concurrent resolution pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act \[[50 U.S.C. 1622][/us/usc/t50/s1622]\] and if the Congress specifies in such concurrent resolution that such authorities may not continue to be exercised under this section.
