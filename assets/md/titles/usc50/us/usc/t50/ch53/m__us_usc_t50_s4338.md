    (a) __In general__ 

        Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, all rights and interests of individuals in estates, trusts, insurance policies, annuities, remainders, pensions, workmen’s compensation and veterans’ benefits vested under this chapter after December 17, 1941, which have not become payable or deliverable to or have not vested in possession in the Attorney General prior to December 31, 1961, are divested: Provided, That the provisions of this section shall not affect the right of the Attorney General to retain all such property rights and interests and to collect all income which is payable to or vested in possession in him prior to December 31, 1961.

    (b) __Exception to requirement where beneficial owner convicted of certain crimes__ 

        Nothing contained in this section shall divest or require the divestment of any portion of any such interest the beneficial owner of which is a natural person who has been convicted personally and by name by a court of competent jurisdiction of murder, ill treatment, or deportation for slave labor of prisoners of war, political opponents, hostages, or civilian population in occupied territories, or of murder or ill treatment of military or naval persons, or of plunder or wanton destruction without justified military necessity.

    (c) __Notice of divestment__ 

        At the earliest practicable time after the effective date of this Act, the Attorney General shall transmit to the lawful owner or custodian of any interest divested by this section written notice of such divestment.

([Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 106, § 40][/us/act/1917-10-06/ch106/s40], as added [Pub. L. 87–846, title II, § 205][/us/pl/87/846/s205], Oct. 22, 1962, [76 Stat. 1115][/us/stat/76/1115].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this Act”, meaning [act Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 106][/us/act/1917-10-06/ch106], [40 Stat. 411][/us/stat/40/411], known as the Trading with the enemy Act, also known as the Trading with the Enemy Act, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see [section 4301 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4301] and Tables.
