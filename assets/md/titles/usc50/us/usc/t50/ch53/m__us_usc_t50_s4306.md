L. 92–310, title II, § 235][/us/pl/92/310/s235], June 6, 1972, [86 Stat. 214][/us/stat/86/214]; [Pub. L. 94–273, § 11(5)][/us/pl/94/273/s11/5], Apr. 21, 1976, [90 Stat. 378][/us/stat/90/378]; [Pub. L. 100–418, title II, § 2501(b)][/us/pl/100/418/s2501/b], Aug. 23, 1988, [102 Stat. 1371][/us/stat/102/1371].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [act Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 106][/us/act/1917-10-06/ch106], [40 Stat. 411][/us/stat/40/411], known as the Trading with the enemy Act, also known as the Trading with the Enemy Act, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see [section 4301 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4301] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to section 6 of the former Appendix to this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.

    Provisions that limited the salary of the alien property custodian to not more than $5,000 per annum have been omitted as obsolete and superseded. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418] struck out before period at end “: Provided further, That the President shall cause a detailed report to be made to Congress on the first day of April of each year of all proceedings had under this chapter during the year preceding. Such report shall contain a list of all persons appointed or employed, with the salary or compensation paid to each, and a statement of the different kinds of property taken into custody and the disposition made thereof”.

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–273][/us/pl/94/273] substituted “April” for “January”.

    1972—[Pub. L. 92–310][/us/pl/92/310] struck out provisions which required the Alien Property Custodian to give a bond.

    WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 9989 of August 20, 1948 \[13 F.R. 4891\], jurisdiction over the property and interests which remained blocked or restricted under Executive Order No. 8389 on September 30, 1948, was transferred, effective October 1, 1948, to the Attorney General to aid him in carrying out his functions as successor to the Alien Property Custodian, including, among others, the function of vesting property pursuant to the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended \[[50 U.S.C. 4301][/us/usc/t50/s4301] et seq.\]; and

    WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 10644 of November 7, 1955 \[former [22 U.S.C. 1631a][/us/usc/t22/s1631a] note\], the Attorney General was designated to carry out the functions of the President under Title II of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 (as added by the Act of August 9, 1955, Public Law 285, 84th Congress, [69 Stat. 562][/us/stat/69/562]) \[[22 U.S.C. 1631][/us/usc/t22/s1631] et seq.\], including certain vesting and blocking functions required by section 202 of that Act ([22 U.S.C. 1631a][/us/usc/t22/s1631a]), and the Attorney General, as designee of the President, exercises controls under Executive Order No. 8389 with respect to the net proceeds of certain property that are carried, pursuant to section 202, in blocked accounts with the Treasury; and

    WHEREAS in the interest of efficiency it is desirable to return to the Secretary of the Treasury jurisdiction over the property and interests remaining subject to such blocking controls:

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended \[[50 U.S.C. 4301][/us/usc/t50/s4301] et seq.\], Title II of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 \[[22 U.S.C. 1631][/us/usc/t22/s1631] et seq.\] and [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301] of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Sec. 4. No person affected by any order, regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other action issued or taken by either the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury in the administration of Executive Order No. 8389 may challenge the validity thereof or otherwise excuse any action, or failure to act, on the ground that it was within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury rather than the Attorney General or vice versa.

    Sec. 5. \[Amended section 1 of Ex. Ord. No. 10644, former [22 U.S.C. 1631a][/us/usc/t22/s1631a] note\]
