    2010—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 111–195][/us/pl/111/195] substituted “if a natural person, be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.” for “if a natural person, be fined not more than $100,000, or imprisoned for not more than ten years or both; and the officer, director, or agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned for not more than ten years or both.”

    Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 104–114][/us/pl/104/114], § 102(d)(3)(B), substituted “participates” for “participants”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 104–114][/us/pl/104/114], § 102(d)(1), amended subsec. (b), as added by [Pub. L. 102–484][/us/pl/102/484], generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:

    “(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may impose a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 on any person who violates any license, order, rule, or regulation issued under this chapter.

    “(2) Any property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or any vessel, together with its tackle, apparel, furniture, and equipment, that is the subject of a violation under paragraph (1) shall, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, be forfeited to the United States Government.

    “(3) The penalties provided under this subsection may not be imposed for—

    “(5) Judicial review of any penalty imposed under this subsection may be had to the extent provided in [section 702 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s702].”

    [Pub. L. 104–114][/us/pl/104/114], § 102(d)(2), struck out subsec. (b), as added by [Pub. L. 102–393][/us/pl/102/393], which read as follows:

    “(2) The penalties provided under this subsection may not be imposed for—

    “(A) news gathering, research, or the export or import of, or transmission of, information or informational materials; or

    “(B) clearly defined educational or religious activities, or activities of recognized human rights organizations, that are reasonably limited in frequency, duration, and number of participants.”

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–484][/us/pl/102/484], which directed substitution of “(a) Whoever” for “That whoever” and addition of subsec.
