## § 167o. Low-Btu gas separation and helium conservation

    (a) __Authorization__ 

    The Secretary of Energy shall support programs of research, development, commercial application, and conservation (including the programs described in subsection (b))—

        (1) to expand the domestic production of low-Btu gas and helium resources;

        (2) to separate and capture helium from natural gas streams; and

        (3) to reduce the venting of helium and helium-bearing low-Btu gas during natural gas exploration and production.

    (b) __Programs__ 

        (1) __Membrane technology research__ 

            The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall support a civilian research program to develop advanced membrane technology that is used in the separation of low-Btu gases, including technologies that remove helium and other constituent gases that lower the Btu content of natural gas.

        (2) __Helium separation technology__ 

        The Secretary of Energy shall support a research program to develop technologies for separating, gathering, and processing helium in low concentrations that occur naturally in geological reservoirs or formations, including—

            (A) low-Btu gas production streams; and

            (B) technologies that minimize the atmospheric venting of helium gas during natural gas production.

        (3) __Industrial helium program__ 

        The Secretary of Energy, working through the Advanced Manufacturing Office of the Department of Energy, shall carry out a research program—

            (A) to develop low-cost technologies and technology systems for recycling, reprocessing, and reusing helium for all medical, scientific, industrial, commercial, aerospace, and other uses of helium in the United States, including Federal uses; and

            (B) to develop industrial gathering technologies to capture helium from other chemical processing, including ammonia processing.

    (c) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 17 of [act Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 426][/us/act/1925-03-03/ch426], was redesignated section 20 and is set out as a Separability note under [section 167 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s167].
