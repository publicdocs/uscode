## § 167q. Federal agency helium acquisition strategy

    In anticipation of the implementation of Phase D described in [section 167d(d) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s167d/d], and not later than 2 years after October 2, 2013, the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and other agencies as appropriate) shall submit to Congress a report that provides for Federal users—

    (1) an assessment of the consumption of, and projected demand for, crude and refined helium;

    (2) a description of a 20-year Federal strategy for securing access to helium;

    (3) a determination of a date prior to September 30, 2021, for the implementation of Phase D as described in [section 167d(d) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s167d/d] that minimizes any potential supply disruptions for Federal users;

    (4) an assessment of the effects of increases in the price of refined helium and methods and policies for mitigating any determined effects; and

    (5) a description of a process for prioritization of uses that accounts for diminished availability of helium supplies that may occur over time.
