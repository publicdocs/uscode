## § 2361. Sense of Congress concerning contracting policy

    It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of State, to the extent authorized by law, should—

    (1)

     contract directly with suppliers in independent states of the former Soviet Union when such action would—

        (A) result in significant savings of the programs referred to in subchapter III; and

        (B) substantially expedite completion of the programs referred to in subchapter III; and

    (2) seek means to use innovative contracting approaches to avoid delay and increase the effectiveness of such programs and of the exercise of such authorities.
