## § 2365. Sense of Congress concerning purchase, packaging, and transportation of fissile materials at risk of theft

    It is the sense of Congress that—

    (1)

     the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of State should purchase, package, and transport to secure locations weapons-grade nuclear materials from a stockpile of such materials if such officials determine that—

        (A) there is a significant risk of theft of such materials; and

        (B) there is no reasonable and economically feasible alternative for securing such materials; and

    (2) if it is necessary to do so in order to secure the materials, the materials should be imported into the United States, subject to the laws and regulations that are applicable to the importation of such materials into the United States.
