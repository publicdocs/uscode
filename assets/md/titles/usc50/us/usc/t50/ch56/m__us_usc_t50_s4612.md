        (1) __Sanctions__ 

            (A)

             If the President determines that a United States person knowingly—

                (ii) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or

                then the President shall impose the applicable sanctions described in subparagraph (B).

            (B)

             The sanctions which apply to a United States person under subparagraph (A) are the following:

                (i) If the item on the MTCR Annex involved in the export, transfer, or trade is missile equipment or technology within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny to such United States person, for a period of 2 years, licenses for the transfer of missile equipment or technology controlled under this chapter.

                (ii) If the item on the MTCR Annex involved in the export, transfer, or trade is missile equipment or technology within category I of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny to such United States person, for a period of not less than 2 years, all licenses for items the export of which is controlled under this chapter.

        (2) __Discretionary sanctions__ 

            In the case of any determination referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary may pursue any other appropriate penalties under [section 4610 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4610].

        (3) __Waiver__ 

        The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) on a person with respect to a product or service if the President certifies to the Congress that—

            (A) the product or service is essential to the national security of the United States; and

            (B) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or service, the product or service is not available from any alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved manufacturing processes or technological developments.

    (b) __Transfers of missile equipment or technology by foreign persons__ 

        (1) __Sanctions__ 

            (A)

             Subject to paragraphs (3) through (7), if the President determines that a foreign person, after November 5, 1990, knowingly—

                (i) exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the trade of any MTCR equipment or technology that contributes to the design, development, or production of missiles in a country that is not an MTCR adherent and would be, if it were United States-origin equipment or technology, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States under this chapter,

                (ii) conspires to or attempts to engage in such export, transfer, or trade, or

                (iii) facilitates such export, transfer, or trade by any other person,

                or if the President has made a determination with respect to a foreign person under section 73(a) of the Arms Export Control Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2797b(a)][/us/usc/t22/s2797b/a]\], then the President shall impose on that foreign person the applicable sanctions under subparagraph (B).

            (B)

             The sanctions which apply to a foreign person under subparagraph (A) are the following:

                (i) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is within category II of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny, for a period of 2 years, licenses for the transfer to such foreign person of missile equipment or technology the export of which is controlled under this chapter.

                (ii) If the item involved in the export, transfer, or trade is within category I of the MTCR Annex, then the President shall deny, for a period of not less than 2 years, licenses for the transfer to such foreign person of items the export of which is controlled under this chapter.

                (iii) If, in addition to actions taken under clauses (i) and (ii), the President determines that the export, transfer, or trade has substantially contributed to the design, development, or production of missiles in a country that is not an MTCR adherent, then the President shall prohibit, for a period of not less than 2 years, the importation into the United States of products produced by that foreign person.

        (2) __Inapplicability with respect to MTCR adherents__ 

        Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to—

            (A) any export, transfer, or trading activity that is authorized by the laws of an MTCR adherent, if such authorization is not obtained by misrepresentation or fraud; or

            (B) any export, transfer, or trade of an item to an end user in a country that is an MTCR adherent.

        (3) __Effect of enforcement actions by MTCR adherents__ 

            Sanctions set forth in paragraph (1) may not be imposed under this subsection on a person with respect to acts described in such paragraph or, if such sanctions are in effect against a person on account of such acts, such sanctions shall be terminated, if an MTCR adherent is taking judicial or other enforcement action against that person with respect to such acts, or that person has been found by the government of an MTCR adherent to be innocent of wrongdoing with respect to such acts.

        (4) __Advisory opinions__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, may, upon the request of any person, issue an advisory opinion to that person as to whether a proposed activity by that person would subject that person to sanctions under this subsection. Any person who relies in good faith on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity would not subject a person to such sanctions, and any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such sanctions on account of such activity.

        (5) __Waiver and report to Congress__ 

            (A) In any case other than one in which an advisory opinion has been issued under paragraph (4) stating that a proposed activity would not subject a person to sanctions under this subsection, the President may waive the application of paragraph (1) to a foreign person if the President determines that such waiver is essential to the national security of the United States.

            (B) In the event that the President decides to apply the waiver described in subparagraph (A), the President shall so notify the Congress not less than 20 working days before issuing the waiver. Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led the President to apply the waiver.

        (6) __Additional waiver__ 

        The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) on a person with respect to a product or service if the President certifies to the Congress that—

            (A) the product or service is essential to the national security of the United States; and

            (B) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or service, the product or service is not available from any alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved manufacturing processes or technological developments.

             in the case of procurement of defense articles or defense services—

                (i) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy requirements essential to the national security of the United States;

                (ii) if the President determines that the person to which the sanctions would be applied is a sole source supplier of the defense articles and services, that the defense articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States, and that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available; or

                (iii) if the President determines that such articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States under defense coproduction agreements or NATO Programs of Cooperation;

            (B) to products or services provided under contracts entered into before the date on which the President publishes his intention to impose the sanctions; or

            (C)
