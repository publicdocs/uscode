In addition, the payment of any penalty imposed under subsection (c) may be deferred or suspended in whole or in part for a period of time no longer than any probation period (which may exceed one year) that may be imposed upon such person.

Except as provided in this subsection and in subsection (d), no such liability shall be asserted, claimed, or recovered upon by the United States in any way unless it has previously been reduced to judgment.

    (g) __Forfeiture of property interest and proceeds__ 

        (1)

         Any person who is convicted under subsection (a) or (b) of a violation of an export control imposed under [section 4604 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4604] (or any regulation, order, or license issued with respect to such control) shall, in addition to any other penalty, forfeit to the United States—
