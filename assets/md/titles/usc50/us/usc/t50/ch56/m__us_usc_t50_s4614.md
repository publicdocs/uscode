In addition, such officers or employees may administer oaths or affirmations, and may by subpena require any person to appear and testify or to appear and produce books, records, and other writings, or both, and in the case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any such person, a district court of the United States, after notice to any such person and hearing, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony or to appear and produce books, records, and other writings, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. In addition to the authority conferred by this paragraph, the Secretary (and officers or employees of the Department of Commerce designated by the Secretary) may conduct, outside the United States, pre-license investigations and post-shipment verifications of items licensed for export, and investigations in the enforcement of [section 4607 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4607].

        (2)

            (A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the United States Customs Service is authorized, in the enforcement of this chapter, to search, detain (after search), and seize goods or technology at those ports of entry or exit from the United States where officers of the Customs Service are authorized by law to conduct such searches, detentions, and seizures, and at those places outside the United States where the Customs Service, pursuant to agreements or other arrangements with other countries, is authorized to perform enforcement activities.

            (B)

             An officer of the United States Customs Service may do the following in carrying out enforcement authority under this chapter:

                (i) Stop, search, and examine a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or person on which or whom such officer has reasonable cause to suspect there are any goods or technology that has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the United States in violation of this chapter.

                (iii) Detain (after search) or seize and secure for trial any goods or technology on or about such vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or person, or in such package or container, if such officer has probable cause to believe the goods or technology has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the United States in violation of this chapter.

                (iv) Make arrests without warrant for any violation of this chapter committed in his or her presence or view or if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a violation.

At the end of that 20-day period, the Customs Service shall either release the goods or technology, or seize the goods or technology as authorized by other provisions of law.

            (B)

             The Secretary may designate any employee of the Office of Export Enforcement of the Department of Commerce to do the following in carrying out enforcement authority under this chapter:

                (ii) Make arrests without warrant for any violation of this chapter committed in his or her presence or view, or if the officer or employee has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a violation.

                (iii) Carry firearms in carrying out any activity described in clause (i) or (ii).

        (4) The authorities first conferred by the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 under paragraph (3) shall be exercised pursuant to guidelines approved by the Attorney General.

    (b) __Immunity__ 

        No person shall be excused from complying with any requirements under this section because of his privilege against self-incrimination, but the immunity provisions of [section 6002 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s6002] shall apply with respect to any individual who specifically claims such privilege.

    (c) __Confidentiality__ 

        (1) Except as otherwise provided by the third sentence of [section 4607(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4607/b/2] and by [section 4610(c)(2)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t50/s4610/c/2/C], information obtained under this chapter on or before June 30, 1980, which is deemed confidential, including Shippers’ Export Declarations, or with reference to which a request for confidential treatment is made by the person furnishing such information, shall be exempt from disclosure under [section 552 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552] and such information shall not be published or disclosed unless the Secretary determines that the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest.

        (2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing the withholding of information from the Congress or from the Government Accountability Office. All information obtained at any time under this chapter or previous Acts regarding the control of exports, including any report or license application required under this chapter, shall be made available to any committee or subcommittee of Congress of appropriate jurisdiction upon request of the chairman or ranking minority member of such committee or subcommittee. No such committee or subcommittee, or member thereof, shall disclose any information obtained under this chapter or previous Acts regarding the control of exports which is submitted on a confidential basis unless the full committee determines that the withholding of that information is contrary to the national interest. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, information referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph shall, consistent with the protection of intelligence, counterintelligence, and law enforcement sources, methods, and activities, as determined by the agency that originally obtained the information, and consistent with the provisions of [section 716 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s716], be made available only by that agency, upon request, to the Comptroller General of the United States or to any officer or employee of the Government Accountability Office who is authorized by the Comptroller General to have access to such information. No officer or employee of the Government Accountability Office shall disclose, except to the Congress in accordance with this paragraph, any such information which is submitted on a confidential basis and from which any individual can be identified.

        (3) Any department or agency which obtains information which is relevant to the enforcement of this chapter, including information pertaining to any investigation, shall furnish such information to each department or agency with enforcement responsibilities under this chapter to the extent consistent with the protection of intelligence, counterintelligence, and law enforcement sources, methods, and activities. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to information subject to the restrictions set forth in [section 9 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s9]; and return information, as defined in subsection (b) of [section 6103 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s6103], may be disclosed only as authorized by such section. The Secretary and the Commissioner of Customs, upon request, shall exchange any licensing and enforcement information with each other which is necessary to facilitate enforcement efforts and effective license decisions. The Secretary, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Customs shall consult on a continuing basis with one another and with the heads of other departments and agencies which obtain information subject to this paragraph, in order to facilitate the exchange of such information.

    (d) __Reporting requirements__ 

        In the administration of this chapter, reporting requirements shall be so designed as to reduce the cost of reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation required under this chapter to the extent feasible consistent with effective enforcement and compilation of useful trade statistics. Reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation requirements shall be periodically reviewed and revised in the light of developments in the field of information technology.

    (e) __Simplification of regulations__
