## § 3952. Protection under installment contracts for purchase or lease

    (a) __Protection upon breach of contract__ 

        (1) __Protection after entering military service__ 

        After a servicemember enters military service, a contract by the servicemember for—

            (A) the purchase of real or personal property (including a motor vehicle); or

            (B) the lease or bailment of such property,

            may not be rescinded or terminated for a breach of terms of the contract occurring before or during that person’s military service, nor may the property be repossessed for such breach without a court order.

        (2) __Applicability__ 

            This section applies only to a contract for which a deposit or installment has been paid by the servicemember before the servicemember enters military service.

    (b) __Misdemeanor__ 

        A person who knowingly resumes possession of property in violation of subsection (a), or in violation of [section 3918 of this title][/us/usc/t50/s3918], or who knowingly attempts to do so, shall be fined as provided in title 18 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

    (c) __Authority of court__ 

    In a hearing based on this section, the court—

        (1) may order repayment to the servicemember of all or part of the prior installments or deposits as a condition of terminating the contract and resuming possession of the property;

        (2) may, on its own motion, and shall on application by a servicemember when the servicemember’s ability to comply with the contract is materially affected by military service, stay the proceedings for a period of time as, in the opinion of the court, justice and equity require; or

        (3) may make other disposition as is equitable to preserve the interests of all parties.
