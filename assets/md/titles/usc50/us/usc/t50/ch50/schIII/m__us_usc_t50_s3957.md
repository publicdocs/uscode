## § 3957. Protection of life insurance policy

    (a) __Assignment of policy protected__ 

        If a life insurance policy on the life of a servicemember is assigned before military service to secure the payment of an obligation, the assignee of the policy (except the insurer in connection with a policy loan) may not exercise, during a period of military service of the servicemember or within one year thereafter, any right or option obtained under the assignment without a court order.

    (b) __Exception__ 

    The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply—

        (1) if the assignee has the written consent of the insured made during the period described in subsection (a);

        (2) when the premiums on the policy are due and unpaid; or

        (3) upon the death of the insured.

    (c) __Order refused because of material affect__ 

        A court which receives an application for an order required under subsection (a) may refuse to grant such order if the court determines the ability of the servicemember to comply with the terms of the obligation is materially affected by military service.

    (d) __Treatment of guaranteed premiums__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, premiums guaranteed under the provisions of subchapter IV of this chapter shall not be considered due and unpaid.

    (e) __Misdemeanor__ 

        A person who knowingly takes an action contrary to this section, or attempts to do so, shall be fined as provided in title 18, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
