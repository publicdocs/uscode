        (2) from a tax or assessment falling due before or during the servicemember’s military service.

    (b) __Tax liability or assessment__

                (ii) subject to payment of the balance of the principal and accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination or release from the applicant’s military service or from the date of application in equal installments during the combined period at the rate of interest on the unpaid balance prescribed in the contract or other instrument evidencing the obligation, and subject to other terms as may be equitable.
