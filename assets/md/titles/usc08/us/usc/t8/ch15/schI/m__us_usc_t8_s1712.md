## § 1712. Authorization of appropriations for improvements in technology and infrastructure

    (a) __Funding of technology__ 

        (1) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        In addition to funds otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated $150,000,000 to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for purposes of—

            (A) making improvements in technology (including infrastructure support, computer security, and information technology development) for improving border security;

            (B) expanding, utilizing, and improving technology to improve border security; and

            (C) facilitating the flow of commerce and persons at ports of entry, including improving and expanding programs for preenrollment and preclearance.

        (2) __Waiver of fees__ 

            Federal agencies involved in border security may waive all or part of enrollment fees for technology-based programs to encourage participation by United States citizens and aliens in such programs. Any agency that waives any part of any such fee may establish its fees for other services at a level that will ensure the recovery from other users of the amounts waived.

        (3) __Offset of increases in fees__ 

            The Attorney General may, to the extent reasonable, increase land border fees for the issuance of arrival-departure documents to offset technology costs.

    (b) __Improvement and expansion of INS, State Department, and customs facilities__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of State such sums as may be necessary to improve and expand facilities for use by the personnel of those agencies.
