        (3) Not later than 90 days after August 5, 1997, the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations which set forth the procedures by which a State or local government can verify whether an alien applying for a State or local public benefit is a qualified alien, a nonimmigrant under the Immigration and Nationality Act \[[8 U.S.C. 1101][/us/usc/t8/s1101] et seq.\], or an alien paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \[[8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)][/us/usc/t8/s1182/d/5]\] for less than 1 year, for purposes of determining whether the alien is ineligible for benefits under [section 1621 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1621].
