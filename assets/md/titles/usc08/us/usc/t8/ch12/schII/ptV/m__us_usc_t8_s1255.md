        The status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States or the status of any other alien having an approved petition for classification as a VAWA self-petitioner may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.

    (b) __Record of lawful admission for permanent residence; reduction of preference visas__ 

        Upon the approval of an application for adjustment made under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall record the alien’s lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date the order of the Attorney General approving the application for the adjustment of status is made, and the Secretary of State shall reduce by one the number of the preference visas authorized to be issued under sections 1152 and 1153 of this title within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current.

    (c) __Alien crewmen, aliens continuing or accepting unauthorized employment, and aliens admitted in transit without visa__

        (3) Paragraph (1) and [section 1154(g) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1154/g] shall not apply with respect to a marriage if the alien establishes by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place and the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien’s admission as an immigrant and no fee or other consideration was given (other than a fee or other consideration to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a lawful petition) for the filing of a petition under [section 1154(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1154/a] or subsection (d) or (p)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of [section 1184 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1184] with respect to the alien spouse or alien son or daughter.

    (g) __Special immigrants__ 

        In applying this section to a special immigrant described in [section 1101(a)(27)(K) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/27/K], such an immigrant shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, to have been paroled into the United States.

    (h) __Application with respect to special immigrants__ 

    In applying this section to a special immigrant described in [section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/27/J]—

        (1) such an immigrant shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, to have been paroled into the United States; and

         in determining the alien’s admissibility as an immigrant—

            (A) paragraphs (4), (5)(A), (6)(A), (6)(C), (6)(D), (7)(A), and (9)(B) of [section 1182(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a] shall not apply; and

            (B) the Attorney General may waive other paragraphs of [section 1182(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a] (other than paragraphs (2)(A), (2)(B), (2)(C) (except for so much of such paragraph as related to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana), (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E)) in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.

        The relationship between an alien and the alien’s natural parents or prior adoptive parents shall not be considered a factor in making a waiver under paragraph (2)(B). Nothing in this subsection or [section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/27/J] shall be construed as authorizing an alien to apply for admission or be admitted to the United States in order to obtain special immigrant status described in such section.

    (i) __Adjustment in status of certain aliens physically present in United States__ 

        (1)

         Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically present in the United States—

            (A)

             who—

                (i) entered the United States without inspection; or

                (ii) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection (c) of this section;

                (i) a petition for classification under [section 1154 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1154] that was filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001; or

                (ii) an application for a labor certification under [section 1182(a)(5)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/5/A] that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor on or before such date; and

            (C) who, in the case of a beneficiary of a petition for classification, or an application for labor certification, described in subparagraph (B) that was filed after January 14, 1998, is physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000;

            may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Attorney General may accept such application only if the alien remits with such application a sum equalling $1,000 as of the date of receipt of the application, but such sum shall not be required from a child under the age of seventeen, or an alien who is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 1160 or 1255a of this title or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 at any date, who—

            (i) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 1160 or 1255a of this title or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986;

            (A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and

            (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.

        (3)

            (A) The portion of each application fee (not to exceed $200) that the Attorney General determines is required to process an application under this section and is remitted to the Attorney General pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be disposed of by the Attorney General as provided in subsections (m), (n), and (o) of [section 1356 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1356].

            (B) Any remaining portion of such fees remitted under such paragraphs shall be deposited by the Attorney General into the Breached Bond/Detention Fund established under [section 1356(r) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1356/r], except that in the case of fees attributable to applications for a beneficiary with respect to whom a petition for classification, or an application for labor certification, described in paragraph (1)(B) was filed after January 14, 1998, one-half of such remaining portion shall be deposited by the Attorney General into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account established under [section 1356(m) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1356/m].

            (B) the provision of such information has substantially contributed to the success of an authorized criminal investigation or the prosecution of an individual described in subclause (III) of that section,

            the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien (and the spouse, married and unmarried sons and daughters, and parents of the alien if admitted under that section) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien is not described in [section 1182(a)(3)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/3/E].

        (2)

         If, in the sole discretion of the Attorney General—

            (A) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least 3 years since the date of admission as a nonimmigrant under clause (i) or (ii) of [section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/15/U]; and

            (B) in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the alien’s continued presence in the United States is justified on humanitarian grounds, to ensure family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest.

        (2) An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States under paragraph (1)(A) if the alien has departed from the United States for any period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 days unless the absence is in order to assist in the investigation or prosecution or unless an official involved in the investigation or prosecution certifies that the absence was otherwise justified.
