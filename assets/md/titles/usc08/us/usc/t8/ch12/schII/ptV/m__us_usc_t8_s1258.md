        (3) an alien (other than an alien described in paragraph (2)) classified as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (J) of [section 1101(a)(15) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/15] who is subject to the two-year foreign residence requirement of [section 1182(e) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/e] and has not received a waiver thereof, unless such alien applies to have the alien’s classification changed from classification under subparagraph (J) of [section 1101(a)(15) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/15] to a classification under subparagraph (A) or (G) of such section, and

        (4) an alien admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor without a visa under section 1182(l) of this title or [section 1187 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1187].

    (b) The exceptions specified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) shall not apply to a change of nonimmigrant classification to that of a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (T) or (U) of [section 1101(a)(15) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/15].
