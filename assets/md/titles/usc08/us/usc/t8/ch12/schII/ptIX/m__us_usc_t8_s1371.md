## § 1371. Reports

    Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice and the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate describing the following:

    (1) __Public charge deportations__ 

        The number of aliens deported on public charge grounds under section 1227(a)(5)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title during the previous fiscal year.

    (2) __Indigent sponsors__ 

        The number of determinations made under [section 1631(e) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1631/e] during the previous fiscal year.

    (3) __Reimbursement actions__ 

        The number of actions brought, and the amount of each action, for reimbursement under [section 1183a of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1183a] (including private collections) for the costs of providing public benefits.

([Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title V, § 565][/us/pl/104/208/s565], Sept. 30, 1996, [110 Stat. 3009–684][/us/stat/110/3009-684].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1227(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1227/a/5], referred to in par. (1), was in the original a reference to “section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act”, which has been translated as referring to section 237(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 241 as 237 by [Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title III, § 305(a)(2)][/us/pl/104/208/s305/a/2], Sept. 30, 1996, [110 Stat. 3009–598][/us/stat/110/3009-598]. [Pub. L. 104–208, § 305(a)(3)][/us/pl/104/208/s305/a/3], enacted a new section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act which is classified to [section 1231 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1231], but subsec. (a)(5) of that section does not relate to deportation on public charge grounds.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and also as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, and not as part of the Immigration and Nationality Act which comprises this chapter.

 __Abolition of Immigration and Naturalization Service and Transfer of Functions__ 

    For abolition of Immigration and Naturalization Service, transfer of functions, and treatment of related references, see note set out under [section 1551 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1551].
