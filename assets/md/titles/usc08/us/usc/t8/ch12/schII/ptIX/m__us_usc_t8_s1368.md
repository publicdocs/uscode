## § 1368. Increase in INS detention facilities; report on detention space

    (a) __Increase in detention facilities__ 

        Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Attorney General shall provide for an increase in the detention facilities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to at least 9,000 beds before the end of fiscal year 1997.

    (b) __Report on detention space__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 6 months after September 30, 1996, and every 6 months thereafter, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate estimating the amount of detention space that will be required, during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the succeeding fiscal year, to detain—

            (A) all aliens subject to detention under [section 1226(c) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1226/c] and [section 1231(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1231/a];

            (B) all inadmissible or deportable aliens subject to proceedings under [section 1228 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1228] or section 1225(b)(2)(A) or 1229a of this title; and

            (C) other inadmissible or deportable aliens in accordance with the priorities established by the Attorney General.

        (2) __Estimate of number of aliens released into the community__ 

            (A) __Criminal aliens__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The first report submitted under paragraph (1) shall include an estimate of the number of criminal aliens who, in each of the 3 fiscal years concluded prior to the date of the report—

                    (I) were released from detention facilities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (whether operated directly by the Service or through contract with other persons or agencies); or

                    (II) were not taken into custody or detention by the Service upon completion of their incarceration.

                (ii) __Aliens convicted of aggravated felonies__ 

                    The estimate under clause (i) shall estimate separately, with respect to each year described in such clause, the number of criminal aliens described in such clause who were convicted of an aggravated felony.

            (B) __All inadmissible or deportable aliens__ 

                The first report submitted under paragraph (1) shall also estimate the number of inadmissible or deportable aliens who were released into the community due to a lack of detention facilities in each of the 3 fiscal years concluded prior to the date of the report notwithstanding circumstances that the Attorney General believed justified detention (for example, a significant probability that the released alien would not appear, as agreed, at subsequent exclusion or deportation proceedings).

            (C) __Subsequent reports__ 

                Each report under paragraph (1) following the first such report shall include the estimates under subparagraphs (A) and (B), made with respect to the 6-month period immediately preceding the date of the submission of the report.
