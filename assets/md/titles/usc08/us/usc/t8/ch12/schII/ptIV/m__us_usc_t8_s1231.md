## § 1231. Detention and removal of aliens ordered removed

    (a) __Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed__ 

        (1) __Removal period__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the “removal period”).

            (B) __Beginning of period__ 

            The removal period begins on the latest of the following:

                (i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.

                (ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court’s final order.

                (iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.

            (C) __Suspension of period__ 

                The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in detention during such extended period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien’s departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien’s removal subject to an order of removal.

        (2) __Detention__ 

            During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall the Attorney General release an alien who has been found inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title.

        (3) __Supervision after 90-day period__ 

        If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien—

            (A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for identification;

            (B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States Government;

            (C) to give information under oath about the alien’s nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and other information the Attorney General considers appropriate; and

            (D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien’s conduct or activities that the Attorney General prescribes for the alien.

        (4) __Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, supervised release, or probation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in section 259(a)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 42 and paragraph (2), <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “subparagraph (B),”. </sup></sup>  the Attorney General may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.

            (B) __Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of sentence of imprisonment__ 

            The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in accordance with applicable procedures under this chapter before the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment—

                (i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense related to smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this title  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis. </sup></sup>  and (II) the removal of the alien is appropriate and in the best interest of the United States; or

                (ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or a political subdivision of a State), if the chief State official exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of the alien determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III) submits a written request to the Attorney General that such alien be so removed.

            (C) __Notice__ 

                Any alien removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be notified of the penalties under the laws of the United States relating to the reentry of deported aliens, particularly the expanded penalties for aliens removed under subparagraph (B).

            (D) __No private right__ 

                No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph against any official of the United States or of any State to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or removal of any alien.

        (5) __Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering__ 

            If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.

        (6) __Inadmissible or criminal aliens__ 

            An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under [section 1182 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182], removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).

        (7) __Employment authorization__ 

        No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific finding that—

            (A) the alien cannot be removed due to the refusal of all countries designated by the alien or under this section to receive the alien, or

            (B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.

                An alien may designate under subparagraph (A)(i) a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, an adjacent island, or an island adjacent to a foreign territory contiguous to the United States as the place to which the alien is to be removed only if the alien is a native, citizen, subject, or national of, or has resided in, that designated territory or island.

            (C) __Disregarding designation__ 

            The Attorney General may disregard a designation under subparagraph (A)(i) if—

                (i) the alien fails to designate a country promptly;

                (ii) the government of the country does not inform the Attorney General finally, within 30 days after the date the Attorney General first inquires, whether the government will accept the alien into the country;

            (D) __Alternative country__ 

            If an alien is not removed to a country designated under subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney General shall remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen unless the government of the country—

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

The previous sentence shall not preclude the Attorney General from determining that, notwithstanding the length of sentence imposed, an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime. For purposes of clause (iv), an alien who is described in [section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1227/a/4/B] shall be considered to be an alien with respect to whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the United States.

            (C) __Sustaining burden of proof; credibility determinations__

         If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate, a political subdivision of the State) exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien submits a written request to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General—

            (A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for compensation to the State or a political subdivision of the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incarceration of the undocumented criminal alien; or

            (B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the custody of the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.

        (2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the average cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as determined by the Attorney General.

                (ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation proceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State; or

                (iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under [section 1258 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1258], or to comply with the conditions of any such status.

        (4)

            (A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens who have committed aggravated felonies.

            (B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented criminal aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to this subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of security appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.

            (A) $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;

            (B) $850,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and
