For purposes of this clause, an alien who has filed a petition under clause (iii) or (iv) of [section 1154(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1154/a/1/A] remains an immediate relative in the event that the United States citizen spouse or parent loses United States citizenship on account of the abuse.

            (A)

             The worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants under this subsection for a fiscal year is, subject to subparagraph (B), equal to—

        (3)

            (A) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year 1992 is zero.

            (B) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year 1993 is the difference (if any) between the worldwide level established under paragraph (1) for the previous fiscal year and the number of visas issued under [section 1153(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a] during that fiscal year.

            (C) The number computed under this paragraph for a subsequent fiscal year is the difference (if any) between the maximum number of visas which may be issued under [section 1153(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/b] (relating to employment-based immigrants) during the previous fiscal year and the number of visas issued under that section during that year.

        (4)

         The number computed under this paragraph for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1999) is the number of aliens who were paroled into the United States under [section 1182(d)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/d/5] in the second preceding fiscal year—

            (A) who did not depart from the United States (without advance parole) within 365 days; and

            (B) who (i) did not acquire the status of aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence in the two preceding fiscal years, or (ii) acquired such status in such years under a provision of law (other than subsection (b) of this section) which exempts such adjustment from the numerical limitation on the worldwide level of immigration under this section.

        (5) If any alien described in paragraph (4) (other than an alien described in paragraph (4)(B)(ii)) is subsequently admitted as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such alien shall not again be considered for purposes of paragraph (1).

            (A) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year 1992 is zero.

            (B) The number computed under this paragraph for fiscal year 1993 is the difference (if any) between the worldwide level established under paragraph (1) for the previous fiscal year and the number of visas issued under [section 1153(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/b] during that fiscal year.

            (C) The number computed under this paragraph for a subsequent fiscal year is the difference (if any) between the maximum number of visas which may be issued under [section 1153(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a] (relating to family-sponsored immigrants) during the previous fiscal year and the number of visas issued under that section during that year.

    (e) __Worldwide level of diversity immigrants__ 

        The worldwide level of diversity immigrants is equal to 55,000 for each fiscal year.

    (f) __Rules for determining whether certain aliens are immediate relatives__ 

        (1) __Age on petition filing date__

        (2) __Age on parent’s naturalization date__

        (3) __Age on marriage termination date__
