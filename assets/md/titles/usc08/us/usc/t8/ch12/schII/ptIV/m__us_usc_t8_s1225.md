## § 1225. Inspection by immigration officers; expedited removal of inadmissible arriving aliens; referral for hearing

    (a) __Inspection__ 

        (1) __Aliens treated as applicants for admission__ 

            An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.

        (2) __Stowaways__ 

            An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158] or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B). A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stowaway is found to have a credible fear of persecution under subsection (b)(1)(B). In no case may a stowaway be considered an applicant for admission or eligible for a hearing under [section 1229a of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1229a].

        (3) __Inspection__ 

            All aliens (including alien crewmen) who are applicants for admission or otherwise seeking admission or readmission to or transit through the United States shall be inspected by immigration officers.

        (4) __Withdrawal of application for admission__ 

            An alien applying for admission may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and at any time, be permitted to withdraw the application for admission and depart immediately from the United States.

        (5) __Statements__ 

            An applicant for admission may be required to state under oath any information sought by an immigration officer regarding the purposes and intentions of the applicant in seeking admission to the United States, including the applicant’s intended length of stay and whether the applicant intends to remain permanently or become a United States citizen, and whether the applicant is inadmissible.

    (b) __Inspection of applicants for admission__ 

        (1) __Inspection of aliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled__ 

            (A) __Screening__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158] or a fear of persecution.

                (ii) __Claims for asylum__ 

                    If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158] or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).

                (iii) __Application to certain other aliens__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The Attorney General may apply clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph to any or all aliens described in subclause (II) as designated by the Attorney General. Such designation shall be in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General and may be modified at any time.

                    (II) __Aliens described__ 

                        An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not described in subparagraph (F), who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.

            (B) __Asylum interviews__ 

                (i) __Conduct by asylum officers__ 

                    An asylum officer shall conduct interviews of aliens referred under subparagraph (A)(ii), either at a port of entry or at such other place designated by the Attorney General.

                (ii) __Referral of certain aliens__ 

                    If the officer determines at the time of the interview that an alien has a credible fear of persecution (within the meaning of clause (v)), the alien shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.

                (iii) __Removal without further review if no credible fear of persecution__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review.

                    (II) __Record of determination__ 

                        The officer shall prepare a written record of a determination under subclause (I). Such record shall include a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant, such additional facts (if any) relied upon by the officer, and the officer’s analysis of why, in the light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution. A copy of the officer’s interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.

                    (III) __Review of determination__ 

                        The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon the alien’s request for prompt review by an immigration judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the alien does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the date of the determination under subclause (I).

                    (IV) __Mandatory detention__ 

                        Any alien subject to the procedures under this clause shall be detained pending a final determination of credible fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed.

                (iv) __Information about interviews__ 

                    The Attorney General shall provide information concerning the asylum interview described in this subparagraph to aliens who may be eligible. An alien who is eligible for such interview may consult with a person or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the interview or any review thereof, according to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Such consultation shall be at no expense to the Government and shall not unreasonably delay the process.

                (v) __“Credible fear of persecution” defined__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “credible fear of persecution” means that there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158].

            (C) __Limitation on administrative review__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal order entered in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt review of such an order under subparagraph (A)(i) against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under penalty of perjury under [section 1746 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1746], after having been warned of the penalties for falsely making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under [section 1157 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1157], or to have been granted asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158].

            (D) __Limit on collateral attacks__ 

                In any action brought against an alien under [section 1325(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1325/a] or [section 1326 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1326], the court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity of an order of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii).

            (E) __“Asylum officer” defined__ 

            As used in this paragraph, the term “asylum officer” means an immigration officer who—

                (i) has had professional training in country conditions, asylum law, and interview techniques comparable to that provided to full-time adjudicators of applications under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158], and

                (ii) is supervised by an officer who meets the condition described in clause (i) and has had substantial experience adjudicating asylum applications.

            (F) __Exception__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien who is a native or citizen of a country in the Western Hemisphere with whose government the United States does not have full diplomatic relations and who arrives by aircraft at a port of entry.

            (G) __Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands__ 

                Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize or require any person described in [section 1158(e) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158/e] to be permitted to apply for asylum under [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1158] at any time before January 1, 2014.

        (2) __Inspection of other aliens__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under [section 1229a of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1229a].

            (B) __Exception__ 

            Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien—

                (i) who is a crewman,

                (ii) to whom paragraph (1) applies, or

                (iii) who is a stowaway.

            (C) __Treatment of aliens arriving from contiguous territory__ 

                In the case of an alien described in subparagraph (A) who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under [section 1229a of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1229a].

        (3) __Challenge of decision__ 

            The decision of the examining immigration officer, if favorable to the admission of any alien, shall be subject to challenge by any other immigration officer and such challenge shall operate to take the alien whose privilege to be admitted is so challenged, before an immigration judge for a proceeding under [section 1229a of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1229a].

    (c) __Removal of aliens inadmissible on security and related grounds__ 

        (1) __Removal without further hearing__ 

        If an immigration officer or an immigration judge suspects that an arriving alien may be inadmissible under subparagraph (A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of [section 1182(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/3], the officer or judge shall—

            (A) order the alien removed, subject to review under paragraph (2);

            (C) not conduct any further inquiry or hearing until ordered by the Attorney General.

        (2) __Review of order__ 

            (A) The Attorney General shall review orders issued under paragraph (1).

            (B)

             If the Attorney General—

                (i) is satisfied on the basis of confidential information that the alien is inadmissible under subparagraph (A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of [section 1182(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/3], and

                (ii) after consulting with appropriate security agencies of the United States Government, concludes that disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security,

                the Attorney General may order the alien removed without further inquiry or hearing by an immigration judge.

            (C) If the Attorney General does not order the removal of the alien under subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall specify the further inquiry or hearing that shall be conducted in the case.

        (3) __Submission of statement and information__
