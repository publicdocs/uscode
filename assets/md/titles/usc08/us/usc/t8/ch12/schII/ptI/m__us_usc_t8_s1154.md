        (2)

            (A)

             The Attorney General may not approve a spousal second preference petition for the classification of the spouse of an alien if the alien, by virtue of a prior marriage, has been accorded the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as the spouse of a citizen of the United States or as the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, unless—

                (i) a period of 5 years has elapsed after the date the alien acquired the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or

                (ii) the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney General by clear and convincing evidence that the prior marriage (on the basis of which the alien obtained the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence) was not entered into for the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws.

                In this subparagraph, the term “spousal second preference petition” refers to a petition, seeking preference status under [section 1153(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a/2], for an alien as a spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

            (B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a petition filed for the classification of the spouse of an alien if the prior marriage of the alien was terminated by the death of his or her spouse.

    (b) __Investigation; consultation; approval; authorization to grant preference status__ 

        After an investigation of the facts in each case, and after consultation with the Secretary of Labor with respect to petitions to accord a status under section 1153(b)(2) or 1153(b)(3) of this title, the Attorney General shall, if he determines that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative specified in [section 1151(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/b] or is eligible for preference under subsection (a) or (b) of [section 1153 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153], approve the petition and forward one copy thereof to the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall then authorize the consular officer concerned to grant the preference status.

    (c) __Limitation on orphan petitions approved for a single petitioner; prohibition against approval in cases of marriages entered into in order to evade immigration laws; restriction on future entry of aliens involved with marriage fraud__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section no petition shall be approved if (1) the alien has previously been accorded, or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States or the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, or (2) the Attorney General has determined that the alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.

    (d) __Recommendation of valid home-study__ 

        (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section no petition may be approved on behalf of a child defined in subparagraph (F) or (G) of [section 1101(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/b/1] unless a valid home-study has been favorably recommended by an agency of the State of the child’s proposed residence, or by an agency authorized by that State to conduct such a study, or, in the case of a child adopted abroad, by an appropriate public or private adoption agency which is licensed in the United States.

        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no petition may be approved on behalf of a child defined in [section 1101(b)(1)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/b/1/G] unless the Secretary of State has certified that the central authority of the child’s country of origin has notified the United States central authority under the convention referred to in such [section 1101(b)(1)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/b/1/G] that a United States citizen habitually resident in the United States has effected final adoption of the child, or has been granted custody of the child for the purpose of emigration and adoption, in accordance with such convention and the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 \[[42 U.S.C. 14901][/us/usc/t42/s14901] et seq.\].

    (e) __Subsequent finding of non-entitlement to preference classification__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle an immigrant, in behalf of whom a petition under this section is approved, to be admitted  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by “to”. </sup></sup>  the United States as an immigrant under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of [section 1153 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153] or as an immediate relative under [section 1151(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/b] if upon his arrival at a port of entry in the United States he is found not to be entitled to such classification.

    (f) __Preferential treatment for children fathered by United States citizens and born in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, or Thailand after 1950 and before__  __October 22, 1982__ 

        (1) Any alien claiming to be an alien described in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection (or any person on behalf of such an alien) may file a petition with the Attorney General for classification under section 1151(b), 1153(a)(1), or 1153(a)(3) of this title, as appropriate. After an investigation of the facts of each case the Attorney General shall, if the conditions described in paragraph (2) are met, approve the petition and forward one copy to the Secretary of State.

        (2)

         The Attorney General may approve a petition for an alien under paragraph (1) if—

            (A) he has reason to believe that the alien (i) was born in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, or Thailand after 1950 and before October 22, 1982, and (ii) was fathered by a United States citizen;

            (A) the beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for classification as an immediate relative (as described in [section 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/b/2/A/i]);
