    (b) __Rules for chargeability__ 

        Each independent country, self-governing dominion, mandated territory, and territory under the international trusteeship system of the United Nations, other than the United States and its outlying possessions, shall be treated as a separate foreign state for the purposes of a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) when approved by the Secretary of State. All other inhabited lands shall be attributed to a foreign state specified by the Secretary of State. For the purposes of this chapter the foreign state to which an immigrant is chargeable shall be determined by birth within such foreign state except that (1) an alien child, when accompanied by or following to join his alien parent or parents, may be charged to the foreign state of either parent if such parent has received or would be qualified for an immigrant visa, if necessary to prevent the separation of the child from the parent or parents, and if immigration charged to the foreign state to which such parent has been or would be chargeable has not reached a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) for that fiscal year; (2) if an alien is chargeable to a different foreign state from that of his spouse, the foreign state to which such alien is chargeable may, if necessary to prevent the separation of husband and wife, be determined by the foreign state of the spouse he is accompanying or following to join, if such spouse has received or would be qualified for an immigrant visa and if immigration charged to the foreign state to which such spouse has been or would be chargeable has not reached a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) for that fiscal year; (3) an alien born in the United States shall be considered as having been born in the country of which he is a citizen or subject, or, if he is not a citizen or subject of any country, in the last foreign country in which he had his residence as determined by the consular officer; and (4) an alien born within any foreign state in which neither of his parents was born and in which neither of his parents had a residence at the time of such alien’s birth may be charged to the foreign state of either parent.

    (c) __Chargeability for dependent areas__ 

        Any immigrant born in a colony or other component or dependent area of a foreign state overseas from the foreign state, other than an alien described in [section 1151(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/b], shall be chargeable for the purpose of the limitation set forth in subsection (a), to the foreign state.

    (d) __Changes in territory__ 

        In the case of any change in the territorial limits of foreign states, the Secretary of State shall, upon recognition of such change issue appropriate instructions to all diplomatic and consular offices.

    (e) __Special rules for countries at ceiling__ 

    If it is determined that the total number of immigrant visas made available under subsections (a) and (b) of [section 1153 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153] to natives of any single foreign state or dependent area will exceed the numerical limitation specified in subsection (a)(2) in any fiscal year, in determining the allotment of immigrant visa numbers to natives under subsections (a) and (b) of [section 1153 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153], visa numbers with respect to natives of that state or area shall be allocated (to the extent practicable and otherwise consistent with this section and [section 1153 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153]) in a manner so that—

        (1) the ratio of the visa numbers made available under [section 1153(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a] to the visa numbers made available under [section 1153(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/b] is equal to the ratio of the worldwide level of immigration under [section 1151(c) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/c] to such level under [section 1151(d) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1151/d];

        (2) except as provided in subsection (a)(4), the proportion of the visa numbers made available under each of paragraphs (1) through (4) of [section 1153(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a] is equal to the ratio of the total number of visas made available under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas made available under [section 1153(a) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a], and

        (3) except as provided in subsection (a)(5), the proportion of the visa numbers made available under each of paragraphs (1) through (5) of [section 1153(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/b] is equal to the ratio of the total number of visas made available under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas made available under [section 1153(b) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/b].

        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the number of visas that may be issued to natives of a foreign state or dependent area under section 1153(a) or 1153(b) of this title if there is insufficient demand for visas for such natives under section 1153(b) or 1153(a) of this title, respectively, or as limiting the number of visas that may be issued under [section 1153(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1153/a/2/A] pursuant to subsection (a)(4)(A).
