            (A) __Release hearing__ 

            An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence shall be entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned to hear the removal hearing. Such an alien shall be detained pending the removal hearing, unless the alien demonstrates to the court that the alien—

                (ii) if released upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe (including the posting of any monetary amount), is not likely to flee; and

                (iii) will not endanger national security, or the safety of any person or the community, if released.

            (B) __Information considered__ 

                The judge may consider classified information submitted in camera and ex parte in making a determination whether to release an alien pending the removal hearing.

        (3) __Release if order denied and no review sought__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), if a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an application filed pursuant to [section 1533 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1533], and the Attorney General does not seek review of such denial, the alien shall be released from custody.

            (B) __Application of regular procedures__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not prevent the arrest and detention of the alien pursuant to subchapter II of this chapter.

    (b) __Conditional release if order denied and review sought__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If a judge of the removal court denies the order sought in an application filed pursuant to [section 1533 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1533] and the Attorney General seeks review of such denial, the judge shall release the alien from custody subject to the least restrictive condition, or combination of conditions, of release described in section 3142(b) and clauses (i) through (xiv) of [section 3142(c)(1)(B) of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s3142/c/1/B] that—

            (A) will reasonably assure the appearance of the alien at any future proceeding pursuant to this subchapter; and

            (B) will not endanger the safety of any other person or the community.

        (2) __No release for certain aliens__ 

            If the judge finds no such condition or combination of conditions, as described in paragraph (1), the alien shall remain in custody until the completion of any appeal authorized by this subchapter.
