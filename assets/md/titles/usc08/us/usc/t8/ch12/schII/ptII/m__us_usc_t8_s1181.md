## § 1181. Admission of immigrants into the United States

    (a) __Documents required; admission under quotas before__  __June 30, 1968__

With respect to immigrants to be admitted under quotas of quota areas prior to June 30, 1968, no immigrant visa shall be deemed valid unless the immigrant is properly chargeable to the quota area under the quota of which the visa is issued.

        Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 1182(a)(7)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/7/A] in such cases or in such classes of cases and under such conditions as may be by regulations prescribed, returning resident immigrants, defined in [section 1101(a)(27)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/27/A], who are otherwise admissible may be readmitted to the United States by the Attorney General in his discretion without being required to obtain a passport, immigrant visa, reentry permit or other documentation.

    (c) __Nonapplicability to aliens admitted as refugees__ 

        The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to an alien whom the Attorney General admits to the United States under [section 1157 of this title][/us/usc/t8/s1157].
