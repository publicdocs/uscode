## § 1306. Design notice

    (a)  __Contents of Design Notice__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         Whenever any design for which protection is sought under this chapter is made public under section 1310(b), the owner of the design shall, subject to the provisions of section 1307, mark it or have it marked legibly with a design notice consisting of—

            (A) the words “Protected Design”, the abbreviation “Prot’d Des.”, or the letter “D” with a circle, or the symbol “\*D\*”;

            (B) the year of the date on which protection for the design commenced; and

            (C) the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally accepted alternative designation of the owner.

            Any distinctive identification of the owner may be used for purposes of subparagraph (C) if it has been recorded by the Administrator before the design marked with such identification is registered.

        (2) After registration, the registration number may be used instead of the elements specified in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1).

    (b)  __Location of Notice__  __.—__ 

    The design notice shall be so located and applied as to give reasonable notice of design protection while the useful article embodying the design is passing through its normal channels of commerce.

    (c)  __Subsequent Removal of Notice__  __.—__ 

    When the owner of a design has complied with the provisions of this section, protection under this chapter shall not be affected by the removal, destruction, or obliteration by others of the design notice on an article.
