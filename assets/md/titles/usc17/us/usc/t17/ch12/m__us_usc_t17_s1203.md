## § 1203. Civil remedies

    (a)  __Civil Actions__  __.—__ 

    Any person injured by a violation of section 1201 or 1202 may bring a civil action in an appropriate United States district court for such violation.

    (b)  __Powers of the Court__  __.—__ 

    In an action brought under subsection (a), the court—

        (1) may grant temporary and permanent injunctions on such terms as it deems reasonable to prevent or restrain a violation, but in no event shall impose a prior restraint on free speech or the press protected under the 1st amendment to the Constitution;

        (2) at any time while an action is pending, may order the impounding, on such terms as it deems reasonable, of any device or product that is in the custody or control of the alleged violator and that the court has reasonable cause to believe was involved in a violation;

        (3) may award damages under subsection (c);

        (4) in its discretion may allow the recovery of costs by or against any party other than the United States or an officer thereof;

        (5) in its discretion may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party; and

        (6) may, as part of a final judgment or decree finding a violation, order the remedial modification or the destruction of any device or product involved in the violation that is in the custody or control of the violator or has been impounded under paragraph (2).

    (c) __Award of Damages.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this title, a person committing a violation of section 1201 or 1202 is liable for either—

            (A) the actual damages and any additional profits of the violator, as provided in paragraph (2), or

            (B) statutory damages, as provided in paragraph (3).

        (2)  __Actual damages__  __.—__ 

        The court shall award to the complaining party the actual damages suffered by the party as a result of the violation, and any profits of the violator that are attributable to the violation and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages, if the complaining party elects such damages at any time before final judgment is entered.

        (3)  __Statutory damages__  __.—__ 

            (A) At any time before final judgment is entered, a complaining party may elect to recover an award of statutory damages for each violation of section 1201 in the sum of not less than $200 or more than $2,500 per act of circumvention, device, product, component, offer, or performance of service, as the court considers just.

            (B) At any time before final judgment is entered, a complaining party may elect to recover an award of statutory damages for each violation of section 1202 in the sum of not less than $2,500 or more than $25,000.

        (4)  __Repeated violations__  __.—__ 

        In any case in which the injured party sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that a person has violated section 1201 or 1202 within 3 years after a final judgment was entered against the person for another such violation, the court may increase the award of damages up to triple the amount that would otherwise be awarded, as the court considers just.

        (5) __Innocent violations.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            The court in its discretion may reduce or remit the total award of damages in any case in which the violator sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation.

            (B) __Nonprofit library, archives, educational institutions, or public broadcasting entities.—__ 

                (i)  __Definition__  __.—__ 

                In this subparagraph, the term “public broadcasting entity” has the meaning given such term under section 118(f).

                (ii)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                In the case of a nonprofit library, archives, educational institution, or public broadcasting entity, the court shall remit damages in any case in which the library, archives, educational institution, or public broadcasting entity sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that the library, archives, educational institution, or public broadcasting entity was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation.
