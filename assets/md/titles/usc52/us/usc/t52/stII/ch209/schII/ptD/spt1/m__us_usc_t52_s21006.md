## § 21006. Requirement for public notice and comment

    For purposes of section 21001(a)(1)(C)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, a State plan meets the public notice and comment requirements of this section if—

    (1) not later than 30 days prior to the submission of the plan, the State made a preliminary version of the plan available for public inspection and comment;

    (2) the State publishes notice that the preliminary version of the plan is so available; and

    (3) the State took the public comments made regarding the preliminary version of the plan into account in preparing the plan which was filed with the Commission.

([Pub. L. 107–252, title II, § 256][/us/pl/107/252/s256], Oct. 29, 2002, [116 Stat. 1697][/us/stat/116/1697].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 21001(a)(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t52/s21001/a/1/C], referred to in text, probably should be a reference to [section 21003(b)(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t52/s21003/b/1/C] because there is no subsec. (a)(1)(C) in section 21001 and subsec. (b)(1)(C) of section 21003 relates to public notice and comment requirements of [section 21006 of this title][/us/usc/t52/s21006].

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 15406 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s15406], The Public Health and Welfare, prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.
