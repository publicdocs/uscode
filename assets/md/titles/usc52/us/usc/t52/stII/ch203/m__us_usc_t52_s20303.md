## § 20303. Federal write-in absentee ballot in general elections for Federal office for absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Federal write-in absentee ballot__ 

            The Presidential designee shall prescribe a Federal write-in absentee ballot (including a secrecy envelope and mailing envelope for such ballot) for use in general, special, primary, and runoff elections for Federal office by absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters who make timely application for, and do not receive, States, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “States’ ”. </sup></sup>  absentee ballots.

        (2) __Promotion and expansion of use of Federal write-in absentee ballots__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Not later than December 31, 2011, the Presidential designee shall adopt procedures to promote and expand the use of the Federal write-in absentee ballot as a back-up measure to vote in elections for Federal office.

            (B) __Use of technology__ 

            Under such procedures, the Presidential designee shall utilize technology to implement a system under which the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may—

                (i) enter the address of the voter or other information relevant in the appropriate jurisdiction of the State, and the system will generate a list of all candidates in the election for Federal office in that jurisdiction; and

                (ii) submit the marked Federal write-in absentee ballot by printing the ballot (including complete instructions for submitting the marked Federal write-in absentee ballot to the appropriate State election official and the mailing address of the single State office designated under [section 20302(b) of this title][/us/usc/t52/s20302/b]).

            (C) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

                There are authorized to be appropriated to the Presidential designee such sums as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.

    (b) __Submission and processing__ 

    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a Federal write-in absentee ballot shall be submitted and processed in the manner provided by law for absentee ballots in the State involved. A Federal write-in absentee ballot of an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter shall not be counted—

        (1) in the case of a ballot submitted by an overseas voter who is not an absent uniformed services voter, if the ballot is submitted from any location in the United States;

        (2)

         if the application of the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter for a State absentee ballot is received by the appropriate State election official after the later of—

            (A) the deadline of the State for receipt of such application; or

            (B) the date that is 30 days before the general election; or

        (3) if a State absentee ballot of the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter is received by the appropriate State election official not later than the deadline for receipt of the State absentee ballot under State law.

    (c) __Special rules__ 

    The following rules shall apply with respect to Federal write-in absentee ballots:

        (1) In completing the ballot, the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may designate a candidate by writing in the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a political party (in which case the ballot shall be counted for the candidate of that political party).

        (2) In the case of the offices of President and Vice President, a vote for a named candidate or a vote by writing in the name of a political party shall be counted as a vote for the electors supporting the candidate involved.

        (3) Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, if the intention of the voter can be ascertained.

    (d) __Second ballot submission; instruction to absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter__ 

        An absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives a State absentee ballot, may submit the State absentee ballot. The Presidential designee shall assure that the instructions for each Federal write-in absentee ballot clearly state that an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives and submits a State absentee ballot should make every reasonable effort to inform the appropriate State election official that the voter has submitted more than one ballot.

    (e) __Use of approved State absentee ballot in place of Federal write-in absentee ballot__ 

    The Federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be valid for use in a general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office if the State involved provides a State absentee ballot that—

        (1) at the request of the State, is approved by the Presidential designee for use in place of the Federal write-in absentee ballot; and

        (2) is made available to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters at least 60 days before the deadline for receipt of the State ballot under State law.

    (f) __Prohibiting refusal to accept ballot for failure to meet certain requirements__ 

    A State shall not refuse to accept and process any otherwise valid Federal write-in absentee ballot submitted in any manner by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter solely on the basis of the following:

        (1) Notarization requirements.

        (2) Restrictions on paper type, including weight and size.

        (3) Restrictions on envelope type, including weight and size.

    (g) __Certain States exempted__ 

    A State is not required to permit use of the Federal write-in absentee ballot, if, on and after August 28, 1986, the State has in effect a law providing that—

        (1) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any voter described in [section 20310(5)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t52/s20310/5/A] at least 90 days before the general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office involved; and

        (2) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any voter described in section 20310(5)(B) or (C) of this title, as soon as the official list of candidates in the general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office is complete.
