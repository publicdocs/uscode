            (C) the limits under subsection (d) 1 with respect to any expenditure by a State or national committee of a political party on behalf of the candidate shall not apply.

        (2) __Determination of opposition personal funds amount__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The opposition personal funds amount is an amount equal to the excess (if any) of—

                (ii) the aggregate amount of expenditures from personal funds made by the candidate with respect to the election.

            (B) __Special rule for candidate’s campaign funds__ 

                (i) __In general__

            (B) __Effect of withdrawal of an opposing candidate__ 

                A candidate and a candidate’s authorized committee shall not accept any contribution and a party shall not make any expenditure under the increased limit after the date on which an opposing candidate ceases to be a candidate to the extent that the amount of such increased limit is attributable to such an opposing candidate.
