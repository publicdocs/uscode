        (4) compile and maintain a current list of all reports and statements pertaining to each candidate.

    (c) __Waiver; electronic access__ 

        Subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to any State that, as determined by the Commission, has a system that permits electronic access to, and duplication of, reports and statements that are filed with the Commission.
