Subject to the provisions of sections 823a and 831 of this title, while assigned to duty, qualified Auxiliary pilots shall be deemed to be Coast Guard pilots.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 266a ([Feb. 19, 1941, ch. 8][/us/act/1941-02-19/ch8], title I, § 7A, as added [Sept. 30, 1944, ch. 453, § 4][/us/act/1944-09-30/ch453/s4], [58 Stat. 760][/us/stat/58/760]).

    The last clause of said section is eliminated because it might be construed to exempt planes of members from being licensed according to law.
