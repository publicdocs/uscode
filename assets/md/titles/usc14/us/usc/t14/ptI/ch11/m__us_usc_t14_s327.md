## § 327. Officers considered for removal; retirement or discharge; separation benefits

    (a)

     At any time during proceedings under section 322 or 323 of this title, and before the removal of an officer, the Secretary may grant a request—

        (1) for voluntary retirement, if the officer is otherwise qualified therefor; or

        (2) for discharge with separation benefits under [section 286(c) of this title][/us/usc/t14/s286/c].

    (b)

     Each officer removed from active duty under [section 326 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s326] shall—

        (1) if on the date of removal the officer is eligible for voluntary retirement under any law, be retired in the grade for which he would be eligible if retired at his request; or

        (2) if on that date the officer is ineligible for voluntary retirement under any law, be honorably discharged with separation benefits under [section 286(c) of this title][/us/usc/t14/s286/c], unless under regulations promulgated by the Secretary the condition under which the officer is discharged does not warrant an honorable discharge.
