    (c) If a portion of a loan is repaid under this section for any year, interest on the remainder of such loan shall accrue and be paid in the same manner as is otherwise required.

    (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize refunding any repayment of a loan.

    (e) The Secretary shall, by regulation, prescribe a schedule for the allocation of funds made available to carry out this section during any year for which funds are not sufficient to pay the sum of the amounts eligible for repayment under subsection (a).
