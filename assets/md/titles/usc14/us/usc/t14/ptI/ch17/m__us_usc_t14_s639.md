No individual, association, partnership, or corporation shall falsely advertise, or otherwise represent falsely by any device whatsoever, that any project or business in which he or it is engaged, or product which he or it manufactures, deals in, or sells, has been in any way endorsed, authorized, or approved by the Coast Guard.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 546][/us/stat/63/546]; [Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, § 30][/us/act/1950-08-03/ch536/s30], [64 Stat. 408][/us/stat/64/408]; [Pub. L. 113–281, title II, § 205(b)][/us/pl/113/281/s205/b], Dec. 18, 2014, [128 Stat. 3025][/us/stat/128/3025].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section makes the unauthorized use of the words “Coast Guard” or any derivative thereof, a crime. This is believed to be a desirable prohibition in view of the many commercial organizations which are manufacturing equipment approved by the Coast Guard and selling same to vessels in the United States. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    2014—[Pub. L. 113–281][/us/pl/113/281] substituted “$10,000” for “$1,000”.

    1950—Act Aug. 3, 1950, made it possible for Commandant to grant authority to private business organizations to use terms or designations otherwise prohibited by this section.

 __Coast Guard City, USA__ 

[Pub. L. 105–383, title IV, § 409][/us/pl/105/383/s409], Nov. 13, 1998, [112 Stat. 3431][/us/stat/112/3431], provided that: 

> “The Commandant of the Coast Guard may recognize the community of Grand Haven, Michigan, as ‘Coast Guard City, USA’. If the Commandant desires to recognize any other community in the same manner or any other community requests such recognition from the Coast Guard, the Commandant shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives 90 days prior to approving such recognition.”
