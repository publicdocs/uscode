## § 422. Status of recalled personnel

    All retired personnel when recalled to active duty shall serve in the grade or rate in which they were serving at the time of retirement.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 524][/us/stat/63/524]; [Pub. L. 99–348, title II][/us/pl/99/348/tII], § 205(b)(10), July 1, 1986, [100 Stat. 700][/us/stat/100/700].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This provision is desirable because many enlisted men and low-ranking officers may now retire with higher grade which they previously held on a temporary basis. If recalled in the higher grades, they might not be capable of holding same at the time of recall. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–348][/us/pl/99/348] substituted “rate” for “rating”.
