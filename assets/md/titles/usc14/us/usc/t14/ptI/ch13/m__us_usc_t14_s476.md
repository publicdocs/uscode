## § 476. Contingent expenses

    The Commandant may expend for contingencies of the Coast Guard a sum not to exceed $50,000 in any one fiscal year.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 532][/us/stat/63/532]; [Pub. L. 108–293, title II][/us/pl/108/293/tII], § 219, Aug. 9, 2004, [118 Stat. 1039][/us/stat/118/1039].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 15k ([Apr. 20, 1939, ch. 75][/us/act/1939-04-20/ch75], [53 Stat. 582][/us/stat/53/582]).

    The limitation on the amount for such contingencies is increased, and the amount is made available to the Commandant rather than solely to the Superintendent of the Academy as now prescribed by law. The authorization is to cover expenditures incident to the offices of the Commandant and the Superintendent of the Academy. The intent is that the amount authorized will be administered in a manner similar to that now employed by the Superintendent of the Academy under the authority of 14 U.S.C., § 15k. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–293][/us/pl/108/293] substituted “$50,000” for “$7,500” and struck out at end “The Commandant may authorize the Superintendent of the Academy to expend not to exceed $2,500 of this amount for contingencies of the Academy.”
