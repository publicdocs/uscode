## § 644. Payment for the apprehension of stragglers

    The Coast Guard may offer and pay rewards for the apprehension and delivery of deserters, stragglers, and prisoners.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 547][/us/stat/63/547].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 147 ([May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, § 5][/us/act/1906-05-26/ch2556/s5], [34 Stat. 200][/us/stat/34/200]).

    Said section has been divided. That part relating to rewards for the apprehension of deserters is placed in this section. That part relating to the acceptance of convicted deserters in the armed forces is placed in [section 575 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s575]. The first sentence of said section is eliminated inasmuch as it is believed that commanding officers in the Coast Guard are charged with the duty of apprehending deserters without special statutory authority therefor.

    The limitation as to amount that could be offered is removed.

    The provision concerning money due the deserter is eliminated. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
