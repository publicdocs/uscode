 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 11a, 12 ([Apr. 16, 1908, ch. 145][/us/act/1908-04-16/ch145], §§ 1, 2, [35 Stat. 61][/us/stat/35/61]; [Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, § 1][/us/act/1915-01-28/ch20/s1], [38 Stat. 800][/us/stat/38/800]; [Jan. 12, 1923, ch. 25, § 2][/us/act/1923-01-12/ch25/s2], [42 Stat. 1130][/us/stat/42/1130]; [May 24, 1939, ch. 148][/us/act/1939-05-24/ch148], §§ 2, 3, [53 Stat. 757][/us/stat/53/757]; [June 6, 1940, ch. 257][/us/act/1940-06-06/ch257], §§ 1(b), 3, [54 Stat. 246][/us/stat/54/246]; [July 23, 1947, ch. 301, § 2][/us/act/1947-07-23/ch301/s2], [61 Stat. 410][/us/stat/61/410]; [May 19, 1948, ch. 305][/us/act/1948-05-19/ch305], [62 Stat. 239][/us/stat/62/239]).

    Said sections have been divided. The provisions of the proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 11a, and the first proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 12, are placed in [section 48 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s48] and the remainder is placed in this section.

    The provisions regarding appointment of the Assistant Commandant and Engineer in Chief are coordinated, inasmuch as these positions are about equal in the Coast Guard organization. The qualification that the Engineer in Chief be appointed from the active list of engineering officers is changed to the active list of officers who have qualified for engineering duty, because there is no longer any provision for a corps of engineering officers. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
