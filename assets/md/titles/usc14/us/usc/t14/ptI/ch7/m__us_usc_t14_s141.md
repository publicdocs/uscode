## § 141. Cooperation with other agencies, States, territories, and political subdivisions

    (a) The Coast Guard may, when so requested by proper authority, utilize its personnel and facilities (including members of the Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 23) to assist any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, to perform any activity for which such personnel and facilities are especially qualified. The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided under this subsection.

    (b) The Coast Guard, with the consent of the head of the agency concerned, may avail itself of such officers and employees, advice, information, and facilities of any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia as may be helpful in the performance of its duties. In connection with the utilization of personal services of employees of state or local governments, the Coast Guard may make payments for necessary traveling and per diem expenses as prescribed for Federal employees by the standardized Government travel regulations.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 505][/us/stat/63/505]; [Pub. L. 104–324, title IV][/us/pl/104/324/tIV], § 405(a), Oct. 19, 1996, [110 Stat. 3924][/us/stat/110/3924].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 756 ([Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81][/us/act/1915-03-03/ch81], § 6, [38 Stat. 928][/us/stat/38/928]), and authorizes the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other Government agencies when requested and, correlatively, authorizes the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other agencies. It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled out by statute because in times of emergency, for example floods, it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–324][/us/pl/104/324], § 405(a)(1), amended section catchline generally, substituting “Cooperation with other agencies, States, territories, and political subdivisions” for “General”.

    Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 104–324][/us/pl/104/324], § 405(a)(2), (3), inserted “(including members of the Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 23)” after “personnel and facilities” and “The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided under this subsection.” at end.

 __Medical Emergency Helicopter Transportation Services to Civilians; Authorization to Coast Guard Commandant__ 

    [Pub. L. 95–61][/us/pl/95/61], § 8, July 1, 1977, [91 Stat. 260][/us/stat/91/260], which authorized Coast Guard to assist Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in providing medical emergency helicopter services to civilians, if assistance was provided in areas of regular Coast Guard unit assignment, did not interfere with Coast Guard mission, or increase required Coast Guard operating funds, and further providing that no individual (or his estate) operating within scope of his duties under this section’s program would be civilly liable for damage caused incident thereto, was repealed and reenacted as [section 147a of this title][/us/usc/t14/s147a] by [Pub. L. 97–295][/us/pl/97/295], §§ 2(6)(A), 6(b), Oct. 12, 1982, [96 Stat. 1301][/us/stat/96/1301], 1314.
