 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§ 185, 185d ([May 24, 1939, ch. 146][/us/act/1939-05-24/ch146], §§ 1, 5, [53 Stat. 755][/us/stat/53/755]).

    Subsection (b) is new and implements the preceding subsection; it seems necessary in view of certain statutes enacted as the result of World War II.

    Subsection (c) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 185d ([May 24, 1939, ch. 146][/us/act/1939-05-24/ch146], § 5, [53 Stat. 756][/us/stat/53/756]). Said section has been divided. The first sentence is incorporated in [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s423]. The second proviso is incorporated in [section 424 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s424]. The remainder is placed in this subsection.

    Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

    “(a) Enlisted Personnel Boards shall be convened as the Commandant may prescribe to review the records of enlisted members who have twenty or more years of active military service.

    “(b) Enlisted members who have twenty or more years of active military service may be considered by the Commandant for involuntary retirement and may be retired on recommendation of a Board—

    “(1) because the member’s performance is below the standards the Commandant prescribes; or

    “(2) because of professional dereliction.

    “(c) An enlisted member under review by the Board shall be—

    “(1) notified in writing of the reasons the member is being considered for involuntary retirement;

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557], § 15(a)(3)(A), substituted reference to enlisted member for reference to enlisted man wherever appearing in subsecs. (a) to (c).
