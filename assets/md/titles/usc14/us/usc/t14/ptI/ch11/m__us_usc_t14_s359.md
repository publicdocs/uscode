## § 359. Recall to active duty during war or national emergency

    In times of war or national emergency, the Commandant may order any enlisted member on the retired list to active duty.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 522][/us/stat/63/522]; [Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, § 18][/us/act/1950-08-03/ch536/s18], [64 Stat. 407][/us/stat/64/407]; [Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(A)][/us/pl/98/557/s15/a/3/A], Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 185c ([May 24, 1939, ch. 146, § 4][/us/act/1939-05-24/ch146/s4], [53 Stat. 755][/us/stat/53/755]).

    This section was changed so as to make provisions for enlisted men parallel to similar provisions for commissioned and warrant officers (see §§ 240 and 310 of the revised title). It seems fair and equitable that similar provisions should apply to all classes of personnel insofar as practicable. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted reference to enlisted member for reference to enlisted man.

    1950—Act Aug. 3, 1950, struck out all references to pay.

 __Delegation of Authority__ 

    For delegation of authority under this section, as invoked by section 2 of Ex. Ord. No. 13223, Sept. 14, 2001, 66 F.R. 48201, as amended, to Secretary of Homeland Security when Coast Guard is not serving as part of Navy, see section 5 of Ex. Ord. No. 13223, set out as a note under [section 12302 of Title 10][/us/usc/t10/s12302], Armed Forces.
