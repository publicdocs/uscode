## § 295. Deferment of retirement or separation for medical reasons

    (a) Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary may defer the retirement or separation of a commissioned officer, other than a commissioned warrant officer, if the evaluation of the physical condition of the officer and determination of the officer’s entitlement to retirement or separation for physical disability require hospitalization, medical observation, or other physical disability processing that cannot be completed before the date on which the officer would otherwise be retired or separated.

     A deferment under subsection (a)—

        (1) may only be made with the consent of the officer involved; and
