## § 480. Flight rations

    There may be furnished to officers, enlisted members, and civilian employees, while actually engaged in flight operations, an aircraft flight ration in kind, chargeable to the proper Coast Guard appropriation, which flight ration shall be supplementary to any ration or subsistence allowance now granted to such personnel. No part of an aircraft flight ration shall be furnished without cost to any person in a travel status or to any person to whom a per diem allowance is granted in lieu of actual subsistence.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 533][/us/stat/63/533]; [Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557], § 15(a)(3)(B), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Derived from the title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 909 ([June 5, 1942, ch. 327][/us/act/1942-06-05/ch327], [56 Stat. 308][/us/stat/56/308]).

    Said section is applicable to Navy personnel only. Experience has shown that similar authority should be granted to the Coast Guard; it will operate to the benefit of Navy personnel stopping over at Coast Guard air stations as well as to the benefit of Coast Guard personnel stopping over at Naval air stations.

    The language of said section is closely paralleled.

    Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted reference to enlisted members for reference to enlisted men.
