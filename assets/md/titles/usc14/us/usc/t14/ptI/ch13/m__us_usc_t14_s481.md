## § 481. Payments at time of discharge for good of service

    Enlisted members discharged by dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or any other discharge for the good of the service, may, upon discharge, be paid a sum not to exceed $25. The sum paid shall be fixed by and in the discretion of the Commandant, and shall be paid only in cases where the person so discharged would otherwise be without funds to meet his immediate needs.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 533][/us/stat/63/533]; [Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557], § 15(a)(3)(C), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 197, and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 3a ([Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 536][/us/act/1925-03-04/ch536], § 10, [43 Stat. 1274][/us/stat/43/1274]; [Oct. 26, 1942, ch. 623][/us/act/1942-10-26/ch623], [56 Stat. 987][/us/stat/56/987]).

    Said section 197 was made applicable to the Coast Guard by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 3a whenever the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy. Experience has shown the advantage of having such a provision applicable to the Coast Guard at all times.

    Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted “Enlisted members” for “Enlisted men”.
