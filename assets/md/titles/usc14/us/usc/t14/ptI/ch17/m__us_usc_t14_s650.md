## § 650. Coast Guard Supply Fund

    (a) A Coast Guard Supply Fund is authorized. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked. In these regulations, whenever the fund is extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other accounts. Except for the materials so transferred, the fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or otherwise acquired. The fund shall be credited with the value of materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of, such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately cover the cost thereof.

    (b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations, be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary, with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels consistently with planned operations for the next year.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    A Coast Guard supply fund was established by the Naval Appropriation Act for fiscal year 1943 approved February 7, 1942, [56 Stat. 73][/us/stat/56/73]. Experience has clearly shown that it is advantageous to the Government to have permanent authorization for such a fund. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–376][/us/pl/96/376] substituted “these regulations” for “such regulations” and authorized an increase in the capital of the fund when the fund is extended to include spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked.

    1976—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 94–546][/us/pl/94/546] substituted “Office of Management and Budget” for “Bureau of the Budget”.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–278][/us/pl/91/278] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b).

    1956—Act Aug. 7, 1956, substituted “Coast Guard Supply Fund” for “Coast Guard supply fund and supply account” in section catchline, struck out provisions calling for mandatory increase of the Fund by the value of commissary provisions and uniform clothing on hand on July 1, 1949, and inserted provisions permitting the Secretary to prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked and for increasing the existing capital of the Fund.
