## § 675. Small boat station closures

    (a) __Closures.—__ 

    The Secretary may not close a Coast Guard multimission small boat station or subunit unless the Secretary—

            (A) remaining search and rescue capabilities maintain the safety of the maritime public in the area of the station or subunit;

            (B) regional or local prevailing weather and marine conditions, including water temperature or unusual tide and current conditions, do not require continued operation of the station or subunit; and

            (C) Coast Guard search and rescue standards related to search and rescue response times are met; and

        (2) provides an opportunity for public comment and for public meetings in the area of the station or subunit with regard to the decision to close the station or subunit.

    (b) __Operational Flexibility.—__ 

    The Secretary may implement any management efficiencies within the small boat station system, such as modifying the operational posture of units or reallocating resources as necessary to ensure the safety of the maritime public nationwide. No stations or subunits may be closed under this subsection except in accordance with subsection (a).
