## § 147. Department of Commerce

    In order to promote the safety of life and property on and over the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, and to facilitate the preparation and dissemination by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the weather reports, forecasts, and warnings essential to the safe and efficient conduct of domestic and international commerce on and over such seas and waters, the Commandant may cooperate with the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by procuring, maintaining, and making available, facilities and assistance for observing, investigating, and communicating weather phenomena and for disseminating weather data, forecasts and warnings, the mutually satisfactory terms of such cooperation in weather service to be agreed upon and arranged between the Commandant and the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 507][/us/stat/63/507]; [Pub. L. 94–546, § 1(13)][/us/pl/94/546/s1/13], Oct. 18, 1976, [90 Stat. 2520][/us/stat/90/2520]; [Pub. L. 97–295, § 2(5)][/us/pl/97/295/s2/5], Oct. 12, 1982, [96 Stat. 1301][/us/stat/96/1301].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.

    Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements. Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–295][/us/pl/97/295] substituted “Administration” for “Admministration” after “Atmospheric”.

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–546][/us/pl/94/546] substituted references to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and to the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for references to the Weather Bureau and to the Chief of the Weather Bureau.
