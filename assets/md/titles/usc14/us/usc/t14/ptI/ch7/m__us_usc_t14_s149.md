L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(D)][/us/pl/98/557/s15/a/3/D], (E), (4)(A)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865]; [Pub.

L. 111–281, title II][/us/pl/111/281], §§ 206, 220, Oct. 15, 2010, [124 Stat. 2911][/us/stat/124/2911], 2918; [Pub. L. 112–213, title II][/us/pl/112/213], §§ 203, 216(d), Dec. 20, 2012, [126 Stat. 1543][/us/stat/126/1543], 1555.)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 441a ([May 19, 1926, ch. 334][/us/act/1926-05-19/ch334], [44 Stat. 565][/us/stat/44/565]; [May 14, 1935, ch. 109][/us/act/1935-05-14/ch109], [49 Stat. 218][/us/stat/49/218]; [Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571][/us/act/1942-10-01/ch571], [56 Stat. 763][/us/stat/56/763]; 1946 Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, [60 Stat. 1352][/us/stat/60/1352]).

    Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.

    It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard’s activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, [56 Stat. 763][/us/stat/56/763] (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 441–a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    2012—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 112–213, § 216(d)][/us/pl/112/213/s216/d], struck out at end “Members so detailed may accept, from the government to which detailed, offices and such compensation and emoluments thereunder appertaining as may be first approved by the Secretary. While so detailed such members shall receive, in addition to the compensation and emoluments allowed them by such governments, the pay and allowances to which they are entitled in the Coast Guard and shall be allowed the same credit for longevity, retirement, and for all other purposes that they would receive if they were serving with the Coast Guard.”

    Subsec. (d)(3). [Pub. L. 112–213, § 203][/us/pl/112/213/s203], added par. (3).

    2010—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 111–281, § 206][/us/pl/111/281/s206], added subsec. (c).

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted reference to members for reference to officers and enlisted men in three places in text, and in catchline substituted “members” for “officers and men”.

 __Delegation of Authority__ 

    Authority of President under this section as invoked by section 2 of Ex. Ord. No. 13223, Sept. 14, 2001, 66 F.R. 48201, as amended, delegated to Secretary of Homeland Security by section 5 of Ex.
