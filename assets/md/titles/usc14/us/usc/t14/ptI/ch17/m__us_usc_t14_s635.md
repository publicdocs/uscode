## § 635. Oaths required for boards

    The members of a retiring board, selection board, examining board, and any other board authorized to be assembled pursuant to this title shall be sworn to discharge their duties honestly and impartially, the oath to be administered to the members by the President or other presiding officer of the board, and to him by the junior member or recorder.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 545][/us/stat/63/545].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 170 ([Apr. 12, 1902, ch. 501][/us/act/1902-04-12/ch501], § 5, [32 Stat. 100][/us/stat/32/100]).

    Said section has been divided. That part relating to oaths is covered in this section. The remainder is covered in [section 425 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s425].

    Said section is enlarged to include the oaths required for all boards, rather than to cover retiring boards only. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
