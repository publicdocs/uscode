## § 493. Coast Guard medal

    The President may present, but not in the name of Congress, a medal to be known as the Coast Guard medal, of appropriate design, with accompanying ribbon, together with a rosette or other device to be worn in lieu thereof, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, distinguishes himself by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 535][/us/stat/63/535].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section establishes a new medal to be known as the Coast Guard Medal, which is intended to be a parallel award to the Navy and Marine Corps Medal of the Navy, to be awarded under the same circumstances as that medal is awarded to personnel of the Navy (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 356b). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
