## § 360. Recall to active duty with consent of member

    Any enlisted member on the retired list may, with his consent, be assigned to such duties as he may be able to perform, except that no enlisted member on the retired list who has reached the age of sixty-two years shall be recalled in time of peace.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 522][/us/stat/63/522]; [Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, § 19][/us/act/1950-08-03/ch536/s19], [64 Stat. 407][/us/stat/64/407]; [Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(A)][/us/pl/98/557/s15/a/3/A], (4)(B)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 185c ([May 24, 1939, ch. 146, § 4][/us/act/1939-05-24/ch146/s4], [53 Stat. 755][/us/stat/53/755]).

    This section was changed so as to make provisions for enlisted men parallel to similar provisions for commissioned and warrant officers (see §§ 241 and 311 of the revised title). It seems fair and equitable that similar provisions should apply to all classes of personnel insofar as practicable. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted “member” for “man” in section catchline, and in text substituted reference to enlisted member for reference to enlisted man in two places.

    1950—Act Aug. 3, 1950, struck out all references to pay.
