## § 292. Voluntary retirement after thirty years’ service

    Any regular commissioned officer who has completed thirty years’ service may, upon his own application, in the discretion of the Secretary, be retired from active service. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1986 Amendment note below. </sup></sup> 

(Added [Pub. L. 88–130][/us/pl/88/130], § 1(10)(C), Sept. 24, 1963, [77 Stat. 187][/us/stat/77/187]; amended [Pub. L. 99–348, title II][/us/pl/99/348/tII], § 205(b)(5), July 1, 1986, [100 Stat. 700][/us/stat/100/700].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–348][/us/pl/99/348] which directed that “, with retired pay of the grade with which retired” be struck out was executed by striking out that phrase after “from active service” as the probable intent of Congress even though there was no comma, before “with retired”.

 __Retired Pay on or Prior to__  __September 24, 1963__ 

    Savings provisions in [section 5(g) of Pub. L. 88–130][/us/pl/88/130/s5/g], providing that [Pub. L. 88–130][/us/pl/88/130] does not affect the retired pay of anyone retired on or prior to Sept. 24, 1963, are set out as a note under [section 211 of this title][/us/usc/t14/s211].
