## § 494. Insignia for additional awards

    No more than one medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or one Coast Guard medal shall be issued to any one person; but for each succeeding deed or service sufficient to justify the awarding of a medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or Coast Guard medal, the President may award a suitable emblem or insignia to be worn with the decoration and a corresponding rosette or other device.
