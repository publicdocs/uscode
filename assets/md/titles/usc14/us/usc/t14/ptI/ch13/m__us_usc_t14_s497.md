## § 497. Honorable subsequent service as condition to award

    No medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof shall be awarded or presented to any individual, or to the representative of any individual, whose entire service subsequent to the time he distinguished himself shall not in the opinion of the Commandant have been honorable.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 536][/us/stat/63/536]; [Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, § 13][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041/s13], [70A Stat. 624][/us/stat/70A/624]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section makes honorable service subsequent to the act for which award is made, a condition precedent to granting the award. The Navy has the same statutory condition (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 362). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—[Pub. L. 111–281][/us/pl/111/281] substituted “Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross,” for “distinguished service medal, distinguished flying cross,”.

    1956—Act Aug. 10, 1956, included the distinguished flying cross.
