## § 488. Advancement of public funds to personnel

    The Commandant, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may advance public funds to personnel when required to meet expenses of members detailed on emergency shore duty. Funds so advanced shall not exceed a reasonable estimate of the actual expenditures to be made and for which reimbursement is authorized by law.

([Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393][/us/act/1949-08-04/ch393], [63 Stat. 534][/us/stat/63/534]; [Pub. L. 98–557, § 15(a)(3)(I)][/us/pl/98/557/s15/a/3/I], Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2865][/us/stat/98/2865].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 885, and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 3a ([May 22, 1928, ch. 688][/us/act/1928-05-22/ch688], [45 Stat. 712][/us/stat/45/712]; [Oct. 26, 1942, ch. 623][/us/act/1942-10-26/ch623], [56 Stat. 987][/us/stat/56/987]).

    Said section 885 was made applicable to the Coast Guard by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 3a whenever the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy. Experience has shown the advantage of having such a provision applicable to the Coast Guard at all times.

    Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–557][/us/pl/98/557] substituted reference to members for reference to officers and men.
