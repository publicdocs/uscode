## § 1703. Insurance of financial institutions

    (a) __Authority to insure financial institutions__ 

    The Secretary is authorized and empowered upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure banks, trust companies, personal finance companies, mortgage companies, building and loan associations, installment lending companies and other such financial institutions, which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities and approves as eligible for credit insurance, against losses which they may sustain as a result of loans and advances of credit, and purchases of obligations representing loans and advances of credit, made by them for the purpose of (i) financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures or manufactured homes, and the building of new structures, upon urban, suburban, or rural real property (including the restoration, rehabilitation, rebuilding, and replacement of such improvements which have been damaged or destroyed by earthquake, conflagration, tornado, hurricane, cyclone, flood, or other catastrophe), by the owners thereof or by lessees of such real property under a lease expiring not less than six months after the maturity of the loan or advance of credit; and for the purpose of (ii) financing the purchase of a manufactured home to be used by the owner as his principal residence or financing the purchase of a lot on which to place such home and paying expenses reasonably necessary for the appropriate preparation of such lot, including the installation of utility connections, sanitary facilities, and paving, and the construction of a suitable pad, or financing only the acquisition of such a lot either with or without such preparation by an owner of a manufactured home; and for the purpose of financing the preservation of historic structures, and, as used in this section, the term “historic structures” means residential structures which are registered in the National Register of Historic Places or which are certified by the Secretary of the Interior to conform to National Register criteria; and the term “preservation” means restoration or rehabilitation undertaken for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary in regulations issued by him, after consulting with the Secretary of the Interior. Other than in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place such a home (or both), in no case shall the insurance granted by the Secretary under this section to any such financial institution on loans, advances of credit, and purchases made by such financial institution for such purposes exceed 10 per centum of the total amount of such loans, advances of credit, and purchases. With respect to any loan, advance of credit, or purchase, the amount of any claim for loss on any such individual loan, advance of credit or purchase paid by the Secretary under the provisions of this section to a lending institution shall not exceed 90 per centum of such loss.

        After August 2, 1954, (i) the Secretary shall not enter into contracts for insurance pursuant to this section except with lending institutions which are subject to the inspection and supervision of a governmental agency required by law to make periodic examinations of their books and accounts, and which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases, and with such other lending institutions which the Secretary approves as eligible for insurance pursuant to this section on the basis of their credit and their experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases; (ii) only such items as substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of properties shall be eligible for financing under this section, and therefore the Secretary shall from time to time declare ineligible for financing under this section any item, product, alteration, repair, improvement, or class thereof which he determines would not substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of such properties, and he may also declare ineligible for financing under this section any item which he determines is especially subject to selling abuses; and (iii) the Secretary is authorized and directed, by such regulations or procedures as he shall deem advisable, to prevent the use of any financial assistance under this section (1) with respect to new residential structures (other than manufactured homes) that have not been completed and occupied for at least six months, or (2) which would, through multiple loans, result in an outstanding aggregate loan balance with respect to the same structure exceeding the dollar amount limitation prescribed in this subsection for the type of loan involved: Provided, That this clause (iii) may in the discretion of the Secretary be waived with respect to the period of occupancy or completion of any such new residential structures. The Secretary is hereby authorized and directed, with respect to manufactured homes to be financed under this section, to (i) prescribe minimum property standards to assure the livability and durability of the manufactured home and the suitability of the site on which the manufactured home is to be located; and (ii) obtain assurances from the borrower that the manufactured home will be placed on a site which complies with the standards prescribed by the Secretary and with local zoning and other applicable local requirements.

        The insurance authority provided under this section may be made available with respect to any existing manufactured home that has not been insured under this section if such home was constructed in accordance with the standards issued under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 \[[42 U.S.C. 5401][/us/usc/t42/s5401] et seq.\] and it meets standards similar to the minimum property standards applicable to existing homes insured under subchapter II of this chapter.

        Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may include the provision of fire safety equipment, energy conserving improvements, or the installation of solar energy systems. Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may also include the evaluation and reduction of lead-based paint hazards. As used in this section—

        (1) the term “fire safety equipment” means any device or facility which is designed to reduce the risk of personal injury or property damage resulting from fire and is in conformity with such criteria and standards as shall be prescribed by the Secretary;

        (2) the term “energy conserving improvements” means the purchase and installation of weatherization materials as defined in [section 6862(9) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s6862/9]; and  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The word “and” probably should not appear. </sup></sup> 

        (3) the term “solar energy system” means any addition, alteration, or improvement to an existing or new structure which is designed to utilize wind energy or solar energy either of the active type based on mechanically forced energy transfer or of the passive type based on convective, conductive, or radiant energy transfer or some combination of these types to reduce the energy requirements of that structure from other energy sources, and which is in conformity with such criteria and standards as shall be prescribed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. The period probably should be “; and”. </sup></sup> 

        (4) the terms “evaluation”, “reduction”, and “lead-based paint hazard” have the same meanings given those terms in [section 4851b of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s4851b].

    (b) __Conditions for denial of insurance__ 

        (1)

         Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, no insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it if the amount of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase exceeds—

            (A)

                (i) $25,000 if made for the purpose of financing alterations, repairs and improvements upon or in connection with existing single-family structures; and

                (ii) $25,090 if made for the purpose of financing alterations, repairs and improvements upon or in connection with existing manufactured homes;

            (B) $60,000 or an average amount of $12,000 per family unit if made for the purpose of financing the alteration, repair, improvement, or conversion of an existing structure used or to be used as an apartment house or a dwelling for two or more families;

            (C) $69,678 if made for the purpose of financing the purchase of a manufactured home;

            (D) $92,904 if made for the purpose of financing the purchase of a manufactured home and a suitably developed lot on which to place the home; and 1

            (E) $23,226 if made for the purpose of financing the purchase, by an owner of a manufactured home which is the principal residence of that owner, of a suitably developed lot on which to place that manufactured home, and if the owner certifies that he or she will place the manufactured home on the lot acquired with such loan within 6 months after the date of such loan. <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

            (F) $15,000 per family unit if made for the purpose of financing the preservation of an historic structure; and

            (G) such principal amount as the Secretary may prescribe if made for the purpose of financing fire safety equipment for a nursing home, extended health care facility, intermediate health care facility, or other comparable health care facility.

            The Secretary shall, by regulation, annually increase the dollar amount limitations in subparagraphs (A)(ii), (C), (D), and (E) (as such limitations may have been previously adjusted under this sentence) in accordance with the index established pursuant to paragraph (9).

        (2) Because of prevailing higher costs, the Secretary may, by regulation, in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii, increase any dollar amount limitation on manufactured homes or manufactured home lot loans contained in this subsection by not to exceed 40 per centum. In other areas, the maximum dollar amounts specified in subsections (b)(1)(D) and (b)(1)(E) of this section may be increased on an area-by-area basis to the extent the Secretary deems necessary, but in no case may such limits, as so increased, exceed the lesser of (A) 185 percent of the dollar amount specified, or (B) the dollar amount specified as increased by the same percentage by which 95 percent of the median one-family house price in the area (as determined by the Secretary) exceeds $67,500.

        (3)

         No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it if the term to maturity of such loan, advance of credit or purchase exceeds—

            (A)

                (i) twenty years and thirty-two days if made for the purpose of financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with an existing single-family structure; and

                (ii) fifteen years and thirty-two days if made for the purpose of financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with an existing manufactured home;

            (B) twenty years and thirty-two days if made for the purpose of financing the alteration, repair, improvement or conversion of an existing structure used or to be used as an apartment house or a dwelling for two or more families;

            (C) twenty years and thirty-two days (twenty-three years and thirty-two days in the case of a manufactured home composed of two or more modules) if made for the purpose of financing the purchase of a manufactured home;

            (D) twenty years and thirty-two days (twenty-five years and thirty-two days in the case of a manufactured home composed of two or more modules) if made for the purpose of financing the purchase of a manufactured home and a suitably developed lot on which to place the home;

            (E) twenty years and thirty-two days if made for the purpose of financing the purchase, by the owner of a manufactured home which is the principal residence of that owner, of a suitably developed lot on which to place that manufactured home;

            (F) fifteen years and thirty-two days if made for the purpose of financing the preservation of an historic structure;

            (G) such term to maturity as the Secretary may prescribe if made for the purpose of financing the construction of a new structure for use in whole or in part for agricultural purposes; and

            (H) such term to maturity as the Secretary may prescribe if made for the purpose of financing fire safety equipment for a nursing home, extended health care facility, intermediate health care facility, or other comparable health care facility.

        (4)

         For the purpose of this subsection—

            (A) the term “developed lot” includes an interest in a condominium project (including any interest in the common areas) or a share in a cooperative association;

            (B) a loan to finance the purchase of a manufactured home or a manufactured home and lot may also finance the purchase of a garage, patio, carport, or other comparable appurtenance; and

            (C) a loan to finance the purchase of a manufactured home or a manufactured home and lot shall be secured by a first lien upon such home or home and lot, its furnishings, equipment, accessories, and appurtenances.

        (5) No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it unless the obligation has such maturity, bears such insurance premium charges, and contains such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary shall prescribe, in order to make credit available for the purpose of this subchapter. Any such obligation with respect to which insurance is granted under this section shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the financial institution.

        (6)

            (A) Any obligation with respect to which insurance is granted under this section may be refinanced and extended in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, but in no event for an additional amount or term in excess of any applicable maximum provided for in this subsection.

            (B) The owner of a manufactured home lot purchased without assistance under this section but otherwise meeting the requirements of this section may refinance such lot under this section in connection with the purchase of a manufactured home if the borrower certifies that the home and lot is or will be his or her principal residence within six months after the date of the loan.

            (C) The owner-occupant of a manufactured home or a home and lot which was purchased without assistance under this section but which otherwise meets the requirements of this section may refinance such home or home and lot under this section if the home was constructed in accordance with standards established under section 604 of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 \[[42 U.S.C. 5403][/us/usc/t42/s5403]\].

        (7) With respect to the financing of alterations, repairs, and improvements to existing structures or the building of new structures as authorized under clause (i) of the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section, any loan broker (as defined by the Secretary) or any other party having a financial interest in the making of such a loan or advance of credit or in providing assistance to the borrower in preparing the loan application or otherwise assisting the borrower in obtaining the loan or advance of credit who knowingly (as defined in [section 1735f–14(g) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1735f–14/g]) submits to any such financial institution or to the Secretary false information shall be subject to a civil money penalty in the amount and manner provided under [section 1735f–14 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1735f–14] with respect to mortgagees and lenders under this chapter.

        (8) __Insurance benefits for manufactured housing loans.—__ 

        Any contract of insurance with respect to loans, advances of credit, or purchases in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place a manufactured home (or both) for a financial institution that is executed under this subchapter after July 30, 2008, by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of such financial institution for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of the bearer from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such institution.

        (9) __Annual indexing of manufactured housing loans.—__ 

        The Secretary shall develop a method of indexing in order to annually adjust the loan limits established in subparagraphs (A)(ii), (C), (D), and (E) of this subsection. Such index shall be based on the manufactured housing price data collected by the United States Census Bureau. The Secretary shall establish such index no later than 1 year after July 30, 2008.

        (10) __Financial soundness of manufactured housing program.—__ 

        The Secretary shall establish such underwriting criteria for loans and advances of credit in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place a manufactured home (or both), including such loans and advances represented by obligations purchased by financial institutions, as may be necessary to ensure that the program under this subchapter for insurance for financial institutions against losses from such loans, advances of credit, and purchases is financially sound.

        (11) __Leasehold requirements.—__ 

        No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it, made for the purposes of financing a manufactured home which is intended to be situated in a manufactured home community pursuant to a lease, unless such lease—

            (A) expires not less than 3 years after the origination date of the obligation;

            (B) is renewable upon the expiration of the original 3 year term by successive 1 year terms; and

            (C) requires the lessor to provide the lessee written notice of termination of the lease not less than 180 days prior to the expiration of the current lease term in the event the lessee is required to move due to the closing of the manufactured home community, and further provides that failure to provide such notice to the mortgagor in a timely manner will cause the lease term, at its expiration, to automatically renew for an additional 1 year term.

    (c) __Handling and disposal of property__ 

        (1) __Authority of Secretary__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may—

            (A) deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, or assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, for cash or credit in the Secretary’s discretion, and upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Secretary shall determine to be reasonable, any real or personal property conveyed to or otherwise acquired by the Secretary, in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this subchapter, including any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this section; and

            (B) pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims assigned to or held by the Secretary and all legal or equitable rights accruing to the Secretary in connection with the payment of such insurance, including unpaid insurance premiums owed in connection with insurance made available by this subchapter.

        (2) __Advertisements for proposals__ 

            [Section 6101 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s6101] shall not be construed to apply to any contract of hazard insurance or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $25,000.

        (3) __Delegation of authority__ 

            The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary, deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter may be exercised by an officer appointed by the Secretary without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in the Secretary’s discretion, to any officer or agent the Secretary may appoint.

    (d) __Authority to transfer insurance__ 

        The Secretary is authorized and empowered, under such regulations as he may prescribe, to transfer to any such approved financial institution any insurance in connection with any loans and advances of credit which may be sold to it by another approved financial institution.

    (e) __Authority to waive compliance with regulations__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to waive compliance with regulations heretofore or hereafter prescribed by him with respect to the interest and maturity of and the terms, conditions, and restrictions under which loans, advances of credit, and purchases may be insured under this section and section 1706a  <sup>\[4\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 4 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, if in his judgment the enforcement of such regulations would impose an injustice upon an insured institution which has substantially complied with such regulations in good faith and refunded or credited any excess charge made, and where such waiver does not involve an increase of the obligation of the Secretary beyond the obligation which would have been involved if the regulations had been fully complied with.

    (f) __Premium charges; manufactured home loans__ 

        (1) __Premium charges__ 

            The Secretary shall fix a premium charge for the insurance hereafter granted under this section, but in the case of any obligation representing any loan, advance of credit, or purchase, such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the net proceeds of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase, for the term of such obligation, and such premium charge shall be payable in advance by the financial institution and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.

        (2) __Manufactured home loans__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the case of a loan, advance of credit, or purchase in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place such a home (or both), the premium charge for the insurance granted under this section shall be paid by the borrower under the loan or advance of credit, as follows:

            (A) At the time of the making of the loan, advance of credit, or purchase, a single premium payment in an amount not to exceed 2.25 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation.

            (B) In addition to the premium under subparagraph (A), annual premium payments during the term of the loan, advance, or obligation purchased in an amount not exceeding 1.0 percent of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments).

            (C) Premium charges under this paragraph shall be established in amounts that are sufficient, but do not exceed the minimum amounts necessary, to maintain a negative credit subsidy for the program under this section for insurance of loans, advances of credit, or purchases in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place such a home (or both), as determined based upon risk to the Federal Government under existing underwriting requirements.

            (D) The Secretary may increase the limitations on premium payments to percentages above those set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), but only if necessary, and not in excess of the minimum increase necessary, to maintain a negative credit subsidy as described in subparagraph (C).

    (g) __Finality of payment for loss__ 

        Any payment for loss made to an approved financial institution under this section shall be final and incontestable after two years from the date the claim was certified for payment by the Secretary, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such institution, unless a demand for repurchase of the obligation shall have been made on behalf of the United States prior to the expiration of such two-year period.

    (h) __Authority to regulate__ 

        The Secretary is authorized and directed to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.

    (i) __“Manufactured home” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “manufactured home” includes any elder cottage housing opportunity unit that is small, freestanding, barrier-free, energy efficient, removable, and designed to be installed adjacent to an existing 1- to 4-family dwelling.
