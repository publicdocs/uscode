## § 1715z–6. Supplemental loans for multifamily projects

    (a) __Authorization to insure; “supplemental loan” defined__ 

        With respect to a multifamily project, hospital, or group practice facility covered by a mortgage insured under any section or subchapter of this chapter or covered by a mortgage held by the Secretary, the Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to make commitments to insure, and to insure, supplemental loans (including advances during construction or improvement) made by financial institutions approved by the Secretary. As used in this section, “supplemental loan” means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made for the purpose of financing improvements or additions to such proj­ect, hospital, or facility: Provided, That a loan involving a nursing home, hospital, or a group practice facility may also be made for the purpose of financing equipment to be used in the operation of such nursing home, hospital, or facility.

    (b) __Eligibility for insurance__ 

    To be eligible for insurance under this section, a supplemental loan shall—

        (1) be limited to 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of such improvements, additions, and equipment, except that such amount when added to the outstanding balance of the mortgage covering the project or facility, shall not exceed the maximum mortgage amount insurable under the section or subchapter pursuant to which the mortgage covering such project or facility is insured or an amount acceptable to the Secretary;

        (2) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary;

        (3) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the financial institution;

        (4) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;

        (5) be governed by the labor standards provisions of [section 1715c of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715c] that are applicable to the section or subchapter pursuant to which the mortgage covering the proj­ect or facility is insured or pursuant to which the original mortgage covering the project or facility was insured; and

        (6) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe.

    (c) __Applicability of other provisions of law__ 

        The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), and (n) of [section 1713 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1713] shall be applicable to loans insured under this section, except that (1) all references to the term “mortgage” shall be construed to refer to the term “loan” as used in this section, (2) loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under [section 1715e of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715e] that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be insured under and shall be the obligation of such fund, and (3) loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under [section 1715z–1 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715z–1] shall be insured under and shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.

    (d) __Authorization to insure loans for improvements or additions; terms and conditions; limitation on amount__ 

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary may insure a loan for improvements or additions to a multifamily housing project, or a group practice or medical practice facility or hospital or other health facility approved by the Secretary, which is not covered by a mortgage insured under this chapter, if he finds that such a loan would assist in preserving, expanding, or improving housing opportunities, or in providing protection against fire or other hazards. Such loans shall have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary and shall meet such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. In no event shall such a loan be insured if it is for an amount in excess of the maximum amount which could be approved if the outstanding indebtedness, if any, covering the property were a mortgage insured under this chapter. At any sale under foreclosure of a mortgage on a project or facility which is not insured under this chapter but which is senior to a loan assigned to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to bid, in addition to amounts authorized under [section 1713(k) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1713/k], any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by such senior mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses. In the event that, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary acquires title to, or is assigned, a loan covering a project or facility which is subject to a mortgage which is not insured under this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to make payments from the General Insurance Fund on the debt secured by such mortgage, and to take such other steps as the Secretary may deem appropriate to preserve or protect the Secretary’s interest in the project or facility.

    (e) __Loan insurance for energy conserving improvements and solar energy systems__ 

        (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may insure a loan for purchasing and installing energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of [section 1703(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1703/a]), for purchasing and installing a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of [section 1703(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1703/a]), and for purchasing or installing (or both) individual utility meters in a multifamily housing project if such meters are purchased or installed in connection with other energy conserving improvements or with a solar energy system or the project meets minimum standards of energy conservation established by the Secretary, without regard to whether the proj­ect is covered by a mortgage under this chapter.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, a loan insured under this subsection shall—

            (A) not exceed an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary for the purchase and installation of individual utility meters plus an amount which the Secretary deems appropriate taking into account amounts which will be saved in operation costs over the period of repayment of the loan by reducing the energy requirements of the project as a result of the installation of energy conserving improvements or a solar energy system therein;

            (B) be insured for 90 percent of any loss incurred by the person holding the note for the loan; except that, for cooperative multifamily projects receiving assistance under [section 1715z–1 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715z–1] or financed with a below market interest rate mortgage insured under section 1715l(d)(3) of this title, 100 percent of any such loss may be insured;

            (C) bear an interest rate not to exceed an amount which the Secretary determines, after consulting with the Secretary of Energy, to be necessary to meet market demands;

            (D) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary;

            (E) be insured pursuant to a premium rate established on a sound actuarial basis to the extent practicable;

            (F) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;

            (G) be an acceptable risk in that energy conservation or solar energy benefits to be derived outweigh the risks of possible loss to the Federal Government; and

            (H) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe.

        (3) The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply to loans insured under this subsection.

        (4) The Secretary shall provide that any person obligated on the note for any loan insured under this section be regulated or restricted, until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance, by the Secretary as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operations of the multifamily project to such an extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment.

    (f) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 104–204, title II__  __][/us/pl/104/204]__  __,__  __Sept. 26, 1996__  __,__  __[__  __110 Stat. 2885__  __][/us/stat/110/2885]__ 

    (g) __Extension of rental assistance for term of loan__ 

        (1)

         When underwriting a rehabilitation loan under this section in connection with eligible multifamily housing, the Secretary may assume that any rental assistance provided for purposes of servicing the additional debt will be extended for the term of the rehabilitation loan. The Secretary shall exercise prudent underwriting practices in insuring rehabilitation loans under this section. For purposes of this subsection, the term “eligible multifamily housing” means any housing financed by a loan or mortgage that is—

            (A) insured or held by the Secretary under section 1715l(d)(3) of this title and assisted under [section 1701s of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1701s] or [section 1437f of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1437f];

            (B) insured or held by the Secretary and bears interest at a rate determined under the proviso of section 1715l(d)(5) of this title; or

            (C) insured, assisted or held by the Secretary under [section 1715z–1 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715z–1].

        (2) A mortgagee approved by the Secretary may not withhold consent to a rehabilitation loan insured in connection with eligible multifamily housing on which that mortgagee holds a mortgage.
