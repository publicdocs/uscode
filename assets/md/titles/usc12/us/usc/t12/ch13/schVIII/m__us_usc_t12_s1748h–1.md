## § 1748h–1. Civilian employees of Armed Forces

    (a) __Requirements; certificate of need for housing and employment status__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter and in addition to mortgages insured under [section 1748b of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1748b], the Secretary may insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements set forth in [section 1709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709/b]: Provided, That a mortgage insured under this section shall have been executed by a mortgagor who at the time of insurance is the owner of the property and either occupies the property or certifies that his failure to do so is the result of a change in his employment by the Armed Forces or a contractor thereof and to whom the Secretary of Defense or his designee has issued a certificate indicating that such person requires housing and is at the date of the certificate a civilian employee at a research or development installation of one of the military departments of the United States or a contractor thereof and is considered by such military department to be an essential, nontemporary employee at such date. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the employment status of the mortgagor and of the mortgagor’s need for housing.

    (b) __Certification of housing need to Secretary; guaranty from loss; authorization of appropriations__ 

        No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified to the Secretary that the housing is necessary to provide adequate housing for such civilians employed in connection with such a research or development installation and that there is no present intention to substantially curtail the number of such civilian personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: Provided, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a) of this section, if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.

    (c) __Economic soundness of property__ 

        The Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter, that the project or property be economically sound or an acceptable risk.

    (d) __Insurance benefits to which mortgagee entitled__ 

        Any mortgagee under a mortgage insured under this section is entitled to the benefits of insurance as provided in [section 1710(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/a] with respect to mortgages insured under [section 1709 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709].

    (e) __Payment of insurance; meaning of terms__ 

        The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  (j), and (k)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of [section 1710 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710] shall apply to mortgages insured under this section except that as applicable to those mortgages: (1) all references to the “Fund” or “Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund” shall refer to the “General Insurance Fund” and (2) all references to [section 1709 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709] shall refer to this section.

    (f) __Provisions of subchapter applicable; termination date__ 

        The provisions of sections 1748, 1748a,1 1748b(c), 1748b(i), 1748b(j), 1748c(a),1 1748c(b),1 and 1748f of this title and the provisions of [section 1748b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1748b/a] relating to the aggregate amount of all mortgages insured under this subchapter, shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.

    (g) __Housing for persons employed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration or Atomic Energy Commission; guaranty from loss; definitions__ 

        (1) A mortgage secured by property which is intended to provide housing for a person (i) employed or assigned to duty at or in connection with any research or development installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and which is located at or near such installation, or (ii) employed at any research or development installation of the Atomic Energy Commission and which is located at or near such installation, may (if the mortgage otherwise meets the requirements of this section) be insured by the Secretary under the provisions of this section. The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (or his designee), in the case of any mortgage secured by property intended to provide housing for any person employed or assigned to duty at any such installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (or his designee), in the case of any mortgage secured by property intended to provide housing for any person employed at such installation of the Atomic Energy Commission, is authorized to guarantee and indemnify the General Insurance Fund against loss to the extent required by the Secretary, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.
