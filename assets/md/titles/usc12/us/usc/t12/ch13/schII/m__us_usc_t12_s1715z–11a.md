A grant provided under this subsection during fiscal years 2006 through 2010 shall be available only to the extent that appropriations are made in advance for such purposes and shall not be derived from the General Insurance Fund.

    (b) __Transfer of unoccupied and substandard housing to local governments and community development corporations__ 

        (1) __Transfer authority__ 

            Notwithstanding the authority under subsection (a) and the last sentence of [section 1710(g) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/g], the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall transfer ownership of any qualified HUD property, subject to the requirements of this section, to a unit of general local government having jurisdiction for the area in which the property is located or to a community development corporation which operates within such a unit of general local government in accordance with this subsection, but only to the extent that units of general local government and community development corporations consent to transfer and the Secretary determines that such transfer is practicable.

        (2) __Qualified HUD properties__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “qualified HUD property” means any property for which, as of the date that notification of the property is first made under paragraph (3)(B), not less than 6 months have elapsed since the later of the date that the property was acquired by the Secretary or the date that the property was determined to be unoccupied or substandard, that is owned by the Secretary and is—

            (A) an unoccupied multifamily housing project;

            (B) a substandard multifamily housing project; or

            (C)

             an unoccupied single family property that—

                (i) has been determined by the Secretary not to be an eligible asset under [section 1710(h) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/h]; or

                (ii)

                 is an eligible asset under such [section 1710(h) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/h], but—

                    (I) is not subject to a specific sale agreement under such section; and

                    (II) has been determined by the Secretary to be inappropriate for continued inclusion in the program under such [section 1710(h) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/h] pursuant to paragraph (10) of such section.

            (C) such units and corporations to express interest in the transfer under this subsection of such properties;

            (D)

             a right of first refusal for transfer of qualified HUD properties to units of general local government and community development corporations, under which—

                (i) the Secretary shall establish a period during which the Secretary may not transfer such properties except to such units and corporations;

                (ii) the Secretary shall offer qualified HUD properties that are single family properties for purchase by units of general local government at a cost of $1 for each property, but only to the extent that the costs to the Federal Government of disposal at such price do not exceed the costs to the Federal Government of disposing of property subject to the procedures for single family property established by the Secretary pursuant to the authority under the last sentence of [section 1710(g) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1710/g];

                (iii) the Secretary may accept an offer to purchase a property made by a community development corporation only if the offer provides for purchase on a cost recovery basis; and

                (iv) the Secretary shall accept an offer to purchase such a property that is made during such period by such a unit or corporation and that complies with the requirements of this paragraph; and

            (E) a written explanation, to any unit of general local government or community development corporation making an offer to purchase a qualified HUD property under this subsection that is not accepted, of the reason that such offer was not acceptable.

        (4) __Other disposition__ 

            With respect to any qualified HUD property, if the Secretary does not receive an acceptable offer to purchase the property pursuant to the procedure established under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall dispose of the property to the unit of general local government in which property is located or to community development corporations located in such unit of general local government on a negotiated, competitive bid, or other basis, on such terms as the Secretary deems appropriate.
