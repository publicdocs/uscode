    (a) __Acquisition of project by Secretary; issuance of debentures__ 

        If the aggregate of the amounts paid to the investor pursuant to [section 1747f of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1747f] with respect to a project insured under this subchapter shall at any time equal or exceed 15 per centum of the established investment, the Secretary thereafter shall have the right, after written notice to the investor of his intentions so to do, to acquire, as of the first day of any operating year, such project in consideration of the issuance and delivery to the investor of debentures having a total face value equal to 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for such operating year. In any such case the investor shall be obligated to convey to said Secretary title to the project which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the insurance contract was executed and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and, in the event that the investor fails so to do, said Secretary may, at his option, terminate the insurance contract.

    (b) __Relinquishment of project by investor__ 

        If in any operating year the aggregate of the differences between the operating expenses (exclusive of any premium charges previously waived hereunder) and the gross income for the preceding operating years, less the aggregate of any deficits in such operating expenses reimbursed from excess earnings as hereinbefore provided, shall at any time equal or exceed 5 per centum of the established investment, the investor shall thereafter have the right, after written notice to the Secretary of his intention so to do, to convey to the Secretary, as of the first day of any operating year, title to the proj­ect which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the insurance contract was executed and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and to receive from the Secretary debentures having a total face value equal to 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for such operating year.

    (c) __Adjustment of difference between outstanding investment and total face value of debentures__ 

        Any difference, not exceeding $50, between 90 per centum of the outstanding investment for the operating year in which a project is acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this section and the total face value of the debentures to be issued and delivered to the investment pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the investor from the General Insurance Fund.

    (d) __Termination of insurance contract by Secretary__ 

        Upon the acquisition of a project by the Secretary pursuant to this section, the insurance contract shall terminate.

    (e) __Issuance and execution of debentures__ 

        Debentures issued under this subchapter to any investor shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. Such debentures shall be dated as of the first day of the operating year in which the project for which such debentures were issued was acquired by the Secretary, shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the insurance contract was executed, but not to exceed 2¾ per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature on the 1st day of July in such calendar year or years, not later than the fortieth following the date of the issuance thereof, as shall be determined by the Secretary and stated on the face of such debentures.

    (f) __Terms and conditions of debentures__ 

        Such debentures shall be in such form and in such denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and may include such provisions of redemption as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be issued in either coupon or registered form.

    (g) __Exemption from taxation; exceptions; guaranty__ 

        Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, shall be payable out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, as to both the principal thereof and the interest thereon, by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face thereof. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or the interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof, which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.

    (h) __Payment of expenses and charges; collection of claims__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provisions of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real and other property by the United States, the Secretary shall have power, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, to pay out of said Fund all expenses or charges in connection with, and to deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit or lease in his discretion, in whole or in part, any project acquired pursuant to this subchapter; and, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection by way of compromise or otherwise all claims acquired by, or assigned or transferred to, him in connection with the acquisition or disposal of any project pursuant to this subchapter: Provided, That [section 6101 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s6101] shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of any project acquired pursuant to this subchapter if the amount of such purchase or contract does not exceed $1,000.
