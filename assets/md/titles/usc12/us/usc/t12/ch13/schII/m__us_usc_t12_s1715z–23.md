        (5) to enhance the administrative capacity of the FHA to carry out its expanded role under the HOPE for Homeowners Program;

            (A) establish requirements and standards for the program consistent with [section 1709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709/b] to the maximum extent possible; and

            (B) prescribe such regulations and provide such guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to implement such requirements and standards.

        (2) __Duties of the Secretary__ 

            In carrying out any of the program requirements or standards established under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue such interim guidance and mortgagee letters as the Secretary determines necessary or appropriate.

        (3) __Duties of Board__ 

            The Board shall advise the Secretary regarding the establishment and implementation of the HOPE for Homeowners Program.

    (d) __Insurance of mortgages__ 

        The Secretary is authorized upon application of a mortgagee to make commitments to insure or to insure any eligible mortgage that has been refinanced in a manner meeting the requirements under subsection (e).

    (e) __Requirements of insured mortgages__ 

    To be eligible for insurance under this section, a refinanced eligible mortgage shall comply with all of the following requirements:

        (1) __Borrower certification__ 

            (A) __No intentional default or false information__ 

                The mortgagor shall provide a certification to the Secretary that the mortgagor has not intentionally defaulted on the existing mortgage or mortgages or any other substantial debt within the last 5 years and has not knowingly, or willfully and with actual knowledge, furnished material information known to be false for the purpose of obtaining the eligible mortgage to be insured and has not been convicted under Federal or State law for fraud during the 10-year period ending upon the insurance of the mortgage under this section.

            (B) __Liability for repayment__ 

                The mortgagor shall agree in writing that the mortgagor shall be liable to repay to the Secretary any direct financial benefit achieved from the reduction of indebtedness on the existing mortgage or mortgages on the residence refinanced under this section derived from misrepresentations made by the mortgagor in the certifications and documentation required under this paragraph, subject to the discretion of the Secretary.

            (C) __Current borrower debt-to-income ratio__ 

                As of the date of application for a commitment to insure or insurance under this section, the mortgagor shall have had, or thereafter is likely to have, due to the terms of the mortgage being reset, a ratio of mortgage debt to income, taking into consideration all existing mortgages of that mortgagor at such time, greater than 31 percent (or such higher amount as the Secretary determines appropriate).

        (2) __Determination of principal obligation amount__ 

        The principal obligation amount of the refinanced eligible mortgage to be insured shall—

            (A) be determined by the reasonable ability of the mortgagor to make his or her mortgage payments, as such ability is determined by the Secretary pursuant to [section 1709(b)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709/b/4] or by any other underwriting standards established by the Secretary; and

            (B) not exceed 90 percent of the appraised value of the property to which such mortgage relates (or such higher percentage as the Secretary determines, in the discretion of the Secretary).

The Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to facilitate coordination and agreement between the holders of the existing senior mortgage and any existing subordinate mortgages, taking into consideration the subordinate lien status of such subordinate mortgages. Such actions may include making payments, which shall be accepted as payment in full of all indebtedness under the eligible mortgage, to any holder of an existing subordinate mortgage, in lieu of any future appreciation payments authorized under subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Shared appreciation__ 

                (i) __In general__

                (ii) __Factors__ 

                In establishing the standards and policies required under clause (i), the Secretary shall take into consideration—

                    (I) the status of any subordinate mortgage;

                    (II) the outstanding principal balance of and accrued interest on the existing senior mortgage and any outstanding subordinate mortgages;

                    (III) the extent to which the current appraised value of the property securing a subordinate mortgage is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on any other liens that are senior to such subordinate mortgage; and

                    (IV) such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

            (C) __Voluntary program__ 

                This paragraph may not be construed to require any holder of any existing mortgage to participate in the program under this section generally, or with respect to any particular loan.

        (9) __Documentation and verification of income__ 

            In complying with the FHA underwriting requirements under the HOPE for Homeowners Program under this section, the mortgagee shall document and verify the income of the mortgagor or non-filing status in accordance with procedures and standards that the Secretary shall establish (provided that such procedures and standards are consistent with [section 1709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1709/b] to the maximum extent possible) which may include requiring the mortgagee to procure a copy of the income tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, for the two most recent years for which the filing deadline for such years has passed.
