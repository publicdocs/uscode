    (2) failing to make payments under the mortgage or deed of trust as the payments become due, regardless of whether the purchaser is obligated on the loan, and

    (3) applying or authorizing the application of rents from such dwellings for his own use,

    shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.
