## § 4806. Regulatory appeals process, ombudsman, and alternative dispute resolution

    (a) __In general__ 

        Not later than 180 days after September 23, 1994, each appropriate Federal banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board shall establish an independent intra-agency appellate process. The process shall be available to review material supervisory determinations made at insured depository institutions or at insured credit unions that the agency supervises.

    (b) __Review process__ 

    In establishing the independent appellate process under subsection (a) of this section, each agency shall ensure that—

        (1) any appeal of a material supervisory determination by an insured depository institution or insured credit union is heard and decided expeditiously; and

        (2) appropriate safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners.

    (c) __Comment period__ 

        Not later than 90 days after September 23, 1994, each appropriate Federal banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board shall provide public notice and opportunity for comment on proposed guidelines for the establishment of an appellate process under this section.

    (d) __Agency ombudsman__

        (2) __Duties of ombudsman__ 

        The ombudsman appointed in accordance with paragraph (1) for any agency shall—

            (A) act as a liaison between the agency and any affected person with respect to any problem such party may have in dealing with the agency resulting from the regulatory activities of the agency; and

            (B) assure that safeguards exist to encourage complainants to come forward and preserve confidentiality.

    (e) __Alternative dispute resolution pilot program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 18 months after September 23, 1994, each Federal banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board shall develop and implement a pilot program for using alternative means of dispute resolution of issues in controversy (hereafter in this section referred to as the “alternative dispute resolution program”) that is consistent with the requirements of subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5 if the parties to the dispute, including the agency, agree to such proceeding.

        (2) __Standards__ 

        An alternative dispute resolution pilot program developed under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) be fair to all interested parties to a dispute;

            (B) resolve disputes expeditiously; and

            (C) be less costly than traditional means of dispute resolution, including litigation.

        (3) __Independent evaluation__ 

        Not later than 18 months after the date on which a pilot program is implemented under paragraph (1), the Administrative Conference of the United States shall submit to the Congress a report containing—

            (A) an evaluation of that pilot program;

            (B) the extent to which the pilot programs meet the standards established under paragraph (2);

            (C) the extent to which parties to disputes were offered alternative means of dispute resolution and the frequency with which the parties, including the agencies, accepted or declined to use such means; and

            (D) any recommendations of the Conference to improve the alternative dispute resolution procedures of the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration Board.

        (4) __Implementation of program__ 

            At any time after completion of the evaluation under paragraph (3)(A), any Federal banking agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board may implement an alternative dispute resolution program throughout the agency, taking into account the results of that evaluation.

        (5) __Coordination with existing agency ADR programs__ 

            (A) __Evaluation required__ 

                If any Federal banking agency or the National Credit Union Administration maintains an alternative dispute resolution program as of September 23, 1994, under any other provision of law, the Administrative Conference of the United States shall include such program in the evaluation conducted under paragraph (3)(A).

            (B) __Multiple ADR programs__ 

                No provision of this section shall be construed as precluding any Federal banking agency or the National Credit Union Administration Board from establishing more than 1 alternative means of dispute resolution.
