        (1) to adopt a single form for the filing of core information required to be submitted under Federal law to all such agencies in the reports and statements referred to in subsection (a) of this section; and

        (2) to simplify instructions accompanying such reports and statements and to provide an index to the instructions that is adequate to meet the needs of both filers and users.

    (c) __Review of call report schedule__ 

    Each Federal banking agency shall—

        (1) review the information required by schedules supplementing the core information referred to in subsection (b) of this section; and
