    (a) __Bank reserves__ 

        (1)

            (A) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, sections 371a, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  371b, 371b–1, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  374, 374a, 461, 464, and 465 of this title shall apply to every Federal branch and Federal agency of a foreign bank in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Federal branch or Federal agency were a member bank as that term is defined in [section 221 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s221]; but the Board either by general or specific regulation or ruling may waive the minimum and maximum reserve ratios prescribed under sections 461, 463, 464, 465, and 466 of this title and may prescribe any ratio, not more than 22 per centum, for any obligation of any such Federal branch or Federal agency that the Board may deem reasonable and appropriate, taking into consideration the character of business conducted by such institutions and the need to maintain vigorous and fair competition between and among such institutions and member banks. The Board may impose reserve requirements on Federal branches and Federal agencies in such graduated manner as it deems reasonable and appropriate.

            (B) After consultation and in cooperation with the State bank supervisory authorities, the Board may make applicable to any State branch or State agency any requirement made applicable to, or which the Board has authority to impose upon, any Federal branch or agency under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

        (2) A branch or agency shall be subject to this subsection only if (A) its parent foreign bank has total worldwide consolidated bank assets in excess of $1,000,000,000; (B) its parent foreign bank is controlled by a foreign company which owns or controls foreign banks that in the aggregate have total worldwide consolidated bank assets in excess of $1,000,000,000; or (C) its parent foreign bank is controlled by a group of foreign companies that own or control foreign banks that in the aggregate have total worldwide consolidated bank assets in excess of $1,000,000,000.

    (b) __Omitted__ 

    (c) __Foreign bank examinations and reporting__ 

        (1) __Examination of branches, agencies, and affiliates__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Board may examine each branch or agency of a foreign bank, each commercial lending company or bank controlled by 1 or more foreign banks or 1 or more foreign companies that control a foreign bank, and other office or affiliate of a foreign bank conducting business in any State.

            (B) __Coordination of examinations__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Board shall coordinate examinations under this paragraph with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and appropriate State bank supervisors to the extent such coordination is possible.

                (ii) __Simultaneous examinations__ 

                    The Board may request simultaneous examinations of each office of a foreign bank and each affiliate of such bank operating in the United States.

                (iii) __Avoidance of duplication__ 

                    In exercising its authority under this paragraph, the Board shall take all reasonable measures to reduce burden and avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations.

            (C) __On-site examination__ 

                Each Federal branch or agency, and each State branch or agency, of a foreign bank shall be subject to on-site examination by an appropriate Federal banking agency or State bank supervisor as frequently as would a national bank or a State bank, respectively, by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

            (D) __Cost of examinations__ 

                The cost of any examination under subparagraph (A) shall be assessed against and collected from the foreign bank or the foreign company that controls the foreign bank, as the case may be, only to the same extent that fees are collected by the Board for examination of any State member bank.

        (2) __Reporting requirements__ 

            Each branch or agency of a foreign bank, other than a Federal branch or agency, shall be subject to [section 335 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s335] and the provision requiring the reports of condition contained in [section 324 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s324] to the same extent and in the same manner as if the branch or agency were a State member bank. In addition to any requirements imposed under [section 3102 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s3102], each Federal branch and agency shall be subject to [section 248(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s248/a] and to [section 483 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s483] to the same extent and in the same manner as if it were a member bank.

    (d) __Establishment of foreign bank offices in United States__ 

        (1) __Prior approval required__ 

            No foreign bank may establish a branch or an agency, or acquire ownership or control of a commercial lending company, without the prior approval of the Board.

        (2) __Required standards for approval__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (6), the Board may not approve an application under paragraph (1) unless it determines that—

            (A) the foreign bank engages directly in the business of banking outside of the United States and is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country; and

            (B) the foreign bank has furnished to the Board the information it needs to adequately assess the application.

        (3) __Standards for approval__ 

        In acting on any application under paragraph (1), the Board may take into account—

            (A) whether the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank have consented to the proposed establishment of a branch, agency or commercial lending company in the United States by the foreign bank;

            (B) the financial and managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the bank’s experience and capacity to engage in international banking;

            (C) whether the foreign bank has provided the Board with adequate assurances that the bank will make available to the Board such information on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any affiliate of the bank that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with this chapter, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 \[[12 U.S.C. 1841][/us/usc/t12/s1841] et seq.\], and other applicable Federal law;

            (D) whether the foreign bank and the United States affiliates of the bank are in compliance with applicable United States law; and

            (E) for a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stability of United States financial system, whether the home country of the foreign bank has adopted, or is making demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation for the financial system of such home country to mitigate such risk.

        (4) __Factor__ 

            In acting on an application under paragraph (1), the Board shall not make the size of the foreign bank the sole determinant factor, and may take into account the needs of the community as well as the length of operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United States pursuant to any standard set forth in this chapter.

        (5) __Establishment of conditions__ 

            The Board may impose such conditions on its approval under this subsection as it deems necessary.

        (6) __Exception__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the Board is unable to find, under paragraph (2), that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country, the Board may nevertheless approve an application by such foreign bank under paragraph (1) if—

                (i) the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank are actively working to establish arrangements for the consolidated supervision of such bank; and

                (ii) all other factors are consistent with approval.

            (B) __Other considerations__ 

                In deciding whether to use its discretion under subparagraph (A), the Board shall also consider whether the foreign bank has adopted and implements procedures to combat money laundering. The Board may also take into account whether the home country of the foreign bank is developing a legal regime to address money laundering or is participating in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering.

            (C) __Additional conditions__ 

                In approving an application under this paragraph, the Board, after requesting and taking into consideration the views of the appropriate State bank supervisor or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may impose such conditions or restrictions relating to the activities or business operations of the proposed branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary, including restrictions on sources of funding, as are considered appropriate. The Board shall coordinate with the appropriate State bank supervisor or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, in the implementation of such conditions or restrictions.

            (D) __Modification of conditions__ 

                Any condition or restriction imposed by the Board in connection with the approval of an application under authority of this paragraph may be modified or withdrawn.

        (7) __Time period for Board action__ 

            (A) __Final action__ 

                The Board shall take final action on any application under paragraph (1) not later than 180 days after receipt of the application, except that the Board may extend for an additional 180 days the period within which to take final action on such application after providing notice of, and the reasons for, the extension to the applicant foreign bank and any appropriate State bank supervisor or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate.

            (B) __Failure to submit information__ 

                The Board may deny any application if it does not receive information requested from the applicant foreign bank or appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank in sufficient time to permit the Board to evaluate such information adequately within the time periods for final action set forth in subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Waiver__ 

                A foreign bank may waive the applicability of this paragraph with respect to any application under paragraph (1).

    (e) __Termination of foreign bank offices in United States__ 

        (1) __Standards for termination__ 

        The Board, after notice and opportunity for hearing and notice to any appropriate State bank supervisor, may order a foreign bank that operates a State branch or agency or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States to terminate the activities of such branch, agency, or subsidiary if the Board finds that—

            (A)

                (i) the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country; and

                (ii) the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank are not making demonstrable progress in establishing arrangements for the comprehensive supervision or regulation of such foreign bank on a consolidated basis;

            (B)

                (i) there is reasonable cause to believe that such foreign bank, or any affiliate of such foreign bank, has committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States; and

                (ii) as a result of such violation or practice, the continued operation of the foreign bank’s branch, agency or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States would not be consistent with the public interest or with the purposes of this chapter, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 \[[12 U.S.C. 1841][/us/usc/t12/s1841] et seq.\], or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1811][/us/usc/t12/s1811] et seq.\]; or

            (C) for a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stability of the United States financial system, the home country of the foreign bank has not adopted, or made demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation to mitigate such risk.

            However, in making findings under this paragraph, the Board shall not make size the sole determinant factor, and may take into account the needs of the community as well as the length of operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United States pursuant to any standard set forth in this chapter.

        (2) __Discretion to deny hearing__ 

            The Board may issue an order under paragraph (1) without providing for an opportunity for a hearing if the Board determines that expeditious action is necessary in order to protect the public interest.

        (3) __Effective date of termination order__ 

            An order issued under paragraph (1) shall take effect before the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date such order is issued unless the Board extends such period.

            Any foreign bank required to terminate activities conducted at offices or subsidiaries in the United States pursuant to this subsection shall comply with the requirements of applicable Federal and State law with respect to procedures for the closure or dissolution of such offices or subsidiaries.

        (5) __Recommendation to agency for termination of a Federal branch or agency__ 

            The Board may transmit to the Comptroller of the Currency a recommendation that the license of any Federal branch or Federal agency of a foreign bank be terminated in accordance with [section 3102(i) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s3102/i] if the Board has reasonable cause to believe that such foreign bank or any affiliate of such foreign bank has engaged in conduct for which the activities of any State branch or agency may be terminated under paragraph (1).

        (6) __Enforcement of orders__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of contumacy of any office or subsidiary of the foreign bank against which—

                (i) the Board has issued an order under paragraph (1); or

                (ii) the Comptroller of the Currency has issued an order under [section 3102(i) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s3102/i],

                or a refusal by such office or subsidiary to comply with such order, the Board or the Comptroller of the Currency may invoke the aid of the district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the office or subsidiary is located.

                Any court referred to in subparagraph (A) may issue an order requiring compliance with an order referred to in subparagraph (A).

        (7) __Criteria relating to foreign supervision__ 

            Not later than 1 year after December 19, 1991, the Board, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall develop and publish criteria to be used in evaluating the operation of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis. In developing such criteria, the Board shall allow reasonable opportunity for public review and comment.

    (f) __Judicial review__ 

        (1) __Jurisdiction of United States courts of appeals__

            (C) against which the Comptroller of the Currency has issued an order under [section 3102(i) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s3102/i],
