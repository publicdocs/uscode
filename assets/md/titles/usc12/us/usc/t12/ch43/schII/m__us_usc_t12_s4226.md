([Pub. L. 101–647, title XXV][/us/pl/101/647/tXXV], § 2581, Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4902][/us/stat/104/4902].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 4221 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4221], referred to in subsec. (c)(1), was in the original “section 831”, and was translated as reading “section 2576”, meaning [section 2576 of Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647/s2576], as the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647] does not contain a section 831.
