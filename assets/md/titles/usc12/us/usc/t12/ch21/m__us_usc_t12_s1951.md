## § 1951. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

    (a) The Congress finds that certain records maintained by businesses engaged in the functions described in [section 1953(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1953/b] have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings.

    (b) It is the purpose of this chapter to require the maintenance of appropriate types of rec­ords and the making of appropriate reports by such businesses in the United States where such records or reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.
