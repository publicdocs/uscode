        Except as provided in subsections (b)(3) and (c)(1)(B) of [section 4002 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4002], if any provision of this chapter requires that funds be available for withdrawal on any business day, such funds shall be available for withdrawal at the start of such business day.

    (c) __Effect on policies of depository institutions__ 

    No provision of this chapter shall be construed as—

        (1) prohibiting a depository institution from making funds available for withdrawal in a shorter period of time than the period of time required by this chapter; or

        (2)

         affecting a depository institution’s right—

            (A) to accept or reject a check for deposit;

        In any case in which a check is deposited in an account at a depository institution and the funds represented by such check are not yet available for withdrawal pursuant to this chapter, the depository institution may not freeze any other funds in such account (which are otherwise available for withdrawal pursuant to this chapter) solely because the funds so deposited are not yet available for withdrawal.

    (e) __Employee training on and compliance with requirements of this chapter__ 

    Each depository institution shall—

        (1) take such actions as may be necessary fully to inform each employee (who performs duties subject to the requirements of this chapter) of the requirements of this chapter; and
