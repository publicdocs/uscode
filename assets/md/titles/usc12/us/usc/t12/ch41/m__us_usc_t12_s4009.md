        The terms used in paragraph (1) that are not defined in this chapter or otherwise defined in section 3(s) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ([12 U.S.C. 1813(s)][/us/usc/t12/s1813/s]) shall have the meaning given to them in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978 ([12 U.S.C. 3101][/us/usc/t12/s3101]).

    (b) __Additional powers__ 

        (1) __Violation of this chapter treated as violation of other Acts__ 

            For purposes of the exercise by any agency referred to in subsection (a) of this section of its powers under any Act referred to in that subsection, a violation of any requirement imposed under this chapter shall be deemed to be a violation of a requirement imposed under that Act.

        (2) __Enforcement authority under other Acts__ 

            In addition to its powers under any provision of law specifically referred to in subsection (a) of this section, each of the agencies referred to in such subsection may exercise, for purposes of enforcing compliance with any requirement imposed under this chapter, any other authority conferred on it by law.

    (c) __Enforcement by Board__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except to the extent that enforcement of the requirements imposed under this chapter is specifically committed to some other Government agency under subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall enforce such requirements.

        (2) __Additional remedy__ 

        If the Board determines that—

    (d) __Procedural rules__ 

        The authority of the Board to prescribe regulations under this chapter does not impair the authority of any other agency designated in this section to make rules regarding its own procedures in enforcing compliance with requirements imposed under this chapter.
