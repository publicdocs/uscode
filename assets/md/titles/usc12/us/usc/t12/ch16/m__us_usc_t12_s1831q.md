## § 1831q. FDIC affordable housing program

    (a) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this section is to provide homeownership and rental housing opportunities for very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income families.

    (b) __Funding and limitations of program__ 

        (1) __Duration of program__ 

            The provisions of this section shall be effective, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), only during the 3-year period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).

        (2) __Annual fiscal limitations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the provisions of this section shall apply only—

                (i) to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts for any losses resulting during the fiscal year from the sale of properties under this section, except that such amounts for losses may not exceed $30,000,000 in any fiscal year; and

                (ii) to the extent that amounts are provided in appropriations Acts pursuant to subparagraph (C) for any other costs relating to the program under this section.

            (B) __Definition of losses__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of losses resulting from the sale of properties under this section during any fiscal year shall be the amount equal to the sum of any affordable housing discounts reasonably anticipated to accrue during the fiscal year.

            (C) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

                There are authorized to be appropriated, for each fiscal year during the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), such sums as may be necessary for any costs of the program under this section other than losses resulting from the sale of properties under this section.

            (D) __Other definitions__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph:

                (i) __Affordable housing discount__ 

                    The term “affordable housing discount” means, with respect to any eligible residential or eligible condominium property transferred under this section by the Corporation, the difference (if any) between the realizable disposition value of the property and the actual sale price of the property under this section.

                (ii) __Realizable disposition value__ 

                    The term “realizable disposition value” means the estimated sale price that the Corporation reasonably would be able to obtain upon the sale of a property by the Corporation under the provisions of this chapter, not including this section, and any other applicable laws. Not later than the expiration of the 120-day period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), the Corporation shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, procedures for determining the realizable disposition value of a property transferred under this section, which shall take into consideration such factors as the Corporation considers appropriate, including the actual sale prices of properties disposed of by the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, the prices of other properties sold under similar programs, and the appraised value of the property transferred under this section. Until such procedures are established, the Corporation may consider the realizable disposition value of any eligible residential or condominium property to be equal to the appraised value of the property.

        (3) __Existing contracts__ 

            The provisions of this section shall not apply to any eligible residential property or any eligible condominium property that is subject to an agreement entered into by the Corporation before the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) that provides for any other disposition of the property.

    (c) __Rules governing disposition of eligible single family properties__ 

        (1) __Notice to clearinghouses__ 

            Within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to an eligible single family property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to clearinghouses. Such notice shall contain basic information about the property, including but not limited to location, condition, and information relating to the estimated fair market value of the property. Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to other public agencies, other nonprofit organizations, and qualifying households. The Corporation shall allow public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and qualifying households reasonable access to eligible single family property for purposes of inspection.

        (2) __Offers to sell to nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and qualifying households__ 

        During the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation shall offer to sell the property to—

            (A) qualifying households (including qualifying households with members who are veterans); or

            (B) public agencies or nonprofit organizations that agree to (i) make the property available for occupancy by and maintain it as affordable for low-income families (including low-income families with members who are veterans) for the remaining useful life of such property, or (ii) make the property available for purchase by any such family who, except as provided in paragraph (4), agrees to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months and certifies in writing that the family intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.

            The restrictions described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument. If, upon the expiration of such 180-day period, no qualifying household, public agency, or nonprofit organization has made a bona fide offer to purchase the property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property to any purchaser. The Corporation shall actively market eligible single family properties for sale to low-income families and to low-income families with members who are veterans.

        (3) __Recapture of profits from resale__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (4), if any eligible single family property sold (A) to a qualifying household, or (B) to a low-income family pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(ii), subsection (j)(3)(A) of this section, or subsection (k)(2) of this section, is resold by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or low-income family, the Corporation shall recapture 75 percent of the amount of any proceeds from the resale that exceed the sum of (i) the original sale price for the acquisition of the property by the qualifying household or low-income family, (ii) the costs of any improvements to the property made after the date of the acquisition, and (iii) any closing costs in connection with the acquisition.

        (4) __Exceptions to recapture requirement__ 

            (A) __Relocation__ 

                The Corporation may in its discretion waive the applicability (i) to any qualifying household of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the requirements relating to residency of a qualifying household under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (p)(12) of this section, and (ii) to any low-income family of the requirement under paragraph (3) and the residency requirements under paragraph (2)(B)(ii). The Corporation may grant any such waiver only for good cause shown, including any necessary relocation of the qualifying household or low-income family.

            (B) __Other recapture provisions__ 

                The requirement under paragraph (3) shall not apply to any eligible single family property for which, upon resale by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, a portion of the sale proceeds or any subsidy provided in connection with the acquisition of the property by the household or family is required to be recaptured or repaid under any other Federal, State, or local law (including [section 143(m) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s143/m]) or regulation or under any sale agreement.

        (5) __Exception to avoid displacement of existing residents__ 

            Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (2), during the 180-day period following the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation may sell the property to the household residing in the property, but only if (A) such household was residing in the property at the time notice regarding the property was provided to clearinghouses under paragraph (1), (B) such sale is necessary to avoid the displacement of, and unnecessary hardship to, the resident household, (C) the resident household intends to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months, and (D) the resident household certifies in writing that the household intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.

    (d) __Rules governing disposition of eligible multifamily housing properties__

Such notice shall contain basic information about the property, including but not limited to location, number of units (identified by number of bedrooms), and information relating to the estimated fair market value of the property. Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to qualifying multifamily purchasers. The Corporation shall allow qualifying multifamily purchasers reasonable access to eligible multifamily housing properties for purposes of inspection.

        (2) __Expression of serious interest__ 

            Qualifying multifamily purchasers may give written notice of serious interest in a property during a period ending 90 days after the time the Corporation provides notice under paragraph (1). The notice of serious interest shall be in such form and include such information as the Corporation may prescribe.

        (3) __Notice of readiness for sale__ 

            Upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2) for a property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to any qualifying multifamily purchaser that has expressed serious interest in the property.

        (4) __Offers by qualifying multifamily purchasers__ 

            A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose offer is accepted during the 45-day period to purchase the property before the expiration of the period.

        (5) __Extension of restricted offer periods__ 

        The Corporation may provide notice to clearinghouses regarding, and offer for sale under the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4), any eligible multifamily housing property—

            (A) in which no qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest during the period referred to in paragraph (2), or

            (B) for which no qualifying multifamily purchaser has made a bona fide offer before the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (4),

            except that the Corporation may, in the discretion of the Corporation, alter the duration of the periods referred to in paragraphs (2) and (4) in offering any property for sale under this paragraph.

        (6) __Sale of multifamily properties to other purchasers__ 

            (A) __Timing__ 

                If, upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2), no qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest in a property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any purchaser.

            (B) __Limitation on combination sales__ 

                The Corporation may not sell in combination with other properties any property for which a qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest in purchasing individually.

            (C) __Expiration of offer period__ 

                If, upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (4), no qualifying multifamily purchaser has made an offer to purchase a property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any purchaser.

        (7) __Low-income occupancy requirements__ 

            (A) __Single property purchases__ 

            With respect to any purchase of a single eligible multifamily housing property by a qualifying multifamily purchaser under paragraph (4) or (5)—

                (i) not less than 35 percent of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income and very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located; provided that

                (ii) not less than 20 percent of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located.

            (B) __Aggregation requirements for multiproperty purchases__ 

            With respect to any purchase under paragraph (4) or (5) by a qualifying multifamily purchaser involving more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, with respect to which the purchaser intends to aggregate the low-income occupancy required under this paragraph over the total number of units so purchased—

                (i) not less than 40 percent of the aggregate number of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income and very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the building or structure in which the units are located; provided that

                (ii) not less than 20 percent of the aggregate number of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the building or structure in which the units are located; and further provided that

                (iii) not less than 10 percent of the dwelling units in each separate property purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located.

            The requirements of this paragraph shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument.

        (8) __Exemptions__ 

            (A) __Continued occupancy of current residents__ 

                No purchaser of an eligible multifamily property may terminate the occupancy of any person residing in the property on the date of purchase for purposes of meeting the low-income occupancy requirement applicable to the property under paragraph (7). The purchaser shall be considered to be in compliance with this subsection if each newly vacant dwelling unit is reserved for low-income occupancy until the low-income occupancy requirement is met.

            (B) __Financial infeasibility__ 

                The Secretary or the State housing finance agency for the State in which an eligible multifamily housing property is located may temporarily reduce the low-income occupancy requirements under paragraph (7) applicable to the property, if the Secretary or such agency determines that an owner’s compliance with such requirements is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return low-income occupancy to the level required under paragraph (7), and the Secretary or the State housing finance agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.

    (e) __Rent limitations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            With respect to properties under paragraph (2), rents charged to tenants for units made available for occupancy by very low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustment for family size. Rents charged to tenants for units made available for occupancy by low-income families other than very low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustment for family size.

        (2) __Applicability__ 

            The rent limitations under this subsection shall apply to any eligible single family property sold pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(B)(i) of this section and to any eligible multifamily housing property sold pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

    (f) __Preferences for sales__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In selling any eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of eligible residential properties, the Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers, to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy or purchase by very low-income and low-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest term.

        (2) __Multiproperty purchases__ 

            The Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers made under paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (d) of this section to purchase more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, to offers made by purchasers who agree to maintain low-income occupancy in each separate property purchased in compliance with the levels required for properties under subsection (d)(7)(A) of this section.

        (3) __Definition of substantially similar offers__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, a given offer to purchase eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of such properties shall be considered to be substantially similar to another offer if the purchase price under such given offer is not less than 85 percent of the purchase price under the other offer.

    (g) __Financing sales__ 

        (1) __Assistance by Corporation__ 

            (A) __Sale price__

The Corporation shall sell eligible multifamily housing property at the net realizable market value, except that the Corporation may agree to sell eligible multifamily housing property at a price below the net realizable market value to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and enable a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to such property under subsection (d)(7) of this section. The Corporation may sell eligible single family property or eligible condominium property to qualifying households, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies without regard to any minimum sale price.

            (B) __Purchase loan__ 

                The Corporation may provide a loan at market interest rates to any purchaser of eligible residential property for all or a portion of the purchase price, which loan shall be secured by a first or second mortgage on the property. The Corporation may provide the loan at below market interest rates to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of eligible residential property and permit (i) a low-income family to purchase an eligible single family property under subsection (c) of this section, or (ii) a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to the purchase of an eligible residential property under subsection (c) or (d) of this section. The Corporation shall provide loans under this subparagraph in a form permitting sale or transfer of the loan to a subsequent holder. In providing financing for combinations of eligible multifamily housing properties under this section, the Corporation may hold a participating share, including a subordinate participation. The Corporation shall periodically provide, to a wide range of minority- and women-owned businesses engaged in providing affordable housing and to nonprofit organizations, more than 50 percent of the control of which is held by 1 or more minority individuals, that are engaged in providing affordable housing, information that is sufficient to inform such businesses and organizations of the availability and terms of financing under this subparagraph; such information may be provided directly, by notices published in periodicals and other publications that regularly provide information to such businesses or organizations, and through persons and organizations that regularly provide information or services to such businesses or organizations. For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “women-owned business” and “minority-owned business” have the meanings given such terms in section 1441a(r) 1 of this title, and the term “minority” has the meaning given such term in section 1204(c)(3) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.

            (B) __Exemptions__ 

                To the extent necessary to facilitate sale of properties under this paragraph, the requirements of subsections (c) and (f) of this section and of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to such transactions and properties involved in such transactions.
