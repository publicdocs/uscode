## § 1831n. Accounting objectives, standards, and requirements

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Objectives__ 

        Accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with Federal banking agencies by insured depository institutions should—

            (A) result in financial statements and reports of condition that accurately reflect the capital of such institutions;

            (B) facilitate effective supervision of the institutions; and

            (C) facilitate prompt corrective action to resolve the institutions at the least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund.

        (2) __Standards__ 

            (A) __Uniform accounting principles consistent with GAAP__ 

                Subject to the requirements of this chapter and any other provision of Federal law, the accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with Federal banking agencies by all insured depository institutions shall be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

            (B) __Stringency__ 

                If the appropriate Federal banking agency or the Corporation determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured depository institution is inconsistent with the objectives described in paragraph (1), the agency or the Corporation may, with respect to reports or statements required to be filed with such agency or Corporation, prescribe an accounting principle which is applicable to such institutions which is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.

        (3) __Review and implementation of accounting principles required__ 

        Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on December 19, 1991, each appropriate Federal banking agency shall take the following actions:

            (A) __Review of accounting principles__ 

            Review—

                (i) all accounting principles used by depository institutions with respect to reports or statements required to be filed with a Federal banking agency;

                (ii) all requirements established by the agency with respect to such accounting procedures; and

                (iii) the procedures and format for reports to the agency, including reports of condition.

            (B) __Modification of noncomplying measures__ 

                Modify or eliminate any accounting principle or reporting requirement of such Federal agency which the agency determines fails to comply with the objectives and standards established under paragraphs (1) and (2).

            (C) __Inclusion of “off balance sheet” items__ 

                Develop and prescribe regulations which require that all assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, of insured depository institutions be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition, or other report of such institution, required to be filed with a Federal banking agency.

    (b) __Uniform accounting of capital standards__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall maintain uniform accounting standards to be used for determining compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements of depository institutions.

        (2) __Transition provision__ 

            Any standards in effect on December 19, 1991, under section 1833d  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title shall continue in effect after December 19, 1991, until amended by the appropriate Federal banking agency under paragraph (1).

    (c) __Reports to banking committees__ 

        (1) __Annual reports required__ 

            The Federal banking agencies shall jointly submit an annual report to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing a description of any difference between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.

        (2) __Explanation of reasons for discrepancy__ 

            Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall contain an explanation of the reasons for any discrepancy between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.

        (3) __Publication__ 

            Each report under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.
