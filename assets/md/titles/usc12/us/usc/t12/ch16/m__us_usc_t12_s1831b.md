## § 1831b. Disclosures with respect to certain federally related mortgage loans

        No insured depository institution, insured branch of a foreign bank, or mutual savings or cooperative bank which is not an insured depository institution, shall make any federally related mortgage loan to any agent, trustee, nominee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity without the prior condition that the identity of the person receiving the beneficial interest of such loan shall at all times be revealed to the insured depository institution, insured branch, or bank. At the request of the Corporation, the insured depository institution, insured branch, or bank shall report to the Corporation on the identity of such person and the nature and amount of the loan, discount, or other extension of credit.
