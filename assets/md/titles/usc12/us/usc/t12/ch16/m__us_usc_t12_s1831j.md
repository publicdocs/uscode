The complainant shall also file a copy of the complaint initiating such action with the appropriate Federal banking agency.

    (c) __Remedies__ 

    If the district court determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, it may order the depository institution, Federal home loan bank, Federal Reserve bank, or Federal banking agency which committed the violation—

        (1) to reinstate the employee to his former position;

        (2) to pay compensatory damages; or

        (3) take other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.

    (d) __Limitation__ 

    The protections of this section shall not apply to any employee who—

        (1) deliberately causes or participates in the alleged violation of law or regulation; or

        (2) knowingly or recklessly provides substantially false information to such an agency or the Attorney General.

    (e) __“Federal banking agency” defined__ 

        For purposes of subsections (a) and (c), the term “Federal banking agency” means the Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Comptroller of the Currency.

    (f) __Burdens of proof__ 

        The legal burdens of proof that prevail under subchapter III of chapter 12 of title 5 shall govern adjudication of protected activities under this section.
