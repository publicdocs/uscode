## § 1831p–1. Standards for safety and soundness

    (a) __Operational and managerial standards__ 

    Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall, for all insured depository institutions, prescribe—

        (1)

         standards relating to—

            (A) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems, in accordance with [section 1831m of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831m];

            (B) loan documentation;

            (C) credit underwriting;

            (D) interest rate exposure;

            (E) asset growth; and

            (F) compensation, fees, and benefits, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; and

    (b) __Asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation standards__ 

        Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall prescribe standards, by regulation or guideline, for all insured depository institutions relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation that the agency determines to be appropriate.

    (c) __Compensation standards__ 

    Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall, for all insured depository institutions, prescribe—

        (1)

         standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any employment contract, compensation or benefit agreement, fee arrangement, perquisite, stock option plan, post­employment benefit, or other compensatory arrangement that—

            (A) would provide any executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder of the institution with excessive compensation, fees or benefits; or

            (B) could lead to material financial loss to the institution;

        (2)

         standards specifying when compensation, fees, or benefits referred to in paragraph (1) are excessive, which shall require the agency to determine whether the amounts are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services actually performed by the individual by considering—

            (A) the combined value of all cash and noncash benefits provided to the individual;

            (B) the compensation history of the individual and other individuals with comparable expertise at the institution;

            (C) the financial condition of the institution;

            (D) comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such factors as asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the loan portfolio or other assets;

            (E) for postemployment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the institution;

            (F) any connection between the individual and any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the institution; and

            (G) other factors that the agency determines to be relevant; and

        (3) such other standards relating to compensation, fees, and benefits as the agency determines to be appropriate.

    (d) __Standards to be prescribed__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Standards under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be prescribed by regulation or guideline. Such regulations or guidelines may not prescribe standards that set a specific level or range of compensation for directors, officers, or employees of insured depository institutions.

        (2) __Applicability of other laws__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not affect the authority of any appropriate Federal banking agency to restrict the level of compensation, including golden parachute payments (as defined in [section 1828(k)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1828/k/4]), paid to any director, officer, or employee of an insured depository institution under any other provision of law.

        (3) __Senior executive officers at undercapitalized institutions__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not affect the authority of any appropriate Federal banking agency to restrict compensation paid to any senior executive officer of an undercapitalized insured depository institution pursuant to section 1831o of this title.

        (4) __Safety and soundness or enforcement actions__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall not be construed as affecting the authority of any appropriate Federal banking agency under any provision of this chapter other than this section, or under any other provision of law, to prescribe a specific level or range of compensation for any director, officer, or employee of an insured depository institution—

            (A) to preserve the safety and soundness of the institution; or

            (B) in connection with any action under [section 1818 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1818] or any order issued by the agency, any agreement between the agency and the institution, or any condition imposed by the agency in connection with the agency’s approval of an application or other request by the institution, which is enforceable under [section 1818 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1818].

    (e) __Failure to meet standards__ 

        (1) __Plan required__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that an insured depository institution fails to meet any standard prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section—

                (i) if such standard is prescribed by regulation of the agency, the agency shall require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to the agency within the time allowed by the agency under subparagraph (C); and

                (ii) if such standard is prescribed by guideline, the agency may require the institution to submit a plan described in clause (i).

            (B) __Contents of plan__ 

                Any plan required under subparagraph (A) shall specify the steps that the institution will take to correct the deficiency. If the institution is undercapitalized, the plan may be part of a capital restoration plan.

            (C) __Deadlines for submission and review of plans__ 

            The appropriate Federal banking agency shall by regulation establish deadlines that—

                (i) provide institutions and companies with reasonable time to submit plans required under subparagraph (A), and generally require the institution to submit a plan not later than 30 days after the agency determines that the institution fails to meet any standard prescribed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section; and

                (ii) require the agency to act on plans expeditiously, and generally not later than 30 days after the plan is submitted.

        (2) __Order required if institution fails to submit or implement plan__ 

        If an insured depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed under paragraph (1)(C), or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the appropriate Federal banking agency, the agency, by order—

            (A) shall require the institution to correct the deficiency; and

            (B)

             may do 1 or more of the following until the deficiency has been corrected:

                (i) Prohibit the institution from permitting its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter, or restrict the rate at which the average total assets of the institution may increase from one calendar quarter to another.

                (ii) Require the institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets.

                (iii) Take the action described in section 1831o(f)(2)(C) of this title.

                (iv) Require the institution to take any other action that the agency determines will better carry out the purpose of section 1831o of this title than any of the actions described in this subparagraph.

        (3) __Restrictions mandatory for certain institutions__ 

        In complying with paragraph (2), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall take 1 or more of the actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) if—

            (A) the agency determines that the insured depository institution fails to meet any standard prescribed under subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section;

            (B) the institution has not corrected the deficiency; and

            (C)

             either—

                (i)

                 during the 24-month period before the date on which the institution first failed to meet the standard—

                    (I) the institution commenced operations; or

                    (II) 1 or more persons acquired control of the institution; or

                (ii) during the 18-month period before the date on which the institution first failed to meet the standard, the institution underwent extraordinary growth, as defined by the agency.

    (f) __Definitions__ 

        For purposes of this section, the terms “average” and “capital restoration plan” have the same meanings as in section 1831o of this title.

    (g) __Other authority not affected__ 

        The authority granted by this section is in addition to any other authority of the Federal banking agencies.
