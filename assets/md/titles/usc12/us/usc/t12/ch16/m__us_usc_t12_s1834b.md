            (D) invests in a community development organization jointly controlled by two or more institutions;

        (2)

         except in the case of an institution which is a community development bank, the amount of the capital invested, in the form of debt or equity, by the institution in the community development organization referred to in paragraph (1) (or, in the case of any community development unit, the amount which the institution irrevocably makes available to such unit for the purposes described in paragraph (3)) is not less than the greater of—

         the community development bank has a 15-member advisory board designated as the “Community Investment Board” and consisting entirely of community leaders who—

            (A) shall be appointed initially by the board of directors of the community development bank and thereafter by the Community Investment Board from nominations received from the community; and

            (B) are appointed for a single term of 2 years, except that, of the initial members appointed to the Community Investment Board, ⅓ shall be appointed for a term of 8 months, ⅓ shall be appointed for a term of 16 months, and ⅓ shall be appointed for a term of 24 months, as designated by the board of directors of the community development bank at the time of the appointment;

        (2) ⅓ of the members of the community development bank’s board of directors are appointed from among individuals nominated by the Community Investment Board; and
