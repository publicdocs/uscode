        Of any amount which the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board may require the Federal Home Loan Banks to invest in capital stock of the Funding Corporation under this subsection in excess of the $1,000,000,000 amount referred to in paragraph (4), the amount which each Federal Home Loan Bank (or any successor to such Bank) shall invest shall be determined by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board by multiplying the excess amount by the percentage arrived at by dividing—

            (B) the sum of the total assets (as of such date) held by all Savings Association Insurance Fund members as of the date of funding which are members of a Federal Home Loan Bank.

        (6) __Special provisions relating to maximum amount limitations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the amount of any Federal Home Loan Bank’s allocation under paragraph (5) exceeds the maximum amount applicable with respect to such Bank (in this paragraph referred to as a “deficient Bank”) under paragraph (3) at the time of such determination (in this paragraph referred to as the “excess amount”)—

                (i) the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board shall require each Federal Home Loan Bank that is not allocated an amount under paragraph (5) that exceeds its maximum under paragraph (3) (in this paragraph referred to as a “remaining Bank”) to purchase stock in the Funding Corporation (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph (5) for such remaining Bank and subject to the maximum amount applicable with respect to such remaining Bank under paragraph (3) at the time of such determination) on behalf of the deficient Bank the amount determined under subparagraph (B);

                (ii) the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board shall require the deficient Bank to subsequently reimburse the remaining Banks out of its net earnings (or reimbursements received from other Banks) in the manner described in subparagraphs (C) and (D); and

                (iii) the requirements contained in subparagraph (D) relating to the use of net earnings shall apply to the deficient Bank until such Bank has reimbursed the remaining Banks for all of the excess amount.

            (B) __Allocation of excess amount among remaining Federal Home Loan Banks__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The amount of stock each remaining Federal Home Loan Bank shall be required to purchase under subparagraph (A)(i) is the amount determined by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board by multiplying the excess amount by the percentage arrived at by dividing—

                    (I) the cumulative amount of stock in the Funding Corporation purchased under this subsection by such remaining Bank at the time of such determination; by

                    (II) the aggregate of the cumulative amounts invested under this subsection by all remaining Banks at such time.

                (ii) __Reallocation__ 

                    If the allocation under this subparagraph results in a remaining Bank exceeding its maximum amount under paragraph (3), such excess amount shall be reallocated to the other remaining Bank in accordance with this subparagraph.

            (C) __Reimbursement procedure__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A Bank on whose behalf stock is purchased under subparagraph (A)(i) shall make payments annually from amounts, if any, in its reserve account (as described in subparagraph (D)) to each Bank that made payments on its behalf until a full reimbursement has been completed. A full reimbursement shall require repayment of the excess amounts invested by other Banks plus interest which shall accrue at a rate equal to the annual average cost of funds in the most recent year to all Federal Home Loan Banks and which shall begin to accrue 2 years after the investments under subparagraph (A)(i) are made.

                (ii) __Determination of amounts__ 

                    The Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board shall annually determine the dollar amounts of such reimbursements by distributing the amount available for such reimbursements (at the time of such determination) from the reimbursing Bank to the Banks that made purchases on its behalf according to the shares of the reimbursing Bank’s excess amount that the other Banks invested.

            (D) __Transfer to account for reimbursements required__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Of the net earnings for any year of a Bank on whose behalf a purchase is made under subparagraph (A)(i) and any reimbursements received from other Banks, the amount necessary to make the reimbursements required under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be placed in a reserve account (established in the manner prescribed by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board), which shall be available only for such reimbursements.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    The total amount placed in such reserve account in any year by any Bank shall not exceed an amount equal to 20 percent of the net earnings of such Bank for such year.

    (f) __Obligations of Funding Corporation__ 

        (1) __Issuance__ 

            The Funding Corporation may issue bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations in an aggregate amount not to exceed $30,000,000,000. No obligation may be issued under this paragraph unless, at the time of issuance, the face amounts (the amount of principal payable at maturity) of noninterest bearing instruments in the Funding Corporation Principal Fund are equal to the aggregate amount of principal on the obligations of the Funding Corporation that will be outstanding following such issuance.

        (2) __Interest payments__ 

        The Funding Corporation shall pay the interest due on such obligations from funds obtained for such interest payments from the following sources:

            (A) __Earnings on certain assets__

                (ii) any proceeds from warrants and participations acquired by the Resolution Trust Corporation.

            (C) __Payments by Federal home loan banks__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    To the extent that the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, each Federal home loan bank shall pay to the Funding Corporation in each calendar year, 20.0 percent of the net earnings of that Bank (after deducting expenses relating to [section 1430(j) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1430/j] and operating expenses).

                (ii) __Annual determination__ 

                    The Director annually shall determine the extent to which the value of the aggregate amounts paid by the Federal home loan banks exceeds or falls short of the value of an annuity of $300,000,000 per year that commences on the issuance date and ends on the final scheduled maturity date of the obligations, and shall select appropriate present value factors for making such determinations, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.

                (iii) __Payment term alterations__ 

                    The Director shall extend or shorten the term of the payment obligations of a Federal home loan bank under this subparagraph as necessary to ensure that the value of all payments made by the Banks is equivalent to the value of an annuity referred to in clause (ii).

                (iv) __Term beyond maturity__ 

                    If the Director extends the term of payment obligations beyond the final scheduled maturity date for the obligations, each Federal home loan bank shall continue to pay 20.0 percent of its net earnings (after deducting expenses relating to [section 1430(j) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1430/j] and operating expenses) to the Treasury of the United States until the value of all such payments by the Federal home loan banks is equivalent to the value of an annuity referred to in clause (ii). In the final year in which the Federal home loan banks are required to make any payment to the Treasury under this subparagraph, if the dollar amount represented by 20.0 percent of the net earnings of the Federal home loan banks exceeds the remaining obligation of the Banks to the Treasury, the Director shall reduce the percentage pro rata to a level sufficient to pay the remaining obligation.

                (v) __Semiannual reports__ 

                    The Director shall report semiannually to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on the projected date for the completion of contributions required by this section.

            (D) __Proceeds from sale of assets__ 

                To the extent the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, the FSLIC Resolution Fund shall transfer to the Funding Corporation any net proceeds from the sale of assets received from the Resolution Trust Corporation, which shall be used by the Funding Corporation to pay such interest.

            (E) __Treasury backup__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    To the extent the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the Funding Corporation the additional amount due, which shall be used by the Funding Corporation to pay such interest.

                (ii) __Liability of Funding Corporation__ 

                    In each instance where the Secretary is required to make a payment under this subparagraph to the Funding Corporation, the amount of the payment shall become a liability of the Funding Corporation to be repaid to the Secretary upon dissolution of the Funding Corporation (to the extent the Funding Corporation may have any remaining assets).

                (iii) __Appropriation of funds__ 

                    There are hereby appropriated to the Secretary, for fiscal year 1989 and each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as may be necessary to carry out clause (i).

            On maturity of an obligation issued under this subsection, the obligation shall be repaid by the Funding Corporation from the liquidation of noninterest bearing instruments held in the Funding Corporation Principal Fund.

        (4) __Proceeds to be transferred to Resolution Trust Corporation__ 

        Subject to terms and conditions approved by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board, the proceeds (less any discount, plus any premium, net of issuance costs) of any obligation issued by the Funding Corporation shall be used to—

            (A) purchase the capital certificates issued by the Resolution Trust Corporation under [section 1441a of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1441a]; or

            (B) refund any previously issued obligation the proceeds of which were transferred in the manner described in subparagraph (A).

        (5) __Investment of United States funds in obligations__ 

            Obligations issued under this section by the Funding Corporation, at the direction of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board shall be lawful investments, and may be accepted as security, for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of the United States or any officer of the United States.

        (6) __Market for obligations__ 

            All persons having the power to invest in, sell, underwrite, purchase for their own accounts, accept as security, or otherwise deal in obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks shall also have the power to do so with respect to obligations of the Funding Corporation.

        (7) __Tax exempt status__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), obligations of the Funding Corporation shall be exempt from tax both as to principal and interest to the same extent as any obligation of a Federal Home Loan Bank is exempt from tax under [section 1433 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1433].
