## § 3709. Presale reinstatement

    (a) __Grounds__ 

    Except as provided in sections 3707(b) and 3710(c) of this title, the foreclosure commissioner shall withdraw the security property from foreclosure and cancel the foreclosure sale only if—

        (1) the Secretary so directs the commissioner prior to or at the time of sale;

        (2) the commissioner finds, upon application of the mortgagor at least three days prior to the date of sale, that the default or defaults upon which the foreclosure is based did not exist at the time of service of the notice of default and foreclosure sale; or

        (3)

            (A) in the case of a foreclosure involving a monetary default, there is tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed the entire amount of principal and interest which would be due if payments under the mortgage had not been accelerated; (B) in the case of a foreclosure involving a nonmonetary default, the foreclosure commissioner, upon application of the mortgagor before the date of foreclosure sale, finds that such default is cured; and (C) there is tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed all amounts due under the mortgage agreement (excluding additional amounts which would have been due if mortgage payments had been accelerated), all amounts of expenditures secured by the mortgage and all costs of foreclosure incurred for which payment from the proceeds of foreclosure is provided in [section 3711 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s3711], except that the Secretary shall have discretion to refuse to cancel a foreclosure pursuant to this paragraph (3) if the current mortgagor or owner of record has on one or more previous occasions caused a foreclosure of the mortgage, commenced pursuant to this chapter or otherwise, to be canceled by curing a default.

    (b) __Views of Secretary__ 

        Prior to withdrawing the security property from foreclosure in the circumstances described in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3), the foreclosure commissioner shall afford the Secretary a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate why the security property should not be so withdrawn.

    (c) __Mortgage subsequent to reinstatement__ 

        In any case in which a foreclosure commenced under this chapter is canceled, the mortgage shall continue in effect as though acceleration had not occurred.

    (d) __Subsequent foreclosures__ 

        If the foreclosure commissioner cancels a foreclosure sale under this chapter a new foreclosure may be subsequently commenced as provided in this chapter.
