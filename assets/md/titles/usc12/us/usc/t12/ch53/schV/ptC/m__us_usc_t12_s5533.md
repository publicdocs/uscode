        (1) any confidential commercial information, including an algorithm used to derive credit scores or other risk scores or predictors;

        (2) any information collected by the covered person for the purpose of preventing fraud or money laundering, or detecting, or making any report regarding other unlawful or potentially unlawful conduct;

        (3) any information required to be kept confidential by any other provision of law; or

        (4) any information that the covered person cannot retrieve in the ordinary course of its business with respect to that information.

    (e) __Consultation__ 

    The Bureau shall, when prescribing any rule under this section, consult with the Federal banking agencies and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure, to the extent appropriate, that the rules—

        (1) impose substantively similar requirements on covered persons;

        (2) take into account conditions under which covered persons do business both in the United States and in other countries; and

        (3) do not require or promote the use of any particular technology in order to develop systems for compliance.
