## § 5384. Orderly liquidation of covered financial companies

        (1) shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency or agencies of the covered financial company and its covered subsidiaries for purposes of ensuring an orderly liquidation of the covered financial company;

        (2) may consult with, or under subsection (a)(1)(B)(v) or (a)(1)(L) of [section 5390 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390], acquire the services of, any outside experts, as appropriate to inform and aid the Corporation in the orderly liquidation process;

        (3) shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency or agencies of any subsidiaries of the covered financial company that are not covered subsidiaries, and coordinate with such regulators regarding the treatment of such solvent subsidiaries and the separate resolution of any such insolvent subsidiaries under other governmental authority, as appropriate; and

        (4) shall consult with the Commission and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in the case of any covered financial company for which the Corporation has been appointed as receiver that is a broker or dealer registered with the Commission under section 78o(b) of title 15 and is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for the purpose of determining whether to transfer to a bridge financial company organized by the Corporation as receiver, without consent of any customer, customer accounts of the covered financial company.

    (d) __Funding for orderly liquidation__

All funds provided by the Corporation under this subsection shall have a priority of claims under subparagraph (A) or (B) of [section 5390(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390/b/1], as applicable, including funds used for—
