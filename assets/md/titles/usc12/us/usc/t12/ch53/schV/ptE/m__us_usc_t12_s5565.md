            (H) civil money penalties, as set forth more fully in subsection (c).

        (3) __No exemplary or punitive damages__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authorizing the imposition of exemplary or punitive damages.

    (b) __Recovery of costs__ 

        In any action brought by the Bureau, a State attorney general, or any State regulator to enforce any Federal consumer financial law, the Bureau, the State attorney general, or the State regulator may recover its costs in connection with prosecuting such action if the Bureau, the State attorney general, or the State regulator is the prevailing party in the action.

    (c) __Civil money penalty in court and administrative actions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any person that violates, through any act or omission, any provision of Federal consumer financial law shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty pursuant to this subsection.

        (2) __Penalty amounts__ 

            (A) __First tier__ 

                For any violation of a law, rule, or final order or condition imposed in writing by the Bureau, a civil penalty may not exceed $5,000 for each day during which such violation or failure to pay continues.

            (B) __Second tier__

        (3) __Mitigating factors__ 

        In determining the amount of any penalty assessed under paragraph (2), the Bureau or the court shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to—

            (A) the size of financial resources and good faith of the person charged;

            (B) the gravity of the violation or failure to pay;

            (C) the severity of the risks to or losses of the consumer, which may take into account the number of products or services sold or provided;

            (E) such other matters as justice may require.

        (4) __Authority to modify or remit penalty__ 

            The Bureau may compromise, modify, or remit any penalty which may be assessed or had already been assessed under paragraph (2). The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, shall be exclusive of any sums owed by the person to the United States in connection with the costs of the proceeding, and may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.

        (5) __Notice and hearing__ 

        No civil penalty may be assessed under this subsection with respect to a violation of any Federal consumer financial law, unless—

            (A) the Bureau gives notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the person accused of the violation; or

            (B) the appropriate court has ordered such assessment and entered judgment in favor of the Bureau.
