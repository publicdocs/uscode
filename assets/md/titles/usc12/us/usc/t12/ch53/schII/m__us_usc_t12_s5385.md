    (a) __Appointment of SIPC as trustee__ 

        (1) __Appointment__ 

            Upon the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for any covered broker or dealer, the Corporation shall appoint, without any need for court approval, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation to act as trustee for the liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ([15 U.S.C. 78aaa][/us/usc/t15/s78aaa] et seq.) of the covered broker or dealer.

The Federal district court shall accept and approve the filing, including outside of normal business hours, and shall immediately issue the protective decree as to the covered broker or dealer.

            (B) __Administration by SIPC__ 

                Following entry of the protective decree, and except as otherwise provided in this section, the determination of claims and the liquidation of assets retained in the receivership of the covered broker or dealer and not transferred to the bridge financial company shall be administered under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ([15 U.S.C. 78aaa][/us/usc/t15/s78aaa] et seq.) by SIPC, as trustee for the covered broker or dealer.

            (C) __Definition of filing date__

The Corporation shall satisfy customer claims, to the extent that a customer would have received more securities or cash with respect to the allocation of customer property had the covered financial company been subject to a proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act ([15 U.S.C. 78aaa][/us/usc/t15/s78aaa] et seq.) without the appointment of the Corporation as receiver, and with a filing date as of the date on which the Corporation is appointed as receiver.
