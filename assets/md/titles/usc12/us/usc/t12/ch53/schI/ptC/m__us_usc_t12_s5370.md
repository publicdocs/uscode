        In developing the criteria under subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall take into account the factors for consideration described in subsections (a) and (b) of [section 5323 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5323] in determining whether a U.S. nonbank financial company or foreign nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors.
