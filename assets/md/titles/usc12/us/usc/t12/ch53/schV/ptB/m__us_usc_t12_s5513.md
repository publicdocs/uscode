            (B) files the petition with the Council not later than 10 days after the date on which the regulation has been published in the Federal Register.

            (B) __Authorization to vote__ 

            A member of the Council may vote to stay the effectiveness of, or set aside, a final regulation prescribed by the Bureau only if the agency or department represented by that member has—

                (i) considered any relevant information provided by the agency submitting the petition and by the Bureau; and

                (ii) made an official determination, at a public meeting where applicable, that the regulation which is the subject of the petition would put the safety and soundness of the United States banking system or the stability of the financial system of the United States at risk.

        (4) __Decisions to set aside__

                (ii) the expiration of a stay issued by the Council under this section.
