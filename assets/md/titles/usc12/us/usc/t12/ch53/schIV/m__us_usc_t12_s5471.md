 __References in Text__ 

    The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is title VII of [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 1641][/us/stat/124/1641]. Section 728 of the Act amended the [act of Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 369][/us/act/1922-09-21/ch369], to add a new section 21 which is classified to [section 24a of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s24a], Agriculture. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 8301 of Title 15][/us/usc/t15/s8301], Commerce and Trade, and Tables.

    Section 745(b)(3) of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), probably means section 5c(c)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act, which is classified to [section 7a–2(c)(3) of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s7a–2/c/3], Agriculture. Section 745(b) of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which is [section 745(b) of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s745/b], added subsec. (c) of [section 7a–2 of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s7a–2] and struck out former subsec. (c) of that section. [Section 7a–2(c)(3) of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s7a–2/c/3] relates to stays of the certification for rules. [Section 745(b) of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s745/b] does not contain a par. (3).
