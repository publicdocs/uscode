        (2) efforts to avoid duplicative or conflicting rulemakings, including an evaluation of the consultative process under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of [section 5512(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5512/b/2], information requests, and examinations; and

        (3) other matters related to the operations of financial services regulations deemed by the Comptroller General to be appropriate.
