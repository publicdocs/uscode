## § 5602. Reverse mortgage study and regulations

    (a) __Study__ 

        Not later than 1 year after the designated transfer date, the Bureau shall conduct a study on reverse mortgage transactions.

    (b) __Regulations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the Bureau determines through the study required under subsection (a) that conditions or limitations on reverse mortgage transactions are necessary or appropriate for accomplishing the purposes and objectives of this title, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  including protecting borrowers with respect to the obtaining of reverse mortgage loans for the purpose of funding investments, annuities, and other investment products and the suitability of a borrower in obtaining a reverse mortgage for such purpose. <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Sentence does not appear to be complete. </sup></sup> 

        (2) __Identified practices and integrated disclosures__ 

        The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) may, as the Bureau may so determine—

            (A) identify any practice as unfair, deceptive, or abusive in connection with a reverse mortgage transaction; and

            (B) provide for an integrated disclosure standard and model disclosures for reverse mortgage transactions, consistent with section 4302(d),1 that combines the relevant disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act ([15 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t15/s1601] et seq.) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act \[[12 U.S.C. 2601][/us/usc/t12/s2601] et seq.\], with the disclosures required to be provided to consumers for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages under [section 1715z–20 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1715z–20].

    (c) __Rule of construction__ 

        This section shall not be construed as limiting the authority of the Bureau to issue regulations, orders, or guidance that apply to reverse mortgages prior to the completion of the study required under subsection (a).

([Pub. L. 111–203, title X][/us/pl/111/203/tX], § 1076, July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 2075][/us/stat/124/2075].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), is title X of [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 1955][/us/stat/124/1955], known as the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which enacted this subchapter and enacted, amended, and repealed numerous other sections and notes in the Code. For complete classification of title X to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 5301 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5301] and Tables.

    Section 4302(d), referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(B), probably was a reference to section 4302(d) of the House Engrossed version of H.R. 4173, 111th Congress. A later version of H.R. 4173 was enacted as [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203], and as so enacted, doesn’t contain a section 4302. However, [section 1032(f) of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s1032/f], which is classified to [section 5532(f) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5532/f], contains substantially similar provisions to the section 4302(d) that was probably referred to.

    The Truth in Lending Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(B), is title I of [Pub. L. 90–321][/us/pl/90/321], May 29, 1968, [82 Stat. 146][/us/stat/82/146], which is classified generally to subchapter I (§ 1601 et seq.) of chapter 41 of Title 15, Commerce and Trade. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1601 of Title 15][/us/usc/t15/s1601] and Tables.

    The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(B), probably means the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, [Pub. L. 93–533][/us/pl/93/533], Dec. 22, 1974, [88 Stat. 1724][/us/stat/88/1724], which is classified principally to chapter 27 (§ 2601 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 2601 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2601] and Tables.
