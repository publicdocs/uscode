        Not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, the appropriate Federal regulators jointly shall prescribe regulations or guidelines to require each covered financial institution to disclose to the appropriate Federal regulator the structures of all incentive-based compensation arrangements offered by such covered financial institutions sufficient to determine whether the compensation structure—

            (B) could lead to material financial loss to the covered financial institution.

    Not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, the appropriate Federal regulators shall jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines that prohibit any types of incentive-based payment arrangement, or any feature of any such arrangement, that the regulators determine encourages inappropriate risks by covered financial institutions—

        (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder of the covered financial institution with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits; or

        (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the covered financial institution.

        (2) in establishing such standards under such subsections, take into consideration the compensation standards described in [section 1831p–1(c) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831p–1/c].
