        (2) __Preservation of authority__ 

            Nothing in this subsection may be construed as limiting the authority of the Director from requiring from a person described in subsection (a), as permitted under paragraph (1), information owned or under the control of such person, regardless of whether such information is maintained, stored, or processed by another person.

        (3) __Reports of tax law noncompliance__
