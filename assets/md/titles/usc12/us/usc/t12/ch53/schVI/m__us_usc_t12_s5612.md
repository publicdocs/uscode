## § 5612. Emergency financial stabilization

    (a) __In general__ 

        Upon the written determination of the Corporation and the Board of Governors under [section 5611 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5611], the Corporation shall create a widely available program to guarantee obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or solvent depository institution holding companies (including any affiliates thereof) during times of severe economic distress, except that a guarantee of obligations under this section may not include the provision of equity in any form.

    (b) __Rulemaking and terms and conditions__ 

        (1) __Policies and procedures__ 

            As soon as is practicable after July 21, 2010, the Corporation shall establish, by regulation, and in consultation with the Secretary, policies and procedures governing the issuance of guarantees authorized by this section. Such policies and procedures may include a requirement of collateral as a condition of any such guarantee.

        (2) __Terms and conditions__ 

            The terms and conditions of any guarantee program shall be established by the Corporation, with the concurrence of the Secretary.

    (c) __Determination of guaranteed amount__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In connection with any program established pursuant to subsection (a) and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary (in consultation with the President) shall determine the maximum amount of debt outstanding that the Corporation may guarantee under this section, and the President may transmit to Congress a written report on the plan of the Corporation to exercise the authority under this section to issue guarantees up to that maximum amount and a request for approval of such plan. The Corporation shall exercise the authority under this section to issue guarantees up to that specified maximum amount upon passage of the joint resolution of approval, as provided in subsection (d). Absent such approval, the Corporation shall issue no such guarantees.

        (2) __Additional debt guarantee authority__ 

            If the Secretary (in consultation with the President) determines, after a submission to Congress under paragraph (1), that the maximum guarantee amount should be raised, and the Council concurs with that determination, the President may transmit to Congress a written report on the plan of the Corporation to exercise the authority under this section to issue guarantees up to the increased maximum debt guarantee amount. The Corporation shall exercise the authority under this section to issue guarantees up to that specified maximum amount upon passage of the joint resolution of approval, as provided in subsection (d). Absent such approval, the Corporation shall issue no such guarantees.

    (d) __Resolution of approval__ 

        (1) __Additional debt guarantee authority__ 

            A request by the President under this section shall be considered granted by Congress upon adoption of a joint resolution approving such request. Such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate under expedited procedures.

        (2) __Fast track consideration in Senate__ 

            (A) __Reconvening__ 

                Upon receipt of a request under subsection (c), if the Senate has adjourned or recessed for more than 2 days, the majority leader of the Senate, after consultation with the minority leader of the Senate, shall notify the Members of the Senate that, pursuant to this section, the Senate shall convene not later than the second calendar day after receipt of such message.

            (B) __Placement on calendar__ 

                Upon introduction in the Senate, the joint resolution shall be placed immediately on the calendar.

            (C) __Floor consideration__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any time during the period beginning on the 4th day after the date on which Congress receives a request under subsection (c), and ending on the 7th day after that date (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, and all points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business until disposed of.

                (ii) __Debate__ 

                    Debate on the joint resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the majority and minority leaders or their designees. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order.

                (iii) __Vote on passage__ 

                    The vote on passage shall occur immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the joint resolution, and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.

                (iv) __Rulings of the Chair on procedure__ 

                    Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution shall be decided without debate.

                If the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint resolution under this section, the joint resolution of the House of Representatives shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this subsection.

([Pub. L. 111–203, title XI][/us/pl/111/203/tXI], § 1105, July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 2121][/us/stat/124/2121].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 1105 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, referred to in subsec. (d)(4)(C), (D), is [section 1105 of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s1105], which is classified to this section.

    Section 208(n)(5)(E), referred to in subsec. (e)(5), probably means [section 210(n)(5)(E) of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s210/n/5/E], which is classified to [section 5390(n)(5)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390/n/5/E], because section 208 does not contain a subsec. (n) and section 210(n)(5)(E) relates to treatment of certain purchases and sales of obligations by the Secretary as public debt.
