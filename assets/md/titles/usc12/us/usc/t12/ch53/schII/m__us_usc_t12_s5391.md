 __References in Text__ 

    This subchapter, referred to in subsecs. (d)(1), (2), (4)(B), (5), (e)(1), (2), and (f)(2), was in the original “this title”, meaning title II of [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 1442][/us/stat/124/1442], which is classified principally to this subchapter. For complete classification of title II to the Code, see Tables.

    [Section 5390(n)(14) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390/n/14], referred to in subsec. (d)(1)(C), probably means section 5390(n)(9), because [section 5390(n) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390/n] does not contain a par. (14) and [section 5390(n)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5390/n/9] relates to orderly liquidation plans.

    The Inspector General Act of 1978, referred to in subsecs. (d)(3) and (e)(3), is [Pub. L. 95–452][/us/pl/95/452], Oct. 12, 1978, [92 Stat. 1101][/us/stat/92/1101], which is set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
