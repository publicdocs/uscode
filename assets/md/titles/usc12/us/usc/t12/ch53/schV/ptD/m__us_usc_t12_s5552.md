        (3) __Rule of construction__ 

            No provision of this title 1 shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the authority of a State attorney general or State regulator to enforce such Federal law.

    (b) __Consultation required__ 

        (1) __Notice__ 

            (A) __In general__

    (d) __Preservation of State authority__ 

        (1) __State claims__ 

            No provision of this section shall be construed as altering, limiting, or affecting the authority of a State attorney general or any other regulatory or enforcement agency or authority to bring an action or other regulatory proceeding arising solely under the law in effect in that State.

        (2) __State securities regulators__ 

            No provision of this title 1 shall be construed as altering, limiting, or affecting the authority of a State securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) under State law to adopt rules, initiate enforcement proceedings, or take any other action with respect to a person regulated by such commission or authority.
