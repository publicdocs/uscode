## § 5551. Relation to State law

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Rule of construction__ 

            This title, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  other than sections 1044 through 1048, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  may not be construed as annulling, altering, or affecting, or exempting any person subject to the provisions of this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  from complying with, the statutes, regulations, orders, or interpretations in effect in any State, except to the extent that any such provision of law is inconsistent with the provisions of this title, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.

        (2) __Greater protection under State law__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in effect in any State is not inconsistent with the provisions of this title 1 if the protection that such statute, regulation, order, or interpretation affords to consumers is greater than the protection provided under this title.1 A determination regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in effect in any State is inconsistent with the provisions of this title 1 may be made by the Bureau on its own motion or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by any interested person.

    (b) __Relation to other provisions of enumerated consumer laws that relate to State law__ 

        No provision of this title,1 except as provided in section 1083,1 shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect to such Federal law.

    (c) __Additional consumer protection regulations in response to State action__ 

        (1) __Notice of proposed rule required__ 

            The Bureau shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever a majority of the States has enacted a resolution in support of the establishment or modification of a consumer protection regulation by the Bureau.

        (2) __Bureau considerations required for issuance of final regulation__ 

        Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into account whether—

            (A) the proposed regulation would afford greater protection to consumers than any existing regulation;

            (B) the intended benefits of the proposed regulation for consumers would outweigh any increased costs or inconveniences for consumers, and would not discriminate unfairly against any category or class of consumers; and

            (C) a Federal banking agency has advised that the proposed regulation is likely to present an unacceptable safety and soundness risk to insured depository institutions.

        (3) __Explanation of considerations__ 

        The Bureau—

            (A) shall include a discussion of the considerations required in paragraph (2) in the Federal Register notice of a final regulation prescribed pursuant to this subsection; and

            (B) whenever the Bureau determines not to prescribe a final regulation, shall publish an explanation of such determination in the Federal Register, and provide a copy of such explanation to each State that enacted a resolution in support of the proposed regulation, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.

        (4) __Reservation of authority__ 

            No provision of this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards established pursuant to this title 1 in response to its own motion or in response to a request by any other interested person.

        (5) __Rule of construction__ 

            No provision of this subsection shall be construed as exempting the Bureau from complying with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.

        (6) __Definition__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “consumer protection regulation” means a regulation that the Bureau is authorized to prescribe under the Federal consumer financial laws.
