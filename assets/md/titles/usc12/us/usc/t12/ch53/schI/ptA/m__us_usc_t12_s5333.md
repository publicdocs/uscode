            (E) requirements to carry contingent capital or similar mechanisms;

            (F) limits on commingling of commercial and financial activities by large financial institutions;

            (G) segregation requirements between traditional financial activities and trading or other high-risk operations in large financial institutions; and

            (H) other limitations on the activities or structure of large financial institutions that may be useful to limit systemic risk.

        (2) __Recommendations__ 

            The study required by this section shall include recommendations for the optimal structure of any limits considered in subparagraphs (A) through (E), in order to maximize their effectiveness and minimize their economic impact.

    (b) __Report__ 

        Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on July 21, 2010, and not later than every 5 years thereafter, the Chairperson shall issue a report to the Congress containing any findings and determinations made in carrying out the study required under subsection (a).
