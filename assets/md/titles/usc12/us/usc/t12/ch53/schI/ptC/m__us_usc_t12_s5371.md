        (1) __Minimum leverage capital requirements__ 

            The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall establish minimum leverage capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors. The minimum leverage capital requirements established under this paragraph shall not be less than the generally applicable leverage capital requirements, which shall serve as a floor for any capital requirements that the agency may require, nor quantitatively lower than the generally applicable leverage capital requirements that were in effect for insured depository institutions as of July 21, 2010.

        (6) __Study and report on small institution access to capital__

        (7) __Capital requirements to address activities that pose risks to the financial system__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to the recommendations of the Council, in accordance with [section 5330 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5330], the Federal banking agencies shall develop capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors that address the risks that the activities of such institutions pose, not only to the institution engaging in the activity, but to other public and private stakeholders in the event of adverse performance, disruption, or failure of the institution or the activity.

            (B) __Content__ 

            Such rules shall address, at a minimum, the risks arising from—

                (ii) concentrations in assets for which the values presented in financial reports are based on models rather than historical cost or prices deriving from deep and liquid 2-way markets; and

        (2) __Rule of construction on Board’s authority__ 

            This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit, modify, limit, or otherwise supersede any other provision of Federal law that provides the Board of Governors authority to issue regulations and orders relating to capital requirements for depository institution holding companies or nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors.

        (3) __Rule of construction on accounting principles__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A depository institution holding company or nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve that is also a person regulated by a State insurance regulator that is engaged in the business of insurance that files financial statements with a State insurance regulator or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners utilizing only Statutory Accounting Principles in accordance with State law, shall not be required by the Board under the authority of this section or the authority of the Home Owners’ Loan Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1461][/us/usc/t12/s1461] et seq.\] to prepare such financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

            (B) __Preservation of authority__
