## § 5323. Authority to require supervision and regulation of certain nonbank financial companies

    (a) __U.S. nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors__ 

        (1) __Determination__ 

            The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than ⅔ of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, may determine that a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards, in accordance with this subchapter, if the Council determines that material financial distress at the U.S. nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

        (2) __Considerations__ 

        In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Council shall consider—

            (A) the extent of the leverage of the company;

            (B) the extent and nature of the off-balance-sheet exposures of the company;

            (C) the extent and nature of the transactions and relationships of the company with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies;

            (D) the importance of the company as a source of credit for households, businesses, and State and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the United States financial system;

            (E) the importance of the company as a source of credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities, and the impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability of credit in such communities;

            (F) the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company, and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse;

            (G) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company;

            (H) the degree to which the company is already regulated by 1 or more primary financial regulatory agencies;

            (I) the amount and nature of the financial assets of the company;

            (J) the amount and types of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding; and

            (K) any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate.

    (b) __Foreign nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors__ 

        (1) __Determination__ 

            The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than ⅔ of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, may determine that a foreign nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards, in accordance with this subchapter, if the Council determines that material financial distress at the foreign nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the foreign nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

        (2) __Considerations__ 

        In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Council shall consider—

            (A) the extent of the leverage of the company;

            (B) the extent and nature of the United States related off-balance-sheet exposures of the company;

            (C) the extent and nature of the transactions and relationships of the company with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies;

            (D) the importance of the company as a source of credit for United States households, businesses, and State and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the United States financial system;

            (E) the importance of the company as a source of credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities in the United States, and the impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability of credit in such communities;

            (F) the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse;

            (G) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company;

            (H) the extent to which the company is subject to prudential standards on a consolidated basis in its home country that are administered and enforced by a comparable foreign supervisory authority;

            (I) the amount and nature of the United States financial assets of the company;

            (J) the amount and nature of the liabilities of the company used to fund activities and operations in the United States, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding; and

            (K) any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate.

    (c) __Antievasion__ 

        (1) __Determinations__ 

        In order to avoid evasion of this subchapter, the Council, on its own initiative or at the request of the Board of Governors, may determine, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than ⅔ of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that—

            (A) material financial distress related to, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of, the financial activities conducted directly or indirectly by a company incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or any State or the financial activities in the United States of a company incorporated or organized in a country other than the United States would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, based on consideration of the factors in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable;

            (B) the company is organized or operates in such a manner as to evade the application of this subchapter; and

            (C) such financial activities of the company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and subject to prudential standards in accordance with this subchapter, consistent with paragraph (3).

        (2) __Report__ 

            Upon making a determination under paragraph (1), the Council shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress detailing the reasons for making such determination.

        (3) __Consolidated supervision of only financial activities; establishment of an intermediate holding company__ 

            (A) __Establishment of an intermediate holding company__ 

                Upon a determination under paragraph (1), the company that is the subject of the determination may establish an intermediate holding company in which the financial activities of such company and its subsidiaries shall be conducted (other than the activities described in [section 5367(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5367/b/2]) in compliance with any regulations or guidance provided by the Board of Governors. Such intermediate holding company shall be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter as if the intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.

            (B) __Action of the Board of Governors__ 

                To facilitate the supervision of the financial activities subject to the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of Governors may require a company to establish an intermediate holding company, as provided for in [section 5367 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5367], which would be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter, as if the intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.

        (4) __Notice and opportunity for hearing and final determination; judicial review__ 

            Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1) in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank financial companies.

        (5) __Covered financial activities__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “financial activities”—

            (A) means activities that are financial in nature (as defined in [section 1843(k) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1843/k]);

            (B) includes the ownership or control of one or more insured depository institutions; and

            (C) does not include internal financial activities conducted for the company or any affiliate thereof, including internal treasury, investment, and employee benefit functions.

        (6) __Only financial activities subject to prudential supervision__ 

            Nonfinancial activities of the company shall not be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards of the Board. For purposes of this Act, the financial activities that are the subject of the determination in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under this subchapter to the financial activities that are subject to the determination in paragraph (1).

    (d) __Reevaluation and rescission__ 

    The Council shall—

        (1) not less frequently than annually, reevaluate each determination made under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to such nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors; and

        (2) rescind any such determination, if the Council, by a vote of not fewer than ⅔ of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, determines that the nonbank financial company no longer meets the standards under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable.

    (e) __Notice and opportunity for hearing and final determination__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Council shall provide to a nonbank financial company written notice of a proposed determination of the Council, including an explanation of the basis of the proposed determination of the Council, that a nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards in accordance with this subchapter.

        (2) __Hearing__ 

            Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of any notice of a proposed determination under paragraph (1), the nonbank financial company may request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest the proposed determination. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which such company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).

        (3) __Final determination__ 

            Not later than 60 days after the date of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Council shall notify the nonbank financial company of the final determination of the Council, which shall contain a statement of the basis for the decision of the Council.

        (4) __No hearing requested__ 

            If a nonbank financial company does not make a timely request for a hearing, the Council shall notify the nonbank financial company, in writing, of the final determination of the Council under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable, not later than 10 days after the date by which the company may request a hearing under paragraph (2).

    (f) __Emergency exception__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Council may waive or modify the requirements of subsection (e) with respect to a nonbank financial company, if the Council determines, by a vote of not fewer than ⅔ of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that such waiver or modification is necessary or appropriate to prevent or mitigate threats posed by the nonbank financial company to the financial stability of the United States.

        (2) __Notice__ 

            The Council shall provide notice of a waiver or modification under this subsection to the nonbank financial company concerned as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours after the waiver or modification is granted.

        (4) __Opportunity for hearing__ 

            The Council shall allow a nonbank financial company to request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest a waiver or modification under this subsection, not later than 10 days after the date of receipt of notice of the waiver or modification by the company. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 15 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which the nonbank financial company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).

        (5) __Notice of final determination__ 

            Not later than 30 days after the date of any hearing under paragraph (4), the Council shall notify the subject nonbank financial company of the final determination of the Council under this subsection, which shall contain a statement of the basis for the decision of the Council.

    (g) __Consultation__ 

        The Council shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, for each nonbank financial company or subsidiary of a nonbank financial company that is being considered for supervision by the Board of Governors under this section before the Council makes any final determination with respect to such nonbank financial company under subsection (a), (b), or (c).

    (h) __Judicial review__

    (i) __International coordination__ 

        In exercising its duties under this subchapter with respect to foreign nonbank financial companies, foreign-based bank holding companies, and cross-border activities and markets, the Council shall consult with appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, to the extent appropriate.
