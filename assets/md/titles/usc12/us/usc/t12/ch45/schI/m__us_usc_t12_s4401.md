## § 4401. Findings and purpose

The Congress finds that—

    (1) many financial institutions engage daily in thousands of transactions with other financial institutions directly and through clearing organizations;

    (2) the efficient processing of such transactions is essential to a smoothly functioning economy;

    (3) such transactions can be processed most efficiently if, consistent with applicable contractual terms, obligations among financial institutions are netted;

    (4) such netting procedures would reduce the systemic risk within the banking system and financial markets; and

    (5) the effectiveness of such netting procedures can be assured only if they are recognized as valid and legally binding in the event of the closing of a financial institution participating in the netting procedures.
