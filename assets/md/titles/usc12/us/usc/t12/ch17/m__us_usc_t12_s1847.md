The penalty may be assessed and collected by the Board by written notice. As used in the section, the term ‘violates’ includes without any limitation any action (alone or with another or others) for or toward causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or aiding or abetting a violation.

    “(2) In determining the amount of the penalty the Board shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of financial resources and good faith of the company or person charged, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.

    “(3) The company or person assessed shall be afforded an opportunity for agency hearing, upon request made within ten days after issuance of the notice of assessment.

The agency determination shall be made by final order which may be reviewed only as provided in [section 1848 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1848]. If no hearing is requested as herein provided, the assessment shall constitute a final and unappealable order.

    “(4) If any company or person fails to pay an assessment after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Board, the Board shall refer the matter to the Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed by action in the appropriate United States district court. In such action the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.
