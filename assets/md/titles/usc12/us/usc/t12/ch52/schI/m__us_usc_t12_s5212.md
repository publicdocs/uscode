    (a) __Authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the Secretary establishes the program authorized under [section 5211 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5211], then the Secretary shall establish a program to guarantee troubled assets originated or issued prior to March 14, 2008, including mortgage-backed securities.

        (2) __Guarantees__ 

            In establishing any program under this subsection, the Secretary may develop guarantees of troubled assets and the associated premiums for such guarantees. Such guarantees and premiums may be determined by category or class of the troubled assets to be guaranteed.

        (3) __Extent of guarantee__ 

            Upon request of a financial institution, the Secretary may guarantee the timely payment of principal of, and interest on, troubled assets in amounts not to exceed 100 percent of such payments. Such guarantee may be on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Secretary, provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

    (b) __Reports__ 

        Not later than 90 days after October 3, 2008, the Secretary shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the program established under subsection (a).

    (c) __Premiums__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall collect premiums from any financial institution participating in the program established under subsection (a). Such premiums shall be in an amount that the Secretary determines necessary to meet the purposes of this chapter and to provide sufficient reserves pursuant to paragraph (3).

        (2) __Authority to base premiums on product risk__ 

            In establishing any premium under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide for variations in such rates according to the credit risk associated with the particular troubled asset that is being guaranteed. The Secretary shall publish the methodology for setting the premium for a class of troubled assets together with an explanation of the appropriateness of the class of assets for participation in the program established under this section. The methodology shall ensure that the premium is consistent with paragraph (3).

        (3) __Minimum level__ 

            The premiums referred to in paragraph (1) shall be set by the Secretary at a level necessary to create reserves sufficient to meet anticipated claims, based on an actuarial analysis, and to ensure that taxpayers are fully protected.

        (4) __Adjustment to purchase authority__ 

            The purchase authority limit in [section 5225 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5225] shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the total of the outstanding guaranteed obligations and the balance in the Troubled Assets Insurance Financing Fund.
