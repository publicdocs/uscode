([Pub. L. 110–343, div. A, title I, § 116][/us/pl/110/343/s116], Oct. 3, 2008, [122 Stat. 3783][/us/stat/122/3783]; [Pub. L. 111–22, div. A, title VI, § 601][/us/pl/111/22/s601], May 20, 2009, [123 Stat. 1659][/us/stat/123/1659].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b)(2), was in the original “this Act” and was translated as reading “this division”, meaning div. A of [Pub. L. 110–343][/us/pl/110/343], Oct. 3, 2008, [122 Stat. 3765][/us/stat/122/3765], known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. For complete classification of division A to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 5201 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5201] and Tables.

    Section 1204 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enhancement Act of 1989, referred to in subsec. (a)(1)(H), probably means section 1204 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, [Pub. L. 101–73][/us/pl/101/73], which is set out as a note under [section 1811 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1811].

    [Section 1441a of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1441a], referred to in subsec. (a)(1)(H), was repealed by [Pub. L. 111–203, title III, § 364(b)][/us/pl/111/203/s364/b], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 1555][/us/stat/124/1555].

    [Section 5230 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5230], referred to in subsec. (a)(2)(B), was so in the original, but probably should have been a reference to [section 120 of title I of div. A of Pub. L. 110–343][/us/pl/110/343/s120], which is classified to [section 5230 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5230].

 __Amendments__ 

    2009—Subsec. (a)(1)(A)(v). [Pub. L. 111–22, § 601(1)][/us/pl/111/22/s601/1], added cl. (v).

    Subsec. (a)(2). [Pub. L. 111–22, § 601(2)][/us/pl/111/22/s601/2], added subpars. (A) to (E), redesignated former subpar. (C) as (F), and struck out former subpars. (A) and (B) which related to GAO presence and access to records, respectively.
