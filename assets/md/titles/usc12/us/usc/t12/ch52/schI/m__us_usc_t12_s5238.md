        (4) the process used by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in developing accounting standards;

        (5) the advisability and feasibility of modifications to such standards; and

        (6) alternative accounting standards to those provided in such Statement Number 157.

    (b) __Report__ 

        The Securities and Exchange Commission shall submit to Congress a report of such study before the end of the 90-day period beginning on October 3, 2008, containing the findings and determinations of the Commission, including such administrative and legislative recommendations as the Commission determines appropriate.
