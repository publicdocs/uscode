## § 4115. Timetable for approval of plan of action

    (a) __Notification of deficiencies__ 

        Not later than 60 days after receipt of a plan of action, the Secretary shall notify the owner in writing of any deficiencies that prevent the plan of action from being approved. If deficiencies are found, such notice shall describe alternative ways in which the plan may be revised to meet the criteria for approval.

    (b) __Notification of approval__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 180 days after receipt of a plan of action, or such longer period as the owner requests, the Secretary shall notify the owner in writing whether the plan of action, including any revisions, is approved. If approval is withheld, the notice shall describe—

            (A) the reasons for withholding approval; and

            (B) the actions that could be taken to meet the criteria for approval.

        (2) __Opportunity to revise__ 

            The Secretary shall subsequently give the owner a reasonable opportunity to revise the plan of action and seek approval.

    (c) __Delayed approval__ 

        If the Secretary does not approve a plan of action within the period under subsection (b), the Secretary shall provide incentives and assistance under this subchapter in the amount that the owner would have received if the Secretary had complied with such time limitations. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the plan of action was not approved because of deficiencies. An owner may bring an action in the appropriate Federal district court to enforce this subsection.
