## § 4116. Resident homeownership program

    (a) __Formation of resident council__ 

        Tenants seeking to purchase eligible low-income housing in accordance with [section 4110 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4110] shall organize a resident council for the purpose of developing a resident homeownership program in accordance with standards established by the Secretary. The resident council shall work with a public or private nonprofit organization or a public body (including an agency or instrumentality thereof). Such organization or public body shall have experience to enable it to help the tenants consider their options and to develop the capacity necessary to own and manage the housing, where appropriate, and shall be approved by the Secretary.

    (b) __Other program requirements and limitations__ 

        (1) __Sales to residents__ 

        As a condition of approval of a plan of action involving homeownership program under this subchapter, the resident council shall prepare a workable plan acceptable to the Secretary for giving all residents an opportunity to become owners, which plan shall identify—

            (A) the price at which the resident council intends to transfer ownership interests in, or shares representing, units in the housing;

            (B) the factors that will influence the establishment of such price;

            (C) how such price compares to the estimated appraised value of the ownership interests or shares;

            (D) the underwriting standard the resident council plans to use (or reasonably expects a public or private lender to use) for potential tenant purchasers;

            (E) the financing arrangements the tenants are expected to pursue or be provided; and

            (F) a workable schedule of sale (subject to the limitations of paragraph (8)) based on estimated tenant incomes.

        (2) __Approval of method of conversion and limitation on conditions of approval__ 

            The Secretary shall approve the method for converting the housing to homeownership, which may involve acquisition of ownership interests in, or shares representing, the units in a project under any arrangement determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, such as cooperative ownership (including limited equity cooperative ownership) and fee simple ownership (including condominium ownership). The Secretary may not require the prepayment of the mortgage on eligible low-income housing for the approval of a plan of action involving a homeownership program for the housing.

        (3) __Required conditions__ 

        The Secretary shall require that the form of homeownership impose appropriate conditions, including conditions to assure that—

            (A) the number of initial owners that are very low-income, lower income, or moderate-income persons at initial occupancy meet standards required or approved by the Secretary;

            (B) occupancy charges payable by the owners meet requirements established by the Secretary;

            (C) the aggregate incomes of initial and subsequent owners and other sources of funds for the project are sufficient to permit occupancy charges to cover the full operating costs of the housing and any debt service;

            (D) each initial owner occupies the unit it acquires; and

            (E) the low-income affordability restrictions shall continue to apply to any rental units in the housing for any period during which such units remain rental units.

        (4) __Use of proceeds from sales to eligible families__ 

            The entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, may use 50 percent of the proceeds, if any, from the initial sale for costs of the homeownership program, including improvements to the project, operating and replacement reserves for the project, additional homeownership opportunities in the project, and other project-related activities approved by the Secretary. The remaining 50 percent of such proceeds shall be returned to the Secretary for use under [section 4110 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4110], subject to availability under appropriations Acts. Such entity shall keep, and make available to the Secretary, all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Secretary under this paragraph.

        (5) __Restrictions on resale by homeowners__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) __Transfer permitted__ 

                    A homeowner under a homeownership program may transfer the homeowner’s ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit, except that a homeownership program may establish restrictions on the resale of units under the program.

                (ii) __Right to purchase__ 

                    Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or cooperative has jurisdiction over the unit, the corporation, council, or cooperative shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit from the homeowner for the amount specified in a firm contract between the homeowner and a prospective buyer.

                (iii) __Promissory note required__ 

                    The homeowner shall execute a promissory note equal to the difference, if any, between the market value and the purchase price, payable to the Secretary, together with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note.

            (B) __6 years or less__ 

            In the case of a transfer within 6 years of the acquisition under the program, the homeownership program shall provide for appropriate restrictions to assure that an eligible family may not receive any undue profit. The plan shall provide for limiting the family’s consideration for its interest in the property to the total of—

                (i) the contribution to equity paid by the family;

                (ii) the value, as determined by such means as the Secretary shall determine through regulation, of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family’s tenure as owner; and

                (iii) the appreciated value determined by an inflation allowance at a rate which may be based on a cost-of-living index, an income index, or market index as determined by the Secretary through regulation and agreed to by the purchaser and the entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families (or another entity specified in the approved application), at the time of initial sale, and applied against the contribution to equity.

                Such an entity may, at the time of initial sale, enter into an agreement with the family to set a maximum amount which this appreciation may not exceed.

            (C) __6–20 years__ 

                In the case of a transfer during the period beginning 6 years after the acquisition and ending 20 years after the acquisition, the homeownership program shall provide for the recapture by the Secretary or the program of an amount equal to the amount of the declining balance on the note described in subparagraph (A)(iii).

            (D) __Use of recaptured funds__ 

                Any net sales proceeds that may not be retained by the homeowner under the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the unit of general local government in which the housing is located. If the housing is located in a unit of general local government that is not a participating jurisdiction (as such term is defined in [section 12704 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s12704]), any such net sales proceeds shall be paid to the HOME Investment Trust Fund for the State in which the housing is located. With respect to any proceeds transferred to a HOME Investment Trust Fund under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the proceeds shall be immediately available for eligible activities to expand the supply of affordable housing under [section 12742 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s12742]. The Secretary shall require the maintenance of any records necessary to calculate accurately payments due under this paragraph.

        (6) __Protection of nonpurchasing families__ 

            (A) __Eviction__ 

                No tenant residing in a dwelling unit in a property on the date the Secretary approves a plan of action may be evicted by reason of a homeownership program approved under this subchapter.

            (B) __Rental assistance__ 

                If a tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the Secretary shall ensure that rental assistance under [section 1437f of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1437f] is available for use by each otherwise qualified tenant (that meets the eligibility requirements under such section) in that or another property. Any system for preferences established under section 1437f(d)(1)(A) or 1437f(o)(6)(A) of title 42 shall not apply to the provision of assistance to such families.

            (C) __Relocation assistance__ 

                The resident council shall also inform each such tenant that if the tenant chooses to move, the owner will pay relocation assistance in accordance with the approved homeownership program.

        (7) __Qualified management__ 

            As a condition of approval of a homeownership program under this subchapter, the resident council shall have demonstrated its abilities to manage eligible properties by having done so effectively and efficiently for a period of not less than 3 years or by entering into a contract with a qualified management entity that meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe to ensure that the property will be maintained in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.

        (8) __Timely homeownership__ 

            Except in the case of limited equity cooperatives, resident councils shall transfer ownership of the property to tenants within a specified period of time that the Secretary determines to be reasonable. During the interim period when the property continues to be operated and managed as rental housing, the resident council shall utilize written tenant selection policies and criteria that are approved by the Secretary as consistent with the purpose of providing housing for very low-income families. The resident council shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.

        (9) __Records and audit of resident councils__ 

            (A) __Maintenance__ 

                Each resident council shall keep such records as may be reasonably necessary to fully disclose the amount and the disposition by such resident council of the proceeds of assistance received under this subchapter (including any proceeds from sales under paragraphs (4) and (5)(D)), the total cost of the homeownership program in connection with which such assistance is given or used, and the amount and nature of that portion of the program supplied by other sources, and such other sources as will facilitate an effective audit.

            (B) __Access__ 

                The Secretary shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the resident council that are pertinent to assistance received under this subchapter.

            (C) __Audit__ 

                The Comptroller General of the United States, or any of the duly authorized representatives of the Comptroller General, shall also have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the resident council that are pertinent to assistance received under this subchapter.

        (10) __Assumption conditions__ 

            Any entity that assumes a mortgage covering low-income housing in connection with the acquisition of the housing from an owner under this section must comply with any low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the housing as determined under [section 4112(c) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4112/c].

([Pub. L. 100–242, title II][/us/pl/100/242/tII], § 226, as added [Pub. L. 101–625, title VI][/us/pl/101/625/tVI], § 601(a), Nov. 28, 1990, [104 Stat. 4267][/us/stat/104/4267]; amended [Pub. L. 102–550, title III][/us/pl/102/550/tIII], § 309, Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3765][/us/stat/106/3765]; [Pub. L. 105–276, title V][/us/pl/105/276/tV], § 514(b)(2)(A), Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2548][/us/stat/112/2548].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1998—Subsec. (b)(6)(B). [Pub. L. 105–276][/us/pl/105/276], which directed the substitution of “Any system for preferences established under section 1437f(d)(1)(A) or 1437f(o)(6)(A)” for “The requirement for giving preferences to certain categories of eligible families under sections 1437f(d)(1)(A) and 1437f(o)(3)” in second sentence, was executed by making the substitution for text which included the word “preference” rather than “preferences” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1992—Subsec. (b)(2). [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], § 309(1), inserted “and limitation on conditions of approval” in heading and inserted at end of text “The Secretary may not require the prepayment of the mortgage on eligible low-income housing for the approval of a plan of action involving a homeownership program for the housing.”

    Subsec. (b)(3)(E). [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], § 309(2), added subpar. (E).

    Subsec. (b)(8). [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], § 309(3), substituted “Except in the case of limited equity cooperatives, resident” for “Resident”.

    Subsec. (b)(10). [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], § 309(4), struck out “, as determined by the Secretary,” after “entity that assumes”, substituted “4112(c)” for “4112(d)”, and struck out at end “This requirement shall only apply to an entity, such as a cooperative association, that, as determined by the Secretary, intends to own the housing on a permanent basis.”
