## § 4111. Mandatory sale for housing exceeding Federal cost limits

    (a) __In general__ 

        With respect to any eligible low-income housing for which the aggregate preservation rents determined under [section 4104(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4104/b] exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner shall offer the housing for sale to qualified purchasers as provided in this section.

    (b) __Right of first refusal to priority purchasers__ 

        (1) __Duration and required sale__ 

            For the 12-month period beginning upon the receipt by the Secretary of the second notice of intent under [section 4106(d) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4106/d] with respect to such housing, the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to priority purchasers. If, during such period, a priority purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under [section 4103(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4103/b/2], the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.

        (2) __Expression of interest__ 

            During the period under paragraph (1), priority purchasers shall have the opportunity to submit written notice to the owner and the Secretary stating their interest in acquiring the housing. Such written notice shall be in such form and include such information as the Secretary may prescribe.

        (3) __Information from Secretary__ 

            Not later than 30 days after receipt of any notice under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall provide such purchaser with information on the assistance available from the Federal Government to facilitate a transfer and the owner shall provide such purchaser with appropriate information on the housing, as determined by the Secretary.

    (c) __Right of refusal for other qualified purchasers__ 

        If no bona fide offer to purchase any eligible low-income housing subject to this section that meets the requirements of subsection (b) is made during the period under such subsection, during the 3-month period beginning upon the expiration of the 12-month period under subsection (b)(1), the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to qualified purchasers. If, during such period, a qualified purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under [section 4103(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4103/b/2], the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.

    (d) __Assistance__ 

        (1) __Federal cost limit__ 

            Subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, the Secretary shall, for approvable plans of action, provide to qualified purchasers assistance under [section 1437f of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1437f] sufficient to produce a gross income potential equal to the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes), and any other incentives authorized under [section 4109(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4109/b] that would have been provided to a qualified purchaser under [section 4110 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4110].

        (2) __Additional assistance__ 

            From amounts made available under [section 4124(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4124/b], the Secretary may make grants to assist in the completion of sales and transfers under this section to any qualified purchasers. Any grant under this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the preservation value for the housing (determined under [section 4103(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4103/b/2]) and the level of assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection.

        (3) __Securing State and local funding__ 

            The Secretary shall assist any qualified purchaser of such housing in securing funding and other assistance (including tax and assessment reductions) from State and local governments to facilitate a sale under this section.
