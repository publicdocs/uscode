## § 4105. Federal cost limits and limitations on plans of action

    (a) __Determination of relationship to Federal cost limits__ 

        (1) __Initial determination__ 

            For each eligible low-income housing project appraised under [section 4103(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4103/a], the Secretary shall determine whether the aggregate preservation rents for the project determined under paragraph (1) or (2) of [section 4104(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4104/b] exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the fair market rental (established under [section 1437f(c) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1437f/c]) for the market area in which the housing is located by the number of dwelling units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes).

        (2) __Relevant local markets__ 

            If the aggregate preservation rents for a project exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine whether such aggregate rents exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to the appropriate unit sizes). A relevant local market area shall be an area geographically smaller than a market area established by the Secretary under [section 1437f(c)(1) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1437f/c/1] that is identifiable as a distinct rental market area. The Secretary may rely on the appraisal to determine the relevant local market areas and prevailing rents in such local areas and any other information the Secretary determines is appropriate.

        (3) __Effect__ 

            For purposes of this subchapter, the aggregate preservation rents shall be considered to exceed the Federal cost limits under this subsection only if the aggregate preservation rents exceed the amount determined under paragraph (1) and the amount determined under paragraph (2).

    (b) __Limitations on action pursuant to Federal cost limits__ 

        (1) __Housing within Federal cost limits__ 

        If the aggregate preservation rents for an eligible low-income housing project do not exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner may not prepay the mortgage on the housing or terminate the insurance contract with respect to the housing, except as permitted under [section 4114 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4114]. The owner may—

            (A) file a plan of action under [section 4107 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4107] to receive incentives under [section 4109 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4109]; or

            (B) file a second notice of intent under [section 4106(d) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4106/d] indicating an intention to transfer the housing under [section 4110 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4110] and take actions pursuant to such section.

        (2) __Housing exceeding Federal cost limits__ 

        If the aggregate preservation rents for an eligible low-income housing project exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner may—

            (A) file a plan of action under [section 4107 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4107] to receive incentives under [section 4109 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4109] if the owner agrees to accept incentives under such sections in an amount that shall not exceed the Federal cost limit;

            (B) file a second notice of intent under [section 4106(d) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4106/d] indicating an intention to transfer the housing under [section 4110 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4110] and take actions pursuant to such section if the owner agrees to transfer the housing at a price that shall not exceed the Federal cost limit; or

            (C) file a second notice of intent under [section 4106(d) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4106/d] indicating an intention to prepay the mortgage or voluntarily terminate the insurance, subject to the mandatory sale provisions under [section 4111 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4111].

([Pub. L. 100–242, title II, § 215][/us/pl/100/242/s215], as added [Pub. L. 101–625, title VI, § 601(a)][/us/pl/101/625/s601/a], Nov. 28, 1990, [104 Stat. 4252][/us/stat/104/4252]; amended [Pub. L. 102–550, title III, § 317(a)(1)][/us/pl/102/550/s317/a/1], Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3772][/us/stat/106/3772].)

 __Amendments__
