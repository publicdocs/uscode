            (C) __Judicial review__ 

                [Section 1818(h) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1818/h] shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.

        (2) __Factors to be considered__ 

        In determining whether a franchise shall be forfeited under paragraph (1), the Comptroller of the Currency shall take into account the following factors:

            (A) The extent to which directors or senior executive officers of the national bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency knew of, or were involved in, the commission of the money laundering offense of which the bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency was found guilty.

            (B) The extent to which the offense occurred despite the existence of policies and procedures within the national bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency which were designed to prevent the occurrence of any such offense.

            (C) The extent to which the national bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency has fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities with respect to the investigation of the money laundering offense of which the bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency was found guilty.

            (D) The extent to which the national bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency has implemented additional internal controls (since the commission of the offense of which the bank, Federal branch, or Federal agency was found guilty) to prevent the occurrence of any other money laundering offense.

            (E) The extent to which the interest of the local community in having adequate deposit and credit services available would be threatened by the forfeiture of the franchise.

        (3) __Successor liability__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to a successor to the interests of, or a person who acquires, a bank, a Federal branch, or a Federal agency that violated a provision of law described in paragraph (1), if the successor succeeds to the interests of the violator, or the acquisition is made, in good faith and not for purposes of evading this subsection or regulations prescribed under this subsection.

        (4) __“Senior executive officer” defined__ 

            The term “senior executive officer” has the same meaning as in regulations prescribed under [section 1831i(f) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831i/f].

    (d)  __ <sup>\[__  __5__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __5__  __ So in original. Probably should be “(e)”.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Authority__
