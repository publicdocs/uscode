## § 93a. Authority to prescribe rules and regulations

    Except to the extent that authority to issue such rules and regulations has been expressly and exclusively granted to another regulatory agency, the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out the responsibilities of the office, except that the authority conferred by this section does not apply to [section 36 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s36] or to securities activities of National Banks under the Act commonly known as the “Glass-Steagall Act”.

(R.S. § 5239A, as added [Pub. L. 96–221, title VII][/us/pl/96/221/tVII], § 708, Mar. 31, 1980, [94 Stat. 188][/us/stat/94/188].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Glass-Steagall Act, referred to in text, probably refers to [act June 16, 1933, ch. 89][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch89], [48 Stat. 162][/us/stat/48/162], as amended, also known as the Banking Act of 1933 or the Glass-Steagall Act, 1933, rather than to [act Feb. 27, 1932, ch. 58][/us/act/1932-02-27/ch58], [47 Stat. 56][/us/stat/47/56], known as the Glass-Steagall Act, 1932. Section 16 of the 1933 act, which amended section 24 (Seventh) of this title, related in part to securities activities of national banks. For complete classification of these Acts to the Code, see Tables.
