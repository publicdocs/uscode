## § 62. List of shareholders

    The president and cashier of every national banking association shall cause to be kept at all times a full and correct list of the names and residences of all the shareholders in the association, and the number of shares held by each, in the office where its business is transacted. Such list shall be subject to the inspection of all the shareholders and creditors of the association, and the officers authorized to assess taxes under State authority, during business hours of each day in which business may be legally transacted. A copy of such list, verified by the oath of such president or cashier, shall be transmitted to the Comptroller of the Currency within ten days of any demand therefor made by him.

(R.S. § 5210; [May 18, 1953, ch. 59, § 1][/us/act/1953-05-18/ch59/s1], [67 Stat. 27][/us/stat/67/27].)

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 5210 derived from [act June 3, 1864, ch. 106, § 40][/us/act/1864-06-03/ch106/s40], [13 Stat. 111][/us/stat/13/111], which was the National Bank Act. See [section 38 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s38].

 __Amendments__ 

    1953—Act May 18, 1953, changed the requirement for annual transmission of a copy of the shareholders list to the Comptroller of the Currency by authorizing the Comptroller to acquire such copy at any time on 10 days’ notice.

 __Exception as to Transfer of Functions__ 

    Functions vested by any provision of law in Comptroller of the Currency, referred to in this section, not included in transfer of functions to Secretary of the Treasury, see note set out under [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1].

 __Application to District of Columbia__ 

    Provisions of this section were made applicable to banks, etc., in the District of Columbia by [act Mar. 4, 1933, ch. 274, § 4][/us/act/1933-03-04/ch274/s4], [47 Stat. 1567][/us/stat/47/1567].

§§ 63, 64. __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 86–230, § 7__  __][/us/pl/86/230/s7]__  __,__  __Sept. 8, 1959__  __,__  __[__  __73 Stat. 457__  __][/us/stat/73/457]__ 

    Section 63, R.S. § 5151, related to individual liability of shareholders.

    Section 64, [act Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 23][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6/s23], [38 Stat. 273][/us/stat/38/273], related to transfer of shares as affecting individual liability of shareholders. Limitation on liability of shareholders, see [section 64a of this title][/us/usc/t12/s64a].

    The status of former [section 63 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s63] had been doubtful. At different times it had been held to have been repealed, superseded, and superseded only in part by former [section 64 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s64] which related to the same subject. See American T. Co. v. Grut, C.C.A. 1935, 80 F.2d 155; Miller v. Hamner, C.C.A. 1920, 269 F. 891; and First Nat. Bank v. First Nat. Bank, D.C. 1926, 14 F.2d 129.
