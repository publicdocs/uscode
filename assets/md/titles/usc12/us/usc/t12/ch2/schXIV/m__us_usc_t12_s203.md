## § 203. Appointment of conservator

    (a) __Appointment__ 

        The Comptroller of the Currency may, without prior notice or hearings, appoint a conservator (which may be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) to the possession and control of a bank whenever the Comptroller of the Currency determines that 1 or more of the grounds specified in section 11(c)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(5)][/us/usc/t12/s1821/c/5]\] exist.

    (b) __Judicial review__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 20 days after the initial appointment of a conservator pursuant to this section, the bank may bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such bank is located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Comptroller to terminate the appointment of the conservator, and the court, upon the merits, shall dismiss such action or shall direct the Comptroller to terminate the appointment of such conservator. The Comptroller’s decision to appoint a conservator pursuant to this section shall be set aside only if the court finds that such decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

        (2) __Stay__ 

            The conservator may request that any judicial action or proceeding to which the conservator or the bank is or may become a party be stayed for a period of up to 45 days after the appointment of the conservator. Upon petition, the court shall grant such stay as to all parties.

        (3) __Actions and orders__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court may take any action regarding the removal of a conservator, or restrain, or affect the exercise of powers or functions of a conservator. A court, upon application by the Comptroller, shall have jurisdiction to enforce an order of the Comptroller relating to—

            (A) the conservatorship and the bank in conservatorship, or

            (B) restraining or affecting the exercise of powers or functions of a conservator.

    (c) __Additional grounds for appointment__ 

    In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Comptroller may appoint a conservator for a bank if—

        (1) the bank, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors or by an affirmative vote of a majority of its shareholders, consents to such appointment, or

        (2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation terminates the bank’s status as an insured bank.

        The appointment of a conservator pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to review.

    (d) __Exclusive authority__ 

        The Comptroller shall have exclusive power and jurisdiction to appoint a conservator for a bank. Whenever the Comptroller appoints a conservator for any bank, the Comptroller may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation conservator for such bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as such conservator, shall have all the powers granted under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1811][/us/usc/t12/s1811] et seq.\], and (when not inconsistent therewith) any other rights, powers, and privileges possessed by conservators of banks under this Act and any other provision of law. The Comptroller may also appoint another person as conservator, who shall be subject to the provisions of this Act.

    (e) __Replacement of conservator__ 

        The Comptroller may, without notice or hearing, replace a conservator with another conservator. Such replacement shall not affect the bank’s right under subsection (b) to obtain judicial review of the Comptroller’s original decision to appoint a conservator.
