## § 25b. State law preemption standards for national banks and subsidiaries clarified

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

        (1) __National bank__ 

        The term “national bank” includes—

            (A) any bank organized under the laws of the United States; and

            (B) any Federal branch established in accordance with the International Banking Act of 1978 \[[12 U.S.C. 3101][/us/usc/t12/s3101] et seq.\].

        (2) __State consumer financial laws__ 

            The term “State consumer financial law” means a State law that does not directly or indirectly discriminate against national banks and that directly and specifically regulates the manner, content, or terms and conditions of any financial transaction (as may be authorized for national banks to engage in), or any account related thereto, with respect to a consumer.

        (3) __Other definitions__ 

            The terms “affiliate”, “subsidiary”, “includes”, and “including” have the same meanings as in [section 1813 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1813].

    (b) __Preemption standard__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        State consumer financial laws are preempted, only if—

            (A) application of a State consumer financial law would have a discriminatory effect on national banks, in comparison with the effect of the law on a bank chartered by that State;

            (B) in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N. A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25 (1996), the State consumer financial law prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its powers; and any preemption determination under this subparagraph may be made by a court, or by regulation or order of the Comptroller of the Currency on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with applicable law; or

            (C) the State consumer financial law is preempted by a provision of Federal law other than title 62 of the Revised Statutes.

        (2) __Savings clause__ 

            Title 62 of the Revised Statutes and [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s371] do not preempt, annul, or affect the applicability of any State law to any subsidiary or affiliate of a national bank (other than a subsidiary or affiliate that is chartered as a national bank).

        (3) __Case-by-case basis__ 

            (A) __Definition__ 

                As used in this section the term “case-by-case basis” refers to a determination pursuant to this section made by the Comptroller concerning the impact of a particular State consumer financial law on any national bank that is subject to that law, or the law of any other State with substantively equivalent terms.

            (B) __Consultation__ 

                When making a determination on a case-by-case basis that a State consumer financial law of another State has substantively equivalent terms as one that the Comptroller is preempting, the Comptroller shall first consult with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and shall take the views of the Bureau into account when making the determination.

        (4) __Rule of construction__ 

            Title 62 of the Revised Statutes does not occupy the field in any area of State law.

        (5) __Standards of review__ 

            (A) __Preemption__ 

                A court reviewing any determinations made by the Comptroller regarding preemption of a State law by title 62 of the Revised Statutes or [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s371] shall assess the validity of such determinations, depending upon the thoroughness evident in the consideration of the agency, the validity of the reasoning of the agency, the consistency with other valid determinations made by the agency, and other factors which the court finds persuasive and relevant to its decision.

            (B) __Savings clause__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (A), nothing in this section shall affect the deference that a court may afford to the Comptroller in making determinations regarding the meaning or interpretation of title LXII of the Revised Statutes of the United States or other Federal laws.

        (6) __Comptroller determination not delegable__ 

            Any regulation, order, or determination made by the Comptroller of the Currency under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made by the Comptroller, and shall not be delegable to another officer or employee of the Comptroller of the Currency.

    (c) __Substantial evidence__ 

        No regulation or order of the Comptroller of the Currency prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(B), shall be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise declare inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State consumer financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the record of the proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding the preemption of such provision in accordance with the legal standard of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25 (1996).

    (d) __Periodic review of preemption determinations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Comptroller of the Currency shall periodically conduct a review, through notice and public comment, of each determination that a provision of Federal law preempts a State consumer financial law. The agency shall conduct such review within the 5-year period after prescribing or otherwise issuing such determination, and at least once during each 5-year period thereafter. After conducting the review of, and inspecting the comments made on, the determination, the agency shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the decision to continue or rescind the determination or a proposal to amend the determination. Any such notice of a proposal to amend a determination and the subsequent resolution of such proposal shall comply with the procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of [section 43 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s43].

        (2) __Reports to Congress__ 

            At the time of issuing a review conducted under paragraph (1), the Comptroller of the Currency shall submit a report regarding such review to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate. The report submitted to the respective committees shall address whether the agency intends to continue, rescind, or propose to amend any determination that a provision of Federal law preempts a State consumer financial law, and the reasons therefor.

    (e) __Application of State consumer financial law to subsidiaries and affiliates__ 

        Notwithstanding any provision of title 62 of the Revised Statutes or [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s371], a State consumer financial law shall apply to a subsidiary or affiliate of a national bank (other than a subsidiary or affiliate that is chartered as a national bank) to the same extent that the State consumer financial law applies to any person, corporation, or other entity subject to such State law.

    (f) __Preservation of powers related to charging interest__ 

        No provision of title 62 of the Revised Statutes shall be construed as altering or otherwise affecting the authority conferred by [section 85 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s85] for the charging of interest by a national bank at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where the bank is located, including with respect to the meaning of “interest” under such provision.

    (g) __Transparency of OCC preemption determinations__ 

        The Comptroller of the Currency shall publish and update no less frequently than quarterly, a list of preemption determinations by the Comptroller of the Currency then in effect that identifies the activities and practices covered by each determination and the requirements and constraints determined to be preempted.

    (h) __Clarification of law applicable to nondepository institution subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks__ 

        (1) __Definitions__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the terms “depository institution”, “subsidiary”, and “affiliate” have the same meanings as in [section 1813 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1813].

        (2) __Rule of construction__ 

            No provision of title 62 of the Revised Statutes or [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s371] shall be construed as preempting, annulling, or affecting the applicability of State law to any subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of a national bank (other than a subsidiary, affiliate, or agent that is chartered as a national bank).

    (i) __Visitorial powers__ 

        (1)  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. No par. (2) has been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __In general__ 

            In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Cuomo v. Clearing House Assn., L. L. C. (129 S. Ct. 2710 (2009)), no provision of title 62 of the Revised Statutes which relates to visitorial powers or otherwise limits or restricts the visitorial authority to which any national bank is subject shall be construed as limiting or restricting the authority of any attorney general (or other chief law enforcement officer) of any State to bring an action against a national bank in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to enforce an applicable law and to seek relief as authorized by such law.

    (j) __Enforcement actions__ 

        The ability of the Comptroller of the Currency to bring an enforcement action under title 62 of the Revised Statutes or [section 45 of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s45] does not preclude any private party from enforcing rights granted under Federal or State law in the courts.
