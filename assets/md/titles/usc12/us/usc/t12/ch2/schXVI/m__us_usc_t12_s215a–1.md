## § 215a–1. Interstate consolidations and mergers

    (a) __In general__ 

        A national bank may engage in a consolidation or merger under this subchapter with an out-of-State bank if the consolidation or merger is approved pursuant to [section 1831u of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831u].

    (b) __Scope of application__ 

        Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any consolidation or merger before June 1, 1997, unless the home State of each bank involved in the transaction has in effect a law described in [section 1831u(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831u/a/3].

    (c) __Definitions__ 

        The terms “home State” and “out-of-State bank” have the same meaning as in section 1831u(f)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

([Nov. 7, 1918, ch. 209, § 4][/us/act/1918-11-07/ch209/s4], as added [Pub. L. 103–328, title I, § 102(b)(4)(D)][/us/pl/103/328/s102/b/4/D], Sept. 29, 1994, [108 Stat. 2351][/us/stat/108/2351].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1831u of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1831u], referred to in subsec. (c), was subsequently amended, and subsec. (f) of section 1831u no longer defines the terms “home State” and “out-of-State bank”. However, such terms are defined elsewhere in that section.
