    (a) __In general__ 

    The Comptroller of the Currency may, without prior notice or hearings, appoint a receiver for any national bank (and such receiver shall be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if the national bank is an insured bank (as defined in [section 1813(h) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1813/h])) if the Comptroller determines, in the Comptroller’s discretion, that—

        (1) 1 or more of the grounds specified in [section 1821(c)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1821/c/5] exist; or

        (2) the association’s board of directors consists of fewer than 5 members.

    (b) __Judicial review__ 

        If the Comptroller of the Currency appoints a receiver under subsection (a), the national bank may, within 30 days thereafter, bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such bank is located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Comptroller of the Currency to remove the receiver, and the court shall, upon the merits, dismiss such action or direct the Comptroller of the Currency to remove the receiver.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 2 of act June 30, 1876, was classified to [section 65 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s65], prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 86–230][/us/pl/86/230], § 8, Sept. 8, 1959, [73 Stat. 457][/us/stat/73/457].

(a) designation and heading but not the words “The Comptroller of the Currency” which already appeared in text, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–351][/us/pl/109/351], § 701(a)(2), added subsec. (b).

    [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], § 1603(d)(6), amended directory language of [Pub. L. 102–242][/us/pl/102/242], § 133(b). See 1991 Amendment note below.
