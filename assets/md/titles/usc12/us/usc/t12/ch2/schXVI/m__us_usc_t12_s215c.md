        (2) __Extensions of period__ 

        The period for approval or disapproval referred to in paragraph (1) may be extended for an additional 30-day period if the Comptroller of the Currency determines that—

            (B) in the Comptroller’s judgment, any material information submitted is substantially inaccurate or incomplete.

    (c) __Rule of construction__

        For purposes of this section, the term “acquire” means to acquire, directly or indirectly, ownership or control through a merger or consolidation or an acquisition of assets or assumption of liabilities, provided that following such merger, consolidation, or acquisition, an acquiring insured depository institution may not own the shares of the acquired insured depository institution.

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1815(d)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1815/d/3], referred to in subsec. (a), which related to optional conversions by insured depository institutions subject to special rules on deposit insurance payments, was struck out and former section 1815(d)(1)(C) redesignated section 1815(d)(3) by [Pub. L. 109–173][/us/pl/109/173], § 8(a)(4), (5)(D), Feb. 15, 2006, [119 Stat. 3610][/us/stat/119/3610], 3611.

For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see References in Text note set out under [section 38 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s38].

 __Codification__ 

    Section was not enacted as part of [act Nov. 7, 1918, ch. 209][/us/act/1918-11-07/ch209], as added Sept. 8, 1959, [Pub. L. 86–230][/us/pl/86/230], § 20, [73 Stat. 460][/us/stat/73/460], which comprises this subchapter.
