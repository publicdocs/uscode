 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 4747 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4747], referred to in subsec. (c)(2)(A), was in the original “section 237” and was translated as reading “section 257” meaning [section 257 of Pub. L. 103–325][/us/pl/103/325/s257], to reflect the probable intent of Congress. [Pub. L. 103–325][/us/pl/103/325] does not contain a section 237.
