    (a) __In general__ 

    The Director shall make available to the public—

        (1) any written agreement or other written statement for which a violation may be redressed by the Director or any modification to or termination thereof, unless the Director, in the Director’s discretion, determines that public disclosure would be contrary to the public interest or determines under subsection (c) that public disclosure would seriously threaten the financial health or security of the enterprise;

    (b) __Hearings__ 

        All hearings on the record with respect to any action of the Director or notice of charges issued by the Director shall be open to the public, unless the Director, in the Director’s discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest.

    (c) __Delay of public disclosure under exceptional circumstances__ 

        If the Director makes a determination in writing that the public disclosure of any final order pursuant to subsection (a) would seriously threaten the financial health or security of the enterprise, the Director may delay the public disclosure of such order for a reasonable time.

    (d) __Documents filed under seal in public enforcement hearings__ 

        The Director may file any document or part thereof under seal in any hearing under subchapter III if the Director determines in writing that disclosure thereof would be contrary to the public interest.
