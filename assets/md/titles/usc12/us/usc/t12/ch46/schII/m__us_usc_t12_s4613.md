## § 4613. Critical capital levels

    (a) __Enterprises__ 

    For purposes of this subchapter, the critical capital level for each enterprise shall be the sum of—

        (1) 1.25 percent of the aggregate on-balance sheet assets of the enterprise, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

        (2) 0.25 percent of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding mortgage-backed securities and substantially equivalent instruments issued or guaranteed by the enterprise that are not included in paragraph (1); and

        (3) 0.25 percent of other off-balance sheet obligations of the enterprise not included in paragraph (2) (excluding commitments in excess of 50 percent of the average dollar amount of the commitments outstanding each quarter over the preceding 4 quarters), except that the Director shall adjust such percentage to reflect differences in the credit risk of such obligations in relation to the instruments included in paragraph (2).

    (b) __Federal Home Loan Banks__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this subchapter, the critical capital level for each Federal Home Loan Bank shall be such amount of capital as the Director shall, by regulation, require.

        (2) __Consideration of other critical capital levels__ 

            In establishing the critical capital level under paragraph (1) for the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Director shall take due consideration of the critical capital level established under subsection (a) for the enterprises, with such modifications as the Director determines to be appropriate to reflect the difference in operations between the banks and the enterprises.
