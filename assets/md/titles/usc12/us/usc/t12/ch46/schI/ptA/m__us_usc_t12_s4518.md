## § 4518. Prohibition and withholding of executive compensation

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Director shall prohibit the regulated entities from providing compensation to any executive officer of the regulated entity that is not reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses (including other publicly held financial institutions or major financial services companies) involving similar duties and responsibilities.

    (b) __Factors__ 

        In making any determination under subsection (a), the Director may take into consideration any factors the Director considers relevant, including any wrongdoing on the part of the executive officer, and such wrongdoing shall include any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, violation of law, rule, regulation, order, or written agreement, and insider abuse with respect to the regulated entity. The approval of an agreement or contract pursuant to [section 1723a(d)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1723a/d/3/B] or [section 1452(h)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1452/h/2] shall not preclude the Director from making any subsequent determination under subsection (a).

    (c) __Withholding of compensation__ 

        In carrying out subsection (a), the Director may require a regulated entity to withhold any payment, transfer, or disbursement of compensation to an executive officer, or to place such compensation in an escrow account, during the review of the reasonableness and comparability of compensation.

    (d) __Prohibition of setting compensation__ 

        In carrying out subsection (a) of this section, the Director may not prescribe or set a specific level or range of compensation.

    (e) __Authority to regulate or prohibit certain forms of benefits to affiliated parties__ 

        (1) __Golden parachutes and indemnification payments__ 

            The Director may prohibit or limit, by regulation or order, any golden parachute payment or indemnification payment.

        (2) __Factors to be taken into account__ 

        The Director shall prescribe, by regulation, the factors to be considered by the Director in taking any action pursuant to paragraph (1), which may include such factors as—

            (A) whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the affiliated party has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the regulated entity that has had a material effect on the financial condition of the regulated entity;

            (B) whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the affiliated party is substantially responsible for the insolvency of the regulated entity, the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the regulated entity, or the troubled condition of the regulated entity (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Director);

            (C) whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the affiliated party has materially violated any applicable provision of Federal or State law or regulation that has had a material effect on the financial condition of the regulated entity;

            (D) whether the affiliated party was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility; and

            (E)

             the length of time that the party was affiliated with the regulated entity, and the degree to which—

                (i) the payment reasonably reflects compensation earned over the period of employment; and

                (ii) the compensation involved represents a reasonable payment for services rendered.

        (3) __Certain payments prohibited__ 

        No regulated entity may prepay the salary or any liability or legal expense of any affiliated party if such payment is made—

            (A) in contemplation of the insolvency of such regulated entity, or after the commission of an act of insolvency; and

            (B)

             with a view to, or having the result of—

                (i) preventing the proper application of the assets of the regulated entity to creditors; or

                (ii) preferring one creditor over another.

        (4) __Golden parachute payment defined__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “golden parachute payment” means any payment (or any agreement to make any payment) in the nature of compensation by any regulated entity for the benefit of any affiliated party pursuant to an obligation of such regulated entity that—

                (i) is contingent on the termination of such party’s affiliation with the regulated entity; and

                (ii)

                 is received on or after the date on which—

                    (I) the regulated entity became insolvent;

                    (II) any conservator or receiver is appointed for such regulated entity; or

                    (III) the Director determines that the regulated entity is in a troubled condition (as defined in the regulations of the Director).

            (B) __Certain payments in contemplation of an event__ 

                Any payment which would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that such payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be treated as a golden parachute payment if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of such subparagraph.

            (C) __Certain payments not included__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “golden parachute payment” shall not include—

                (i) any payment made pursuant to a retirement plan which is qualified (or is intended to be qualified) under [section 401 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s401], or other nondiscriminatory benefit plan;

                (ii) any payment made pursuant to a bona fide deferred compensation plan or arrangement which the Director determines, by regulation or order, to be permissible; or

        For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:

            (A) __Indemnification payment__ 

            Subject to paragraph (6), the term “indemnification payment” means any payment (or any agreement to make any payment) by any regulated entity for the benefit of any person who is or was an affiliated party, to pay or reimburse such person for any liability or legal expense with regard to any administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Agency which results in a final order under which such person—

                (i) is assessed a civil money penalty;

                (ii) is removed or prohibited from participating in conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity; or

                (iii) is required to take any affirmative action to correct certain conditions resulting from violations or practices, by order of the Director.
