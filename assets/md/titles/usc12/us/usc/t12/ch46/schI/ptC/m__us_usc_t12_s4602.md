        (3) housing affordability and availability and the cost of homeownership;

        (4) the level of secondary mortgage market competition subsequently available in the private sector;

        (5) whether increased amounts of capital would be necessary for the enterprises to continue operation;

        (6) the secondary market for residential loans and the liquidity of such loans; and

        (7) any other factors that the Comptroller General, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Director of the Congressional Budget Office deems appropriate to enable the Congress to evaluate the desirability and feasibility of privatization of the enterprises.

    (c) __Information__ 

        The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation shall provide full and prompt access to the Comptroller General, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to any books, records, and other information requested for the purposes of conducting the studies under this section.

            The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation may each report directly to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on its own analysis of the desirability and feasibility of repealing the Federal charters of the enterprises, eliminating any Federal sponsorship, and allowing the enterprises to continue to operate as fully private entities.
