    (d) __Eliminating interest rate disparities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Upon request by the Director, an enterprise shall provide to the Director, in a form determined by the Director, data the Director may review to determine whether there exist disparities in interest rates charged on mortgages to borrowers who are minorities as compared with comparable mortgages to borrowers of similar creditworthiness who are not minorities.

        (2) __Remedial actions upon preliminary finding__ 

        Upon a preliminary finding by the Director that a pattern of disparities in interest rates with respect to any lender or lenders exists pursuant to the data provided by an enterprise in paragraph (1), the Director shall\_ <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup> 

            (A) refer the preliminary finding to the appropriate regulatory or enforcement agency for further review; and

        (4) __Protection of identity of individuals__
