        The grounds for appointing conservator or receiver for any regulated entity under paragraph (2) are as follows:

            (A) __Assets insufficient for obligations__ 

                The assets of the regulated entity are less than the obligations of the regulated entity to its creditors and others.

            (B) __Substantial dissipation__

                The regulated entity is likely to be unable to pay its obligations or meet the demands of its creditors in the normal course of business.

            (G) __Losses__

            (H) __Violations of law__

                (iv) materially fails to implement a capital restoration plan submitted and accepted under [section 4622 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4622].

            (K) __Critical undercapitalization__ 

                The regulated entity is critically undercapitalized, as defined in [section 4614(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4614/a/4].

                The Attorney General notifies the Director in writing that the regulated entity has been found guilty of a criminal offense under section 1956 or 1957 of title 18 or section 5322 or 5324 of title 31.

        (4) __Mandatory receivership__
