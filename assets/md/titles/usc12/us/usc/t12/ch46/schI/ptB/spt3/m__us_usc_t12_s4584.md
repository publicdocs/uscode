    (a) __Enforcement__

Such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance herewith.

    (b) __Limitation on jurisdiction__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect, by injunction or otherwise, the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order under section 4581 or 4585 of this title, or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order.

([Pub. L. 102–550, title XIII][/us/pl/102/550/tXIII], § 1344, Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3966][/us/stat/106/3966]; [Pub. L. 110–289, div. A, title I][/us/pl/110/289/dA/tI], § 1130(e)(1), July 30, 2008, [122 Stat. 2711][/us/stat/122/2711].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2008—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], which directed substitution of “The Director may bring a civil action” for “The Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring a civil action”, was executed by making the substitution for “The Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
