 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this title”, meaning title XIII of [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3941][/us/stat/106/3941], which is classified principally to this chapter.

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 110–289, § 1158][/us/pl/110/289/s1158], which directed amendment of section “1379B of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 ([12 U.S.C. 4641][/us/usc/t12/s4641])”, was executed to this section, which is section 1379D, formerly section 1379B, of the Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering by [Pub. L. 110–289, § 1153(a)(1)][/us/pl/110/289/s1153/a/1]. See 2008 Amendment notes below.

 __Amendments__

L. 110–289, § 1158(a)(1)(A)][/us/pl/110/289/s1158/a/1/A], in introductory provisions, struck out “administrative” after “with any”, inserted “, examination, or investigation” after “proceeding”, substituted “chapter” for “subchapter”, and inserted “or any designated representative thereof, including any person designated to conduct any hearing under this subchapter” after “Director”.
