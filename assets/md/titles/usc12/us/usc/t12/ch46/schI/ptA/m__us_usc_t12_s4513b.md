## § 4513b. Prudential management and operations standards

    (a) __Standards__ 

    The Director shall establish standards, by regulation or guideline, for each regulated entity relating to—

        (1) adequacy of internal controls and information systems taking into account the nature and scale of business operations;

        (2) independence and adequacy of internal audit systems;

        (3) management of interest rate risk exposure;

        (4) management of market risk, including standards that provide for systems that accurately measure, monitor, and control market risks and, as warranted, that establish limitations on market risk;

        (5) adequacy and maintenance of liquidity and reserves;

        (6) management of asset and investment portfolio growth;

        (7) investments and acquisitions of assets by a regulated entity, to ensure that they are consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the authorizing statutes;

        (8) overall risk management processes, including adequacy of oversight by senior management and the board of directors and of processes and policies to identify, measure, monitor, and control material risks, including reputational risks, and for adequate, well-tested business resumption plans for all major systems with remote site facilities to protect against disruptive events;

        (9) management of credit and counterparty risk, including systems to identify concentrations of credit risk and prudential limits to restrict exposure of the regulated entity to a single counterparty or groups of related counterparties;

        (10) maintenance of adequate records, in accordance with consistent accounting policies and practices that enable the Director to evaluate the financial condition of the regulated entity; and

        (11) such other operational and management standards as the Director determines to be appropriate.

    (b) __Failure to meet standards__ 

        (1) __Plan requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the Director determines that a regulated entity fails to meet any standard established under subsection (a)—

                (i) if such standard is established by regulation, the Director shall require the regulated entity to submit an acceptable plan to the Director within the time allowed under subparagraph (C); and

                (ii) if such standard is established by guideline, the Director may require the regulated entity to submit a plan described in clause (i).

            (B) __Contents__ 

                Any plan required under subparagraph (A) shall specify the actions that the regulated entity will take to correct the deficiency. If the regulated entity is undercapitalized, the plan may be a part of the capital restoration plan for the regulated entity under [section 4622 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4622].

            (C) __Deadlines for submission and review__ 

            The Director shall by regulation establish deadlines that—

                (i) provide the regulated entities with reasonable time to submit plans required under subparagraph (A), and generally require a regulated entity to submit a plan not later than 30 days after the Director determines that the entity fails to meet any standard established under subsection (a); and

                (ii) require the Director to act on plans expeditiously, and generally not later than 30 days after the plan is submitted.

        (2) __Required order upon failure to submit or implement plan__ 

        If a regulated entity fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed under paragraph (1)(C), or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the Director, the following shall apply:

            (A) __Required correction of deficiency__ 

                The Director shall, by order, require the regulated entity to correct the deficiency.

            (B) __Other authority__ 

            The Director may, by order, take one or more of the following actions until the deficiency is corrected:

                (i) Prohibit the regulated entity from permitting its average total assets (as such term is defined in [section 4516(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4516/b]) during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter, or restrict the rate at which the average total assets of the entity may increase from one calendar quarter to another.

                (ii)

                 Require the regulated entity—

                    (I) in the case of an enterprise, to increase its ratio of core capital to assets.

                    (II) in the case of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to increase its ratio of total capital (as such term is defined in [section 1426(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1426/a/5]) to assets.

                (iii) Require the regulated entity to take any other action that the Director determines will better carry out the purposes of this section than any of the actions described in this subparagraph.

        (3) __Mandatory restrictions__ 

        In complying with paragraph (2), the Director shall take one or more of the actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) if—

            (A) the Director determines that the regulated entity fails to meet any standard prescribed under subsection (a);

            (B) the regulated entity has not corrected the deficiency; and

            (C) during the 18-month period before the date on which the regulated entity first failed to meet the standard, the entity underwent extraordinary growth, as defined by the Director.

    (c) __Other enforcement authority not affected__ 

        The authority of the Director under this section is in addition to any other authority of the Director.
