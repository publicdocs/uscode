        (3) __Distribution to States by needs-based formula__

            (B) __Basis for formula__ 

            The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:

                (i) The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in all the States.

                (iii) The ratio of extremely low-income renter households in the State living with either (I) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (II) more than 1 person per room, or (III) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs, to the aggregate number of extremely low-income renter households living with either (IV) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (V) more than 1 person per room, or (VI) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs in all the States.

                    (I) means the cost of construction or building rehabilitation in the State relative to the national cost of construction or building rehabilitation; and

                    (II) shall be calculated such that values higher than 1.0 indicate that the State’s construction costs are higher than the national average, a value of 1.0 indicates that the State’s construction costs are exactly the same as the national average, and values lower than 1.0 indicate that the State’s cost of construction are lower than the national average.

            (C) __Priority__ 

                The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall give priority emphasis and consideration to the factor described in subparagraph (B)(i).

        (4) __Allocation of grant amounts__

            (C) __Minimum State allocations__ 

                If the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year would allocate less than $3,000,000 to any of the 50 States of the United States or the District of Columbia, the allocation for such State of the United States or the District of Columbia shall be $3,000,000, and the increase shall be deducted pro rata from the allocations made to all other of the States (as such term is defined in [section 4502 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4502]).
