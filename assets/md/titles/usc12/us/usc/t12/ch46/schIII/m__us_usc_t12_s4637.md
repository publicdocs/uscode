 __Amendments__ 

    2008—[Pub. L. 110–289, § 1157(4)][/us/pl/110/289/s1157/4], which directed the substitution of “regulated entity.” for “enterprise.” could not be executed because of the prior amendment by [Pub. L. 110–289, § 1156(b)(1)][/us/pl/110/289/s1156/b/1]. See below.

    [Pub. L. 110–289, § 1157(3)][/us/pl/110/289/s1157/3], which directed the substitution of “entity-affiliated party” for “director or officer” wherever appearing, was executed by making the substitution for “director or executive officer” in two places, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

L. 110–289, § 1156(b)(1)][/us/pl/110/289/s1156/b/1]. See below.
