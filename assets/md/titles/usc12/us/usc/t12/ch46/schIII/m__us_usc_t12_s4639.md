        (3) any modification to or termination of any final order made public pursuant to this subsection.

    (b) __Hearings__ 

        All hearings on the record with respect to any notice of charges issued by the Director shall be open to the public, unless the Director, in the Director’s discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest.

    (c) __Delay of public disclosure under exceptional circumstances__ 

        If the Director makes a determination in writing that the public disclosure of any final order pursuant to subsection (a) would seriously threaten the financial health or security of the regulated entity, the Director may delay the public disclosure of such order for a reasonable time.

    (d) __Documents filed under seal in public enforcement hearings__ 

        The Director may file any document or part thereof under seal in any hearing commenced by the Director if the Director determines in writing that disclosure thereof would be contrary to the public interest.
