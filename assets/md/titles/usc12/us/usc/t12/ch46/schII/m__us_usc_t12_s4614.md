## § 4614. Capital classifications

    (a) __Enterprises__ 

    For purposes of this subchapter, the Director shall classify the enterprises according to the following capital classifications:

        (1) __Adequately capitalized__ 

        An enterprise shall be classified as adequately capitalized if the enterprise—

            (A) maintains an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise under [section 4611 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4611]; and

            (B) maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise under [section 4612 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4612].

        (2) __Undercapitalized__ 

        An enterprise shall be classified as undercapitalized if—

            (A)

             the enterprise—

                (i) does not maintain an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise; and

                (ii) maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise; or

            (B) the enterprise is otherwise classified as undercapitalized under subsection (b)(1) of this section.

        (3) __Significantly undercapitalized__ 

        An enterprise shall be classified as significantly undercapitalized if—

            (A)

             the enterprise—

                (i) does not maintain an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise;

                (ii) does not maintain an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level established for the enterprise; and

                (iii) maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the critical capital level established for the enterprise under [section 4613 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4613]; or

            (B) the enterprise is otherwise classified as significantly undercapitalized under subsection (b)(2) of this section or [section 4615(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4615/b].

        (4) __Critically undercapitalized__ 

        An enterprise shall be classified as critically undercapitalized if—

            (A)

             the enterprise—

                (i) does not maintain an amount of total capital that is equal to or exceeds the risk-based capital level established for the enterprise; and

                (ii) does not maintain an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the critical capital level for the enterprise; or

            (B) is otherwise classified as critically undercapitalized under subsection (b)(3) of this section or section 4616(b)(5)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

    (b) __Federal Home Loan Banks__ 

        (1) __Establishment and criteria__ 

        For purposes of this subchapter, the Director shall, by regulation—

            (A) establish the capital classifications specified under paragraph (2) for the Federal Home Loan Banks;

            (B) establish criteria for each such capital classification based on the amount and types of capital held by a bank and the risk-based, minimum, and critical capital levels for the banks and taking due consideration of the capital classifications established under subsection (a) for the enterprises, with such modifications as the Director determines to be appropriate to reflect the difference in operations between the banks and the enterprises; and

            (C) shall classify the Federal Home Loan Banks according to such capital classifications.

        (2) __Classifications__ 

        The capital classifications specified under this paragraph are—

            (A) adequately capitalized;

            (B) undercapitalized;

            (C) significantly undercapitalized; and

            (D) critically undercapitalized.

    (c) __Discretionary classification__ 

        (1) __Grounds for reclassification__ 

        The Director may reclassify a regulated entity under paragraph (2) if—

            (A) at any time, the Director determines in writing that the regulated entity is engaging in conduct that could result in a rapid depletion of core or total capital or the value of collateral pledged as security has decreased significantly or that the value of the property subject to mortgages held by the regulated entity (or securitized in the case of an enterprise) has decreased significantly;

            (B) after notice and an opportunity for hearing, the Director determines that the regulated entity is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or

            (C) pursuant to [section 4631(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4631/b], the Director deems the regulated entity to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.

        (2) __Reclassification__ 

        In addition to any other action authorized under this chapter, including the reclassification of a regulated entity for any reason not specified in this subsection, if the Director takes any action described in paragraph (1), the Director may classify a regulated entity—

            (A) as undercapitalized, if the regulated entity is otherwise classified as adequately capitalized;

            (B) as significantly undercapitalized, if the regulated entity is otherwise classified as undercapitalized; and

            (C) as critically undercapitalized, if the regulated entity is otherwise classified as significantly undercapitalized.

    (d) __Quarterly determination__ 

        The Director shall determine the capital classification of the regulated entities for purposes of this subchapter on not less than a quarterly basis (and as appropriate under subsection (c)).

    (e) __Restriction on capital distributions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A regulated entity shall make no capital distribution if, after making the distribution, the regulated entity would be undercapitalized.

        (2) __Exception__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Director may permit a regulated entity, to the extent appropriate or applicable, to repurchase, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire shares or ownership interests if the repurchase, redemption, retirement, or other acquisition—

            (A) is made in connection with the issuance of additional shares or obligations of the regulated entity in at least an equivalent amount; and

            (B) will reduce the financial obligations of the regulated entity or otherwise improve the financial condition of the entity.

    (f) __Implementation__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, during the period beginning on October 28, 1992, and ending upon the effective date of [section 4615 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4615] (as provided in section 4615(c) 1 of this title), an enterprise shall be classified as adequately capitalized if the enterprise maintains an amount of core capital that is equal to or exceeds the minimum capital level for the enterprise under [section 4612 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4612].

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 4616(b)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4616/b/5], referred to in subsec. (a)(4)(B), was redesignated [section 4616(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4616/b/6] by [Pub. L. 110–289, div. A, title I][/us/pl/110/289/dA/tI], § 1144(5)(D), July 30, 2008, [122 Stat. 2733][/us/stat/122/2733].

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), was in the original “this title”, meaning title XIII of [Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550], Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3941][/us/stat/106/3941], which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title XIII to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 4501 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4501] and Tables.

    [Section 4615(c) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4615/c], referred to in subsec. (f), was repealed and a new section 4615(c) was added by [Pub. L. 110–289, div. A, title I][/us/pl/110/289/dA/tI], § 1143(6), July 30, 2008, [122 Stat. 2734][/us/stat/122/2734]. The new section 4615(c) does not relate to effective date.

 __Amendments__ 

    2008—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(1), substituted “Enterprises” for “In general” in heading.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(4), added subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which related to discretionary classification.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1161(a)(3), which directed amendment of subsec. (c) by striking out the last sentence, was not executed as the probable intent of Congress. The amendment was probably intended to strike out the last sentence of former subsec. (c), now subsec. (d), as it existed prior to being struck out by [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(2)(C). See below.

    [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(3), (4), added subsec. (c) and redesignated former subsec. (c) as (d).

    [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(2)(C), struck out last sentence which read as follows: “The first such determination shall be made during the 3-month period beginning on the appointment of the Director.”

    [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(2)(A), (B), substituted “regulated entities” for “enterprises” and “subsection (c)” for “subsection (b)”.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(3), redesignated subsec. (c) as (d). Former subsec. (d) redesignated (f).

    Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(5), added subsec. (e).

    Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289], § 1142(a)(3), redesignated subsec. (d) as (f).
