## § 4563. Multifamily special affordable housing goal

    (a) __Establishment of goal__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Director shall, by regulation, establish a single annual goal, by either unit or dollar volume, of purchases by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to low-income families.

        (2) __Additional requirements for units affordable to very low-income families__ 

            When establishing the goal under this section, the Director shall establish additional requirements for the purchase by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-income families.

        (3) __Reporting on smaller properties__ 

            The Director shall require each enterprise to report on the purchase by each enterprise of multifamily housing of a smaller or limited size that is affordable to low-income families, which may be based on multifamily projects of 5 to 50 units (as such numbers may be adjusted by the Director) or on mortgages of up to $5,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted by the Director), and may, by regulation, establish such aditional  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  requirements related to such units.

        (4) __Factors__ 

        In establishing the goal and additional requirements under this section, the Director shall not consider segments of the market determined to be inconsistent with safety and soundness or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, and shall take into consideration—

            (A) national multifamily mortgage credit needs and the ability of the enterprise to provide additional liquidity and stability for the multifamily mortgage market;

            (B) the performance and effort of the enterprise in making mortgage credit available for multifamily housing in previous years;

            (C) the size of the multifamily mortgage market for housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families, including the size of the multifamily markets for housing of a smaller or limited size;

            (D) the ability of the enterprise to lead the market in making multifamily mortgage credit available, especially for multifamily housing described in paragraphs (1) and (2);

            (E) the availability of public subsidies; and

            (F) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprise.

    (b) __Units financed by housing finance agency bonds__ 

    The Director shall give full credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section (for purposes of [section 4566 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4566]) to dwelling units in multifamily housing that otherwise qualifies under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in whole or in part—

        (1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or

        (2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the Director may give less than full credit for purchases of investment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.

    (c) __Measurement of performance__ 

        The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of [section 4566 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4566]) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.

    (d) __Determination of compliance__ 

        The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to [section 4561(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s4561/a], whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).
