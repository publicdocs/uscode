## § 2252. Powers and duties

    (a) __Enumerated powers__ 

    The Farm Credit Administration shall have the following powers, functions, and responsibilities in connection with the institutions of the Farm Credit System and the administration of this chapter:

        (1) Modify the boundaries of farm credit districts, with due regard for the farm credit needs of the country, as approved by the Board, with the concurrence of the district banks involved.

        (2) Where necessary or appropriate to carry out the policy and objectives of this chapter, issue and approve amendments to Federal charters of institutions of the System; approve change in names of banks operating under this chapter; approve the merger of districts when agreed to by the district bank boards involved and by a majority vote of the voting stockholders and contributors to the guaranty funds of each bank for each of such districts, voting in the same manner as is provided in [section 2279a of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2279a]; approve mergers and any related activities as provided for in subchapter VII of this chapter; and approve the consolidation or division of the territories of institutions when agreed to by a majority vote of the voting stockholders or contributors to the guaranty fund of each of the institutions involved; and approve consolidations of boards of directors when agreed to by a majority vote of the voting stockholders or contributors to the guaranty fund of each of the institutions involved. In issuing charters and certificates of territory for district-wide mergers of associations where stockholders of one or more associations did not approve the merger, the charter of the new or merged association shall not include the territory of the disagreeing association or associations; charters issued during calendar year 1985 for district-wide new or merged associations which included the territory of a disagreeing association shall be revoked and reissued to exclude such territory, unless subsequently agreed to by the board of directors of such association or associations. The Farm Credit Administration Board shall ensure that disapproving associations (A) shall not be charged any assessment under this chapter at a rate higher than that charged other like associations in the district, and (B) shall be provided with financial services and assistance on the same basis as other like associations in the district (including, but not limited to, access to credit and rates of interest on loans and discounts) by a district Farm Credit bank to the association and its member-borrowers. The Farm Credit Administration Board, after consultation with the respective boards of directors of the affected banks, may require two or more banks operating under the same or different titles to merge if the Board determines that one of such banks has failed to meet its outstanding obligations.

        (3) Make annual reports directly to Congress on the condition of the System and its institutions, based on the examinations carried out under [section 2254 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2254], and on the manner and extent to which the purposes and objectives of this chapter are being carried out and, from time to time, recommend directly legislative changes. The annual reports shall include a summary and analysis of the reports submitted to the Farm Credit Administration by the Farm Credit Banks under [section 2207(b) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2207/b] relating to programs for serving young, beginning, and small farmers and ranchers.

        (4) Approve the issuance of obligations of the System under subsections (c) and (d) of [section 2153 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2153] for the purpose of funding the authorized operations of the institutions of the System, and prescribe collateral therefor.

        (5) Grant approvals provided for under this chapter either on a case-by-case basis or through regulations that confer approval on actions of Farm Credit System institutions.

        (6) Establish standards for the System institutions with respect to loan security requirements and regulate the borrowing, repayment, and transfer of funds and equities between institutions of the System.

        (7) Conduct loan and collateral security review.

        (8)

         Regulate the preparation by System institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and investors of information on the financial condition and operations of such institutions, except that the requirements of the Farm Credit Administration governing the dissemination to stockholders of quarterly reports of System institutions may not be more burdensome or costly than the requirements applicable to national banks, and the Farm Credit Administration may not require any System institution to disclose in any report to stockholders information concerning the condition or classification of a loan—
