## § 2184. Communications with stockholders

    (a) __Provision of stockholder lists__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Within 7 days after receipt of a written request by a stockholder, a bank for cooperatives, Federal land bank association, or production credit association shall provide a current list of its stockholders to such requesting stockholder.

        (2) __Conditions__ 

        As a condition of providing a stockholder list under paragraph (1), the bank or association may require that the stockholder agree and certify in writing that the stockholder will—

            (A) use the list exclusively for communicating with stockholders for permissible purposes; and

            (B) not make the list available to any person, other than the stockholder’s attorney or accountant, without first obtaining the written consent of the institution.

    (b) __Alternative communications__ 

        (1) __Request to issue__ 

            As an alternative to receiving a list of stockholders, a stockholder may request the institution to mail or otherwise furnish to each stockholder a communication for a permissible purpose on behalf of the requesting stockholder.

        (2) __When permissible__ 

            Alternative communications may be used, at the discretion of the requesting stockholder, if the requester agrees to defray the reasonable costs of the communication. If the requester decides to exercise this option, the institution shall provide the requester with a written estimate of the costs of handling and mailing the communication as soon as is practicable after receipt of the stockholder’s request to furnish the communication.
