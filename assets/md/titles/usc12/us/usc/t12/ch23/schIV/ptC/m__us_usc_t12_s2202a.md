            (B) The loan is delinquent or past due under the terms of the loan contract.

            (C) One or both of the factors listed in subparagraphs (A) and (B), together with inadequate collateralization, present a high probability of loss to the lender.

        (4) __Foreclosure proceeding__

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the term “loan” means a loan made to a farmer, rancher, or producer or harvester of aquatic products, for any agricultural or aquatic purpose and other credit needs of the borrower, including financing for basic processing and marketing directly related to the borrower’s operations and those of other eligible farmers, ranchers, and producers or harvesters of aquatic products.

            (B) __Exclusion for loans designated for sale into secondary market__ 

                (i) __In general__

                (ii) __Unsold loans__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Except as provided in subclause (II), if a loan designated for sale under clause (i) is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of the designation, the provisions of this section and sections 2202, 2202b, 2202c, 2202d, and 2219a of this title that would otherwise apply to the loan in the absence of the exclusion described in clause (i) shall become effective with respect to the loan.

        (7) __Restructure and restructuring__ 

            The terms “restructure” and “restructuring” include rescheduling, reamortization, renewal, deferral of principal or interest, monetary concessions, and the taking of any other action to modify the terms of, or forbear on, a loan in any way that will make it probable that the operations of the borrower will become financially viable.

    (b) __Notice__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        On a determination by a qualified lender that a loan made by the lender is or has become a distressed loan, the lender shall provide written notice to the borrower that the loan may be suitable for restructuring, and include with such notice—

            (A) a copy of the policy of the lender established under subsection (g) that governs the treatment of distressed loans; and

            (B) all materials necessary to enable the borrower to submit an application for restructuring on the loan.

        (2) __Notice before foreclosure__ 

            Not later than 45 days before any qualified lender begins foreclosure proceedings with respect to a loan outstanding to any borrower, the lender shall notify the borrower that the loan may be suitable for restructuring and that the lender will review any such suitable loan for restructuring, and shall include with such notice a copy of the policy and the materials described in paragraph (1).

        (3) __Limitation on foreclosure__ 

            No qualified lender may foreclose or continue any foreclosure proceeding with respect to any distressed loan before the lender has completed any pending consideration of the loan for restructuring under this section.

    (c) __Meetings__ 

    On determination by a qualified lender that a loan made by the lender is or has become a distressed loan, the lender shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the borrower thereof to personally meet with a representative of the lender—

        (1) to review the status of the loan, the financial condition of the borrower, and the suitability of the loan for restructuring; and

        (2) with respect to a loan that is in nonaccrual status, to develop a plan for restructuring the loan if the loan is suitable for restructuring.

    (d) __Consideration of applications__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        When a qualified lender receives an application for restructuring from a borrower, the qualified lender shall determine whether or not to restructure the loan, taking into consideration—

            (A) whether the cost to the lender of restructuring the loan is equal to or less than the cost of foreclosure;

            (B) whether the borrower is applying all income over and above necessary and reasonable living and operating expenses to the payment of primary obligations;

            (C) whether the borrower has the financial capacity and the management skills to protect the collateral from diversion, dissipation, or deterioration;

            (D) whether the borrower is capable of working out existing financial difficulties, reestablishing a viable operation, and repaying the loan on a rescheduled basis; and

            (E) in the case of a distressed loan that is not delinquent, whether restructuring consistent with sound lending practices may be taken to reasonably ensure that the loan will not become a loan that it is necessary to place in nonaccrual status.

        (2) __Applications not required for restructuring plans__ 

            This section shall not prevent a qualified lender from proposing a restructuring plan for an individual borrower in the absence of an application for restructuring from the borrower.

    (e) __Restructuring__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If a qualified lender determines that the potential cost to such qualified lender of restructuring the loan in accordance with a proposed restructuring plan is less than or equal to the potential cost of foreclosure, the qualified lender shall restructure the loan in accordance with the plan.

        (2) __Computation of cost of restructuring__ 

        In determining whether the potential cost to the qualified lender of restructuring a distressed loan is less than or equal to the potential cost of foreclosure, a qualified lender shall consider all relevant factors, including—

            (A) the present value of interest income and principal forgone by the lender in carrying out the restructuring plan;

            (B) reasonable and necessary administrative expenses involved in working with the borrower to finalize and implement the restructuring plan;

            (C) whether the borrower has presented a preliminary restructuring plan and cash-flow analysis taking into account income from all sources to be applied to the debt and all assets to be pledged, showing a reasonable probability that orderly debt retirement will occur as a result of the proposed restructuring; and

            (D) whether the borrower has furnished or is willing to furnish complete and current financial statements in a form acceptable to the institution.

    (f) __Least cost alternative__ 

        If two or more restructuring alternatives are available to a qualified lender under this section with respect to a distressed loan, the lender shall restructure the loan in conformity with the alternative that results in the least cost to the lender.

    (g) __Restructuring policy__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            Each bank board of directors shall develop a policy within 60 days after January 6, 1988, that is consistent with this section, to govern the restructuring of distressed loans. Such policy shall constitute the restructuring policy of each qualified lender within the district.

        (2) __Contents of policy__ 

        The policy established under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of—

            (A) the procedure for submitting an application for restructuring; and

            (B) the right of borrowers with distressed loans to seek review by a credit review committee in accordance with [section 2202 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2202] of a denial of an application for restructuring.

        (3) __Submission of policy to FCA__ 

            Each bank board shall submit the policy of the district governing the treatment of distressed loans under this section to the Farm Credit Administration.

    During the 5-year period beginning on January 6, 1988, each qualified lender shall submit semiannual reports to the Farm Credit Administration containing—

        (1) the results of the review of distressed loans of the lender; and

        (2) the financial effect of loan restructurings and liquidations on the lender.

    (i) __Compliance__ 

        The Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive requiring compliance with any provision of this section to any qualified lender that fails to comply with such provision.

    (j) __Permitted foreclosures__ 

        This section shall not be construed to prevent any qualified lender from enforcing any contractual provision that allows the lender to foreclose a loan, or from taking such other lawful action as the lender deems appropriate, if the lender has reasonable grounds to believe that the loan collateral will be destroyed, dissipated, consumed, concealed, or permanently removed from the State in which the collateral is located.

    (k) __Application of section__ 

        The time limitation prescribed in subsection (b)(2), and the requirements of subsection (c), shall not apply to a loan that became a distressed loan before January 6, 1988, if the borrower and lender of the loan are in the process of negotiating loan restructuring with respect to the loan.
