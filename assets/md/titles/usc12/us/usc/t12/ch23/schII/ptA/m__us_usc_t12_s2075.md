## § 2075. Short- and intermediate-term loans; participation; other financial assistance; terms; conditions; interest; security

    (a) __Short- and intermediate-term loans__ 

    Each production credit association, under standards prescribed by the board of directors of the Farm Credit Bank of the district, may make, guarantee, or participate with other lenders in short- and intermediate-term loans and other similar financial assistance to—

        (1) bona fide farmers and ranchers and the producers or harvesters of aquatic products, for agricultural or aquatic purposes and other requirements of such borrowers, including financing for basic processing and marketing directly related to the operations of the borrower and those of other eligible farmers, ranchers, and producers or harvesters of aquatic products, except that the operations of the borrower shall supply some portion of the total processing or marketing for which financing is extended, except that the aggregate of the financing provided by any association for basic processing and marketing directly related to the operations of farmers, ranchers, and producers or harvesters of aquatic products, if the operations of the applicant supply less than 20 percent of the total processing or marketing for which financing is extended, shall not exceed 15 percent of the total of all outstanding loans of all associations in the district at the end of its preceding fiscal year;

        (2) rural residents for housing financing in rural areas, under regulations of the Farm Credit Administration; and

        (3) persons furnishing to farmers and ranchers farm-related services directly related to their on-farm operating needs.

    (b) __Rural housing__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Rural housing financed under this part shall be for single-family, moderate-priced dwellings and the appurtenances of such not inconsistent with the general quality and standards of housing existing in, or planned or recommended for, the rural area where it is located.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            The aggregate of such housing loans in an association to persons other than farmers or ranchers shall not exceed 15 percent of the outstanding loans at the end of its preceding fiscal year except on prior approval by the Farm Credit Bank of the district. The aggregate of such housing loans in any farm credit district shall not exceed 15 percent of the outstanding loans of all associations in the district at the end of the preceding fiscal year.

        (3) __Rural areas__ 

            For rural housing purposes under this section the term “rural areas” shall not be defined to include any city or village having a population in excess of 2,500 inhabitants.

        (4) __Equipment__ 

            Each association may own and lease, or lease with option to purchase, to stockholders of the association equipment needed in the operations of the stockholder.

    (c) __Interest rates and charges__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Loans authorized in subsection (a) shall bear such rate or rates of interest as are determined under standards prescribed by the board of the bank subject to the provisions of [section 2205 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s2205], and shall be made upon such terms, conditions, and upon such security, if any, as shall be authorized in such standards.

        (2) __Setting of rates__ 

            In setting rates and charges, it shall be the objective to provide the types of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the association, necessary reserves and expenses of the association, and services provided to borrowers and members.

        (3) __Varying rates__ 

            The loan documents may provide for the interest rate or rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rate or rates currently being charged by the association.

        (4) __Prior approval__ 

            Such standards may require prior approval of the bank on certain classes of loans, and may authorize a continuing commitment to a borrower of a line of credit.

    (d) __Special district rule__ 

        (1) __Provision of credit and technical assistance outside service territory__ 

            Notwithstanding any territorial limitation in the charter of a production credit association located in a district in which there are only two such associations, the Farm Credit Administration Board, on request of such association, may permit such association to provide credit and technical assistance to any borrower who is denied credit by the other production credit association in the district if the Board determines that such other production credit association in the district is unduly restrictive in the application of credit standards.

        (2) __Timing of determination__ 

            If the Farm Credit Administration Board approves the extension of credit and technical assistance under paragraph (1), the association shall approve or deny the application for credit within 90 days after receipt of the application from the borrower.
