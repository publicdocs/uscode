## § 2277a–4. Premiums

    (a) __Amount in Fund not exceeding secure base amount__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If at the end of any calendar year the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund does not exceed the secure base amount, subject to paragraph (3), the premium due from any insured System bank for the calendar year shall be equal to the sum of—

            (A) the average outstanding insured obligations issued by the bank for the calendar year, after deducting from the obligations the percentages of the guaranteed portions of loans and investments described in paragraph (2), multiplied by 0.0020; and

            (B)

             the product obtained by multiplying—

                (i)

                 the sum of—

                    (I) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on loans made by the bank that are in nonaccrual status; and

                    (II) the average amount outstanding for the calendar year of other-than-temporarily impaired investments made by the bank; by

                (ii) 0.0010.

        (2) __Deductions from average outstanding insured obligations__ 

        The average outstanding insured obligations issued by the bank for the calendar year referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall be reduced by deducting from the obligations the sum of (as determined by the Corporation)—

            (A)

             90 percent of each of—

                (i) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on the guaranteed portions of Federal government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status; and

                (ii) the average amount outstanding for the calendar year of the guaranteed portions of Federal government-guaranteed investments made by the bank that are not permanently impaired; and

            (B)

             80 percent of each of—

                (i) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on the guaranteed portions of State government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status; and

                (ii) the average amount outstanding for the calendar year of the guaranteed portions of State government-guaranteed investments made by the bank that are not permanently impaired.

        (3) __Reduced premiums__ 

            The Corporation, in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may reduce by a percentage uniformly applied to all insured System banks the premium due from each insured System bank during any calendar year, as determined under paragraph (1).

        (4) __Definition of government-guaranteed loans or investments__ 

        In this section, the term “government-guaranteed”, when applied to a loan or an investment, means a loan, credit, or investment, or portion of a loan, credit, or investment, that is guaranteed—

            (A) by the full faith and credit of the United States Government or any State government;

            (B) by an agency or other entity of the United States Government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by the United States Government; or

            (C) by an agency or other entity of a State government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by such State government.

    (b) __Amount in Fund exceeding secure base amount__ 

        At any time the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall reduce the premium due from each insured System bank, as determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section, by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all System banks is sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund after such premiums are paid is not less than the secure base amount at such time.

    (c) __Secure base amount__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this part, the term “secure base amount” means, with respect to any point in time, 2 percent of the aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks at such time (as adjusted under paragraph (2)), or such other percentage of the aggregate amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion determines is actuarially sound to maintain in the Insurance Fund taking into account the risk of insuring outstanding insured obligations.

        (2) __Adjustment__ 

        The aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks under paragraph (1) shall be adjusted downward to exclude an amount equal to the sum of (as determined by the corporation)—

    (d) __Determination of loan and investment amounts__

        (4) __Allocation formula__ 

        From the total amount required to be allocated at the end of a calendar year under paragraph (3)—

            (A) 10 percent of the total amount shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B), subject to paragraph (6)(C); and

            (B)

             there shall be credited to the allocated insurance reserves account  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

                (ii) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on insured obligations issued by all insured System banks (after deducting from the principal the percentages of the guaranteed portions of loans and investments described in subsection (a)(2)).

        (5) __Use of funds in Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts__ 

        To the extent that the sum of the operating expenses of the Corporation and the insurance obligations of the Corporation for a calendar year exceeds the sum of operating expenses and insurance obligations determined under paragraph (3) for the calendar year, the Corporation shall cover the expenses and obligations by—

            (A) reducing each Allocated Insurance Reserves Account by the same proportion; and

            (B) expending the amounts obtained under subparagraph (A) before expending other amounts in the Fund.

            (A) __In general__ 

            As soon as practicable during each calendar year, the Corporation may—

                (ii) subject to subparagraphs (C) and (E), pay to each System bank and association holding Financial Assistance Corporation stock a proportionate share, determined by dividing the number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock held by the institution by the total number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock outstanding at the time of the termination of the Financial Assistance Corporation, of the balance in the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B).

            (B) __Authority to eliminate or reduce payments__ 

                The Corporation may eliminate or reduce payments during a calendar year under subparagraph (A) if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that the payments, or other circumstances that might require use of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund, could cause the amount in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund during the calendar year to be less than the secure base amount.

            (C) __Reimbursement for Financial Assistance Corporation stock__ 

                (i) __Sufficient funding__

>         “(1)

>             “(A) the effects of direct assessments by the Insurance Corporation on associations, including interest rate charges to borrowers;

>             “(B) the effects of requiring that banks pass along the cost of insurance premiums to owner associations and other financing institutions having a discount relationship with the bank;

>             “(C) the effects of requiring owner associations to purchase stock in the district bank, if needed, to prevent a bank from having to return to the Insurance Corporation for financial assistance once the assistance has been given;

>             “(D) the effects of the purchase of stock from funds of the association (through funds obtained from other than the district bank) or allowing the bank to increase the direct line of credit to the association in order to fund the purchase; and

>         The Comptroller General of the United States shall evaluate and report to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on whether there are likely to be benefits to farmer and rancher borrowers of the Farm Credit System institutions of merging the 10 district Farm Credit Banks (and the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Jackson) into fewer regional Farm Credit Banks.

>         “(2) __Factors.—__ 

>         In preparing the report, the Comptroller General shall consider—
