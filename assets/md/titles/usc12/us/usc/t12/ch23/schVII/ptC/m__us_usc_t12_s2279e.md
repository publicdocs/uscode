## § 2279e. Approval of disclosure information and issuance of charters

    (a) __Disclosure of information__ 

        (1) __Approval of plan__ 

            With respect to any plan of merger, transfer of lending authority, dissolution, or termination, prior to submission to the voters (voting stockholders and, where required, contributors to guaranty funds) of the institutions involved, such plan shall be submitted to the Farm Credit Administration Board, together with all information that is to be distributed to the voters with respect to the contemplated action, including an enumerated statement of the anticipated benefits and potential disadvantages of such action.

        (2) __Notice of approval__ 

            On notification that the Farm Credit Administration Board has approved such plan for submission to the stockholders, or after 60 days of no action on the plan by the Board, the submitting institutions may submit the plan, together with the disclosure information, to the voters for the prescribed vote.

    (b) __Notice of reasons for disapproval__ 

        If the Farm Credit Administration Board disapproves the plan for submission to the stockholders, notification to the submitting institutions shall specify the reasons for the determination by the Board. If such plan is determined to be inadequate, it shall not be submitted to the voters for a vote.

    (c) __Federal charter__ 

        Each plan of merger or transfer of lending authority may include a proposed new or revised Federal charter for the merged or transferee entity. The Farm Credit Administration Board shall issue such charter on the approval of the plan, as prescribed in this subchapter, unless the Board determines that the charter submitted is not consistent with this chapter.
