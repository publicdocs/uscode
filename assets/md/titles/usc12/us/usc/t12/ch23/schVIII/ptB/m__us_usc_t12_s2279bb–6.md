            (B) __Standard for approval__ 

                If the Corporation is classified as within level III, the Director may approve a payment of dividends by the Corporation only if the Director determines that the payment (i) will enhance the ability of the Corporation to meet the risk-based capital level and the minimum capital level promptly, (ii) will contribute to the long-term safety and soundness of the Corporation, or (iii) is otherwise in the public interest.

        (3) __Reclassification from level III to level IV__

                (i) the Corporation does not submit a capital restoration plan that is approved by the Director; or

                (ii) the Director determines that the Corporation has failed to make, in good faith, reasonable efforts necessary to comply with such a capital restoration plan and fulfill the schedule for the plan approved by the Director.

    (b) __Discretionary supervisory actions__ 

    In addition to any other actions taken by the Director (including actions under subsection (a)), the Director may, at any time, take any of the following actions if the Corporation is classified as within level III:
