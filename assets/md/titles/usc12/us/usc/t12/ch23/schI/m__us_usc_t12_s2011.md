>             “(K) __Definitions.—__ 

>             As used in this paragraph:

>                 “(i) __Agricultural credit association.—__ 

>                 The term ‘agricultural credit association’ means an association having the same authorities, attributes, and obligations as, and for all purposes an agricultural credit association resulting from the implementation of the plan under this paragraph shall be deemed to be, an association resulting from the merger of a production credit association and a Federal land bank association under section 7.8 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 ([12 U.S.C. 2279c–1][/us/usc/t12/s2279c–1]).

>             Actions and determinations of the arbitrator, the Farm Credit Administration, or the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review except as provided in this paragraph, nor shall they be subject to the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 5 or chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.

>             “(B) __Agency determinations.—__ 

>                 “(i) __In general.—__

The court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the proceeding in accordance with standard procedures as supplemented by procedures hereinafter provided and no other district court or court of appeals of the United States shall have jurisdiction over any such challenge in any proceeding instituted prior to, on, or after the date of enactment of this subsection. The review of any determination or action of the Farm Credit Administration or the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation under this subsection shall be based on the examination of all of the information before the Farm Credit Administration or the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, as the case may be, at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the determination or action shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless the court has determined, after notice and a hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

>                 “(ii) __Procedures.—__ 

>                 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may set rules governing the procedures of any such proceeding that set page limits on briefs and time limits for filing briefs and motions and other actions that are shorter than the limits specified in the Federal Rules of Civil or Appellate Procedure.

>                 “(i) __In general.—__ 

>                 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, any petition for review of a determination or other action of the arbitrator named under paragraph (2) shall be filed in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act ([9 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t9/s1] et seq.).

>                 “(ii) __Procedures.—__ 

>                 Notwithstanding the United States Arbitration Act ([9 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t9/s1] et seq.), any petition for review of a determination or other action of the arbitrator under this subsection shall be filed not later than 10 days after the determination, or the petition shall be barred. The court specified under such Act shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the proceeding in accordance with the applicable procedures under such Act, as supplemented by procedures hereinafter provided, and no other district court shall have jurisdiction over any such challenge in any such proceeding. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may set rules governing the procedures of any such proceeding that set page limits on briefs and time limits for filing briefs and motions and other actions that are shorter than the limits specified in the United States Arbitration Act or the Federal Rules of Civil or Appellate Procedure \[28 U.S.C. App.\].

>                 “(iii) __Expedited review.—__ 

>                 Any such proceeding before the court shall be assigned for hearing and completed at the earliest possible date, and shall be expedited in every way.
