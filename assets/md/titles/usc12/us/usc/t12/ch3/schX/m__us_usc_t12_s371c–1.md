        (3) __Transactions that benefit affiliate__

                (iii) by law of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship; and

        (2) __Exception__ 

            Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply if the purchase or acquisition of such securities has been approved, before such securities are initially offered for sale to the public, by a majority of the directors of the bank based on a determination that the purchase is a sound investment for the bank irrespective of the fact that an affiliate of the bank is a principal underwriter of the securities.
