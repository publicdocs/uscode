## § 342. Deposits; exchange and collection; member and nonmember banks or other depository institutions; charges

    Any Federal reserve bank may receive from any of its member banks, or other depository institutions, and from the United States, deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, Federal reserve notes, or checks, and drafts, payable upon presentation or other items, and also, for collection, maturing notes and bills; or, solely for purposes of exchange or of collection may receive from other Federal reserve banks deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, or checks upon other Federal reserve banks, and checks and drafts, payable upon presentation within its district or other items, and maturing notes and bills payable within its district; or, solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection, may receive from any nonmember bank or trust company or other depository institution deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, Federal reserve notes, checks and drafts payable upon presentation or other items, or maturing notes and bills: Provided, Such nonmember bank or trust company or other depository institution maintains with the Federal Reserve bank of its district a balance in such amount as the Board determines taking into account items in transit, services provided by the Federal Reserve bank, and other factors as the Board may deem appropriate: Provided further, That nothing in this or any other section of this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting a member or nonmember bank or other depository institution from making reasonable charges, to be determined and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but in no case to exceed 10 cents per $100 or fraction thereof, based on the total of checks and drafts presented at any one time, for collection or payment of checks and drafts and remission therefor by exchange or otherwise; but no such charges shall be made against the Federal reserve banks.

([Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 13][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6/s13] (par.), [38 Stat. 263][/us/stat/38/263]; [Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 461][/us/act/1916-09-07/ch461], [39 Stat. 752][/us/stat/39/752]; [June 21, 1917, ch. 32, § 4][/us/act/1917-06-21/ch32/s4], [40 Stat. 235][/us/stat/40/235]; [Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614][/us/act/1935-08-23/ch614], title II, § 203(a), [49 Stat. 704][/us/stat/49/704]; [Pub. L. 96–221, title I, § 105(a)][/us/pl/96/221/s105/a], Mar. 31, 1980, [94 Stat. 139][/us/stat/94/139].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [act Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6], [38 Stat. 251][/us/stat/38/251], known as the Federal Reserve Act. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see References in Text note set out under [section 226 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s226] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    Section is comprised of the first par. of section 13 of act Dec. 23, 1913. The second par., par. (3), and the fourth to eighth and tenth to fourteenth pars. of section 13 are classified to sections 92, 343 to 347, 347c, 347d, 361, 372, and 373 of this title.

    For decision by U.S. Supreme Court that, despite faulty placement of quotation marks, act Sept. 7, 1916, placed within section 13 of act Dec. 23, 1913, each of the ten pars. located between the phrases that introduced the amendments to sections 13 and 14 of said act, that only the seventh par. (rather than seventh to tenth pars.) comprised the amended R.S. § 5202, and that section 20 of act Apr. 5, 1918 ([40 Stat. 512][/us/stat/40/512]) (which amended R.S. § 5202 comprised of a single par.), did not amend section 13 of said act so as to repeal the eighth to tenth pars., see United States National Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc., et al., 508 U.S. 439, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed. 2d 402 (1993). As the result of subsequent amendments, such seventh to tenth pars. of section 13 now constitute the ninth to twelfth pars. The ninth par. amended former [section 82 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s82], and the tenth to twelfth pars. are classified to sections 361, 92, and 373, respectively, of this title.

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–221][/us/pl/96/221] inserted references to other depository institutions and provisions respecting applicability to other items presented for payment, and substituted provisions setting forth items to constitute required balance to include items in transit, Federal Reserve bank services, and other appropriate factors, for provisions requiring the balance to be sufficient to offset items in transit held for the account of the bank.

 __Change of Name__ 

    Section 203(a) of act Aug. 23, 1935, changed name of Federal Reserve Board to Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–221][/us/pl/96/221] effective on first day of sixth month which begins after Mar. 31, 1980, see [section 108 of Pub. L. 96–221][/us/pl/96/221/s108], set out as a note under [section 248 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s248].
