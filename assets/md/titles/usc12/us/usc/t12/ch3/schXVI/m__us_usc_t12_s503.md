    If the directors or officers of any member bank shall knowingly violate or permit any of the agents, officers, or directors of any member bank to violate any of the provisions of sections 375, 375a, 375b, and 376 of this title or regulations of the board made under authority thereof, or any of the provisions of sections 217, 218, 219, 220, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  655, 1005, 1014, 1906, or 1909 of title 18, every director and officer participating in or assenting to such violation shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the member bank, its shareholders, or any other persons shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.

([Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 22(f)][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6/s22/f], as added [Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, § 5][/us/act/1918-09-26/ch177/s5], [40 Stat. 971][/us/stat/40/971]; amended [Sept. 3, 1954, ch. 1263, § 28][/us/act/1954-09-03/ch1263/s28], [68 Stat. 1236][/us/stat/68/1236].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 217, 218, 219, and 220 of title 18, referred to in text, were renumbered sections 212, 213, 214, and 215 of title 18, respectively, by [Pub. L. 87–849, § 1(d)][/us/pl/87/849/s1/d], Oct. 23, 1962, [76 Stat. 1125][/us/stat/76/1125]. Sections 212 and 213 of title 18, as redesignated, were subsequently repealed by [Pub.

 __Codification__ 

    In text, “sections 375, 375a, 375b, and 376 of this title” was in the original “this section”, meaning section 22 of act Dec. 23, 1913, which was also classified to sections 593 to 599 of this title. Such sections were repealed by [act June 25, 1948, ch. 645, § 21][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645/s21], [62 Stat. 862][/us/stat/62/862], eff. Sept. 1, 1948, and the provisions thereof were reenacted as sections 217, 218, 219, 220, 655, 1005, 1014, 1906, and 1909 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure. Reference to such repealed sections was omitted from the text in view of act Sept. 3, 1954, which amended the text by incorporating therein the reference to the sections of Title 18. The text of [section 375 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s375] was struck out by [Pub. L. 111–203, title VI, § 615(b)][/us/pl/111/203/s615/b], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 1615][/us/stat/124/1615].
