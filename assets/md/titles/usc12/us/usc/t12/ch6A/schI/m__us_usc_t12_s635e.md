## § 635e. Aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority

    (a) __Limitation on outstanding amounts__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Export-Import Bank of the United States shall not have outstanding at any one time loans, guarantees, and insurance in an aggregate amount in excess of the applicable amount.

        (2) __Applicable amount defined__ 

            In this subsection, the term “applicable amount”, for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019, means $135,000,000,000.

        (3) __Freezing of lending cap if default rate is 2 percent or more__ 

            If the rate calculated under [section 635g(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s635g/g/1] is 2 percent or more for a quarter, the Bank may not exceed the amount of loans, guarantees, and insurance outstanding on the last day of that quarter until the rate calculated under [section 635g(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s635g/g/1] is less than 2 percent.

        (4) __Subject to appropriations__ 

            All spending and credit authority provided under this subchapter shall be effective for any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts.

    (b) __Presidential determination__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than March 31 of each fiscal year, the President of the United States shall determine whether the authority available to the Bank for such fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the Bank’s needs, particularly those needs arising from—

            (A) increases in the level of exports unforeseen at the time of the original budget request for such fiscal year;

            (B) any increased foreign export credit subsidies; or

            (C) the lack of progress in negotiations to reduce or eliminate export credit subsidies.

        (2) __Request for legislation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the President of the United States finds that the amount of direct loan authority or guarantee authority available to the Bank for the fiscal year involved exceeds the amount which will be necessary to carry out the Bank’s functions consistent with the availability of qualified applications and limitations imposed by law during such year, the President of the United States shall promptly transmit to the Congress a request for legislation to eliminate the amount of such excess direct loan, loan guarantee, or insurance authority.

            (B) __Continued availability of authority__ 

                The Bank shall continue to make remaining amounts of its authority available for the fiscal year involved, in accordance with its practices and the requirements of this subchapter, unless otherwise directed pursuant to law.
