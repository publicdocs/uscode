 __Amendments__ 

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–429][/us/pl/102/429] inserted second sentence and struck out former second through last sentences which read as follows: “Payment for $1,000,000 of such capital stock shall be made by the surrender to the Bank for cancellation of the common stock issued prior to July 31, 1945, by the Bank and purchased by the United States. Payment for $174,000,000 of such capital stock shall be made by the surrender to the Bank for cancellation of the preferred stock heretofore issued by the Bank and purchased by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Payment for the $825,000,000 balance of such capital stock shall be subject to call at any time in whole or in part by the Board of Directors of the Bank. For the purpose of making payments of such balance, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds of any securities issued after July 31, 1945, under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such purpose. Payment under this section of the subscription of the United States to the Bank and repayments thereof shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. Certificates evidencing stock ownership of the United States shall be issued by the Bank to the President of the United States, or to such other person or persons as the President may designate from time to time, to the extent of the common and preferred stock surrendered and other payments made for the capital stock of the Bank under this section.”

    1968—[Pub. L. 90–267][/us/pl/90/267] changed name of “Export-Import Bank of Washington” to “Export-Import Bank of the United States”.
