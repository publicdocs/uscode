## § 2801. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

    (a) __Findings of Congress__

    (b) __Purpose of chapter__ 

        The purpose of this chapter is to provide the citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether depository institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located and to assist public officials in their determination of the distribution of public sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private investment environment.

    (c) __Construction of chapter__ 

        Nothing in this chapter is intended to, nor shall it be construed to, encourage unsound lending practices or the allocation of credit.
