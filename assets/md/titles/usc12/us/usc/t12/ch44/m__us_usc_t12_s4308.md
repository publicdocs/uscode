        (3) __Contents of regulations__ 

            The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of accounts as, in the judgment of the Bureau, are necessary or proper to carry out the purposes of this chapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion of the requirements of this chapter, or to facilitate compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

        (4) __Date of applicability__ 

            The provisions of this chapter shall not apply with respect to any depository institution before the effective date of regulations prescribed by the Bureau under this subsection (or by the National Credit Union Administration Bureau  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “Board”. </sup></sup>  under section 4311(b)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, in the case of any depository institution described in clause (iv) of [section 461(b)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s461/b/1/A]).

        (2) __Use of forms and clauses deemed in compliance__ 

        Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a depository institution to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Bureau under this subsection.

             uses any such model form or clause and changes it by—

                (i) deleting any information which is not required by this chapter; or

                (ii) rearranging the format,

                if in making such deletion or rearranging the format, the depository institution does not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.

        (3) __Public notice and opportunity for comment__ 

            Model disclosure forms and clauses shall be adopted by the Bureau after duly given notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553].
