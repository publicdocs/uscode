## § 1790d. Prompt corrective action

    (a) __Resolving problems to protect Fund__ 

        (1) __Purpose__ 

            The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.

        (2) __Prompt corrective action required__ 

            The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.

    (b) __Regulations required__ 

        (1) __Insured credit unions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is—

                (i) consistent with this section; and

                (ii) comparable to section 1831o of this title.

            (B) __Cooperative character of credit unions__ 

            The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that—

                (i) do not issue capital stock;

                (ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and

                (iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.

        (2) __New credit unions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Criteria for alternative system__ 

            The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)—

                (i) to carry out the purpose of this section;

                (ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;

                (iii)

                 to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either—

                    (I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or

                    (II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;

                (iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and

                (v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.

    (c) __Net worth categories__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:

            (A) __Well capitalized__ 

            An insured credit union is “well capitalized” if—

                (i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and

                (ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

            (B) __Adequately capitalized__ 

            An insured credit union is “adequately capitalized” if—

                (i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and

                (ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

            (C) __Undercapitalized__ 

            An insured credit union is “undercapitalized” if—

                (i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or

                (ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

            (D) __Significantly undercapitalized__ 

            An insured credit union is “significantly undercapitalized”—

                (i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or

                (ii)

                 if—

                    (I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and

                    (II)

                     it—

                        (aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or

                        (bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.

            (E) __Critically undercapitalized__ 

                An insured credit union is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a net worth ratio of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).

        (2) __Adjusting net worth levels__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If, for purposes of section 1831o(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).

            (B) __Determinations required__ 

            The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board—

                (i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and

                (ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.

            (C) __Transition period required__ 

                If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.

    (d) __Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) shall include a risk-based net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.

        (2) __Standard__ 

            The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.

    (e) __Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.

        (2) __Board’s authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease—

                (i) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and

                (ii) would further the purpose of this section.

            (B) __Periodic review required__ 

                The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).

    (f) __Net worth restoration plan required__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the Board within the time allowed under this subsection.

        (2) __Assistance to small credit unions__ 

            The Board (or the staff of the Board) shall, upon timely request by an insured credit union with total assets of less than $10,000,000, and subject to such regulations or guidelines as the Board may prescribe, assist that credit union in preparing a net worth restoration plan.

        (3) __Deadlines for submission and review of plans__ 

        The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that—

            (A) provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and

            (B) require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.

        (4) __Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed__ 

            (A) __Failure to submit any plan__ 

            If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall—

                (i) promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and

                (ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.

            (B) __Submission of unacceptable plan__ 

            If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall—

                (i) promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and

                (ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.

        (5) __Accepting plan__ 

            The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.

    (g) __Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions__ 

        (1) __Restriction on asset growth__ 

        An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless—

            (A) the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;

            (B) any increase in total assets is consistent with the net worth restoration plan; and

            (C) the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.

        (2) __Restriction on member business loans__ 

            Notwithstanding [section 1757a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1757a/a], an insured credit union that is undercapitalized may not make any increase in the total amount of member business loans (as defined in [section 1757a(c) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1757a/c]) outstanding at that credit union at any one time, until such time as the credit union becomes adequately capitalized.

    (h) __More stringent treatment based on other supervisory criteria__ 

    With respect to the exercise of authority by the Board under regulations comparable to section 1831o(g) of this title—

        (1) the Board may not reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category, or treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category, for reasons not pertaining to the safety and soundness of that credit union; and

        (2) the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.

    (i) __Action required regarding critically undercapitalized credit unions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Board shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which an insured credit union becomes critically undercapitalized—

            (A) appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union; or

            (B) take such other action as the Board determines would better achieve the purpose of this section, after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose.

        (2) __Periodic redeterminations required__ 

            Any determination by the Board under paragraph (1)(B) to take any action with respect to an insured credit union in lieu of appointing a conservator or liquidating agent shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the determination is made, and a conservator or liquidating agent shall be appointed for that credit union under paragraph (1)(A), unless the Board makes a new determination under paragraph (1)(B) before the end of the effective period of the prior determination.

        (3) __Appointment of liquidating agent required if other action fails to restore net worth__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Board shall appoint a liquidating agent for an insured credit union if the credit union is critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 18 months after the date on which the credit union became critically undercapitalized.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may continue to take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate in lieu of appointment of a liquidating agent if—

                (i)

                 the Board determines that—

                    (I) the insured credit union has been in substantial compliance with an approved net worth restoration plan that requires consistent improvement in the net worth of the credit union since the date of the approval of the plan; and

                    (II) the insured credit union has positive net income or has an upward trend in earnings that the Board projects as sustainable; and

                (ii) the Board certifies that the credit union is viable and not expected to fail.

        (4) __Nondelegation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Board may not delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                The Board may delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection with respect to an insured credit union that has less than $5,000,000 in total assets, if the Board permits the credit union to appeal any adverse action to the Board.

    (j) __Reviews required when share insurance fund experiences losses__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If the Fund incurs a material loss with respect to an insured credit union, the Inspector General of the Board shall—

            (A)

             submit to the Board a written report reviewing the supervision of the credit union by the Administration (including the implementation of this section by the Administration), which shall include—

                (iv) to any Member of Congress, upon request.

        (2) __Material loss defined__ 

        For purposes of determining whether the Fund has incurred a material loss with respect to an insured credit union, a loss is material if it exceeds the sum of—

            (A) $25,000,000; and

            (B) an amount equal to 10 percent of the total assets of the credit union on the date on which the Board initiated assistance under [section 1788 of this title][/us/usc/t12/s1788] or was appointed liquidating agent.

        (3) __Public disclosure required__ 

            (A) __In general__

        (4) __Losses that are not material__ 

            (A) __Semiannual report__ 

            For the 6-month period ending on March 31, 2010, and each 6-month period thereafter, the Inspector General of the Board shall—

                (iii)

                 prepare and submit a written report to the Board and to Congress on the results of the determinations of the Inspector General that includes—

                    (I) an identification of any loss that warrants an in-depth review, and the reasons such review is warranted, or if the Inspector General determines that no review is warranted, an explanation of such determination; and

            (C)

             if the official referred to in subparagraph (A) makes a timely written response that disagrees with the proposed action and gives reasons for that disagreement, the Board shall not appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union, unless the Board, after considering the views of the official, has determined that—

                (i) the Fund faces a significant risk of loss with respect to the credit union if a conservator or liquidating agent is not appointed; and

                (ii)

                 the appointment is necessary to reduce—

                    (I) the risk that the Fund would incur a loss with respect to the credit union; or

            (D) the Board may not delegate any determination under subparagraph (C).
