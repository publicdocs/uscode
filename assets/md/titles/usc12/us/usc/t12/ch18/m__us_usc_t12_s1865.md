    (c) __Considerations in determining approval__ 

        In determining whether to approve or deny any application for prior approval or whether to approve or disapprove any notice under this section, the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency, as the case may be, is authorized to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of any insured depository institution and bank service company involved, including the financial capability of the insured depository institution to make a proposed investment under this chapter, and possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, unfair or decreased competition, conflicts of interest, or unsafe or unsound banking practices.
