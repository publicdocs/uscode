## § 1866. Services to nonstockholders or nonmembers

    No bank service company shall unreasonably discriminate in the provision of any services authorized under this chapter to any depository institution that does not own stock in or is not a member of the service company on the basis of the fact that such depository institution is in competition with an institution that owns stock in or is a member of the bank service company, except that—

    (1) it shall not be considered unreasonable discrimination for a bank service company to provide services to a nonstockholding or nonmember institution only at a price that fully reflects all of the costs of offering those services, including the cost of capital and a reasonable return thereon; and

    (2) a bank service company may refuse to provide services to a nonstockholding or nonmember institution if comparable services are available from another source at competitive overall costs, or if the providing of services would be beyond the practical capacity of the service company.
