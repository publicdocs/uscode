    1982—[Pub. L. 97–320][/us/pl/97/320] substituted provisions relating to the maximum permissible amount of investment in a bank service corporation by an insured bank for provisions which read as follows:

    “(b) If stock in a bank service corporation has been held by two banks, and one of such banks ceases to utilize the services of the corporation and ceases to hold stock in it, and leaves the other as the sole stockholding bank, the corporation may nevertheless continue to function as such and the other bank may continue to hold stock in it.”
