    (b) __Allocation formula__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 30 days after September 27, 2010, the Secretary shall allocate Federal funds to participating States so that each State is eligible to receive an amount equal to the average of the respective amounts that the State—

            (A) would receive under the 2009 allocation, as determined under paragraph (2); and

            (B) would receive under the 2010 allocation, as determined under paragraph (3).

        (2) __2009 allocation formula__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall determine the 2009 allocation by allocating Federal funds among the States in the proportion that each such State’s 2008 State employment decline bears to the aggregate of the 2008 State employment declines for all States.

            (B) __Minimum allocation__ 

                The Secretary shall adjust the allocations under subparagraph (A) for each State to the extent necessary to ensure that no State receives less than 0.9 percent of the Federal funds.

            (C) __2008 state employment decline defined__ 

            In this paragraph and with respect to a State, the term “2008 State employment decline” means the excess (if any) of—

                (i) the number of individuals employed in such State determined for December 2007; over

                (ii) the number of individuals employed in such State determined for December 2008.

        (3) __2010 allocation formula__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall determine the 2010 allocation by allocating Federal funds among the States in the proportion that each such State’s 2009 unemployment number bears to the aggregate of the 2009 unemployment numbers for all of the States.

            (B) __Minimum allocation__ 

                The Secretary shall adjust the allocations under subparagraph (A) for each State to the extent necessary to ensure that no State receives less than 0.9 percent of the Federal funds.

            (C) __2009 unemployment number defined__ 

                In this paragraph and with respect to a State, the term “2009 unemployment number” means the number of individuals within such State who were determined to be unemployed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for December 2009.

    (c) __Availability of allocated amount__ 

    The amount allocated by the Secretary to each participating State under subsection (b) shall be made available to the State as follows:

                The Secretary may withhold the transfer of any successive ⅓ pending results of a financial audit.

                (ii) __Recoupment of misused transferred funds required__ 

                    The allocation agreement between the Secretary and the participating State shall provide that the Secretary shall recoup any allocated Federal funds transferred to the participating State if the results of the an audit include a finding that there was an intentional or reckless misuse of transferred funds by the State.

                (iii) __Penalty for misstatement__ 

                    Any participating State that is found to have intentionally misstated any report issued to the Secretary under the Program shall be ineligible to receive any additional funds under the Program. Funds that had been allocated or that would otherwise have been allocated to such participating State shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt.

                (iv) __Municipalities__ 

                    In this subparagraph, the term “participating State” shall include a municipality given special permission to participate in the Program, under [section 5703(d) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5703/d].
