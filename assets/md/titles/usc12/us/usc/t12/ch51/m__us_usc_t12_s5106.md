## § 5106. System of registration administration by Federal agencies

    (a) __Development__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Bureau shall develop and maintain a system for registering employees of a depository institution, employees of a subsidiary that is owned and controlled by a depository institution and regulated by a Federal banking agency, or employees of an institution regulated by the Farm Credit Administration, as registered loan originators with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. The system shall be implemented before the end of the 1-year period beginning on July 21, 2010.

        (2) __Registration requirements__ 

        In connection with the registration of any loan originator under this subsection, the Bureau shall, at a minimum, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry information concerning the identity of the employee, including—

            (A) fingerprints for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and any governmental agency or entity authorized to receive such information for a State and national criminal history background check; and

            (B) personal history and experience, including authorization for the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to obtain information related to any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction.

    (b) __Coordination__ 

        (1) __Unique identifier__ 

            The Bureau, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each registered loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators.

        (2) __Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry development__ 

            To facilitate the transfer of information required by subsection (a)(2), the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry shall coordinate with the Bureau,1 and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection concerning the development and operation, by such System and Registry, of the registration functionality and data requirements for loan originators.

    (c) __Consideration of factors and procedures__ 

        In establishing the registration procedures under subsection (a) and the protocols for assigning a unique identifier to a registered loan originator, the Bureau shall make such de minimis exceptions as may be appropriate to paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of [section 5103(a) of this title][/us/usc/t12/s5103/a], shall make reasonable efforts to utilize existing information to minimize the burden of registering loan originators, and shall consider methods for automating the process to the greatest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

([Pub. L. 110–289, div. A, title V, § 1507][/us/pl/110/289/s1507], July 30, 2008, [122 Stat. 2817][/us/stat/122/2817]; [Pub. L. 111–203, title X, § 1100(2)][/us/pl/111/203/s1100/2], (5), July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 2106][/us/stat/124/2106].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 111–203, § 1100(5)(A)(i)][/us/pl/111/203/s1100/5/A/i], added par. (1) and struck out former par. (1). Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “The Federal banking agencies shall jointly, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, and together with the Farm Credit Administration, develop and maintain a system for registering employees of a depository institution, employees of a subsidiary that is owned and controlled by a depository institution and regulated by a Federal banking agency, or employees of an institution regulated by the Farm Credit Administration, as registered loan originators with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. The system shall be implemented before the end of the 1-year period beginning on July 30, 2008.”

    Subsec. (a)(2). [Pub. L. 111–203, § 1100(5)(A)(ii)][/us/pl/111/203/s1100/5/A/ii], in introductory provisions, substituted “Bureau” for “appropriate Federal banking agency and the Farm Credit Administration” and “identity of the employee” for “employees’s identity”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 111–203, § 1100(5)(B)][/us/pl/111/203/s1100/5/B], which directed substitution of “and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection” for “through the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and the Farm Credit Administration”, was executed in both places those words appeared, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsecs. (b)(1), (2), (c). [Pub. L. 111–203, § 1100(2)][/us/pl/111/203/s1100/2], substituted “Bureau” for “Federal banking agencies”.

 __Effective Date of 2010 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203] effective on the designated transfer date, see [section 1100H of Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203/s1100H], set out as a note under [section 552a of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552a], Government Organization and Employees.
