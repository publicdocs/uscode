## § 5107. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection backup authority to establish loan originator licensing system

    (a) __Backup licensing system__ 

        If, by the end of the 1-year period, or the 2-year period in the case of a State whose legislature meets only biennially, beginning on July 30, 2008, or at any time thereafter, the Director determines that a State does not have in place by law or regulation a system for licensing and registering loan originators that meets the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) of this section, or does not participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, the Director shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a system for the licensing and registration by the Director of loan originators operating in such State as State-licensed loan originators.

    (b) __Licensing and registration requirements__ 

        The system established by the Director under subsection (a) for any State shall meet the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title for State-licensed loan originators.

    (c) __Unique identifier__ 

        The Director shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each loan originator licensed by the Director as a State-licensed loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators.

    (d) __State licensing law requirements__ 

    For purposes of this section, the law in effect in a State meets the requirements of this subsection if the Director determines the law satisfies the following minimum requirements:

        (1) A State loan originator supervisory authority is maintained to provide effective supervision and enforcement of such law, including the suspension, termination, or nonrenewal of a license for a violation of State or Federal law.

        (2) The State loan originator supervisory authority ensures that all State-licensed loan originators operating in the State are registered with Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

        (3) The State loan originator supervisory authority is required to regularly report violations of such law, as well as enforcement actions and other relevant information, to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

        (4) The State loan originator supervisory authority has a process in place for challenging information contained in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

        (5) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established a mechanism to assess civil money penalties for individuals acting as mortgage originators in their State without a valid license or registration.

        (6) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established minimum net worth or surety bonding requirements that reflect the dollar amount of loans originated by a residential mortgage loan originator, or has established a recovery fund paid into by the loan originators.

    (e) __Temporary extension of period__ 

        The Director may extend, by not more than 24 months, the 1-year or 2-year period, as the case may be, referred to in subsection (a) for the licensing of loan originators in any State under a State licensing law that meets the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) if the Director determines that such State is making a good faith effort to establish a State licensing law that meets such requirements, license mortgage originators under such law, and register such originators with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

    (f) __Regulation authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Bureau is authorized to promulgate regulations setting minimum net worth or surety bond requirements for residential mortgage loan originators and minimum requirements for recovery funds paid into by loan originators.

        (2) __Considerations__ 

            In issuing regulations under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into account the need to provide originators adequate incentives to originate affordable and sustainable mortgage loans, as well as the need to ensure a competitive origination market that maximizes consumer access to affordable and sustainable mortgage loans.
