## § 3355. Broker price opinions

    (a) __General prohibition__ 

        In conjunction with the purchase of a consumer’s principal dwelling, broker price opinions may not be used as the primary basis to determine the value of a piece of property for the purpose of a loan origination of a residential mortgage loan secured by such piece of property.

    (b) __Broker price opinion defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “broker price opinion” means an estimate prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or sales person that details the probable selling price of a particular piece of real estate property and provides a varying level of detail about the property’s condition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales, but does not include an automated valuation model, as defined in section 3354(c)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

([Pub. L. 101–73, title XI, § 1126][/us/pl/101/73/s1126], as added [Pub. L. 111–203, title XIV, § 1473(r)][/us/pl/111/203/s1473/r], July 21, 2010, [124 Stat. 2198][/us/stat/124/2198].)
