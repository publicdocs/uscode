##### § 458. Bounties for induction; substitutes; purchase of release

No person may be enlisted, inducted, or appointed in an armed force as a substitute for another. No person liable for training and service under section 4 \[section 454 of this Appendix\] may escape that training and service or be discharged before the end of his period of training and service by paying money or any other valuable thing as consideration for his release from that training and service or liability therefor.
