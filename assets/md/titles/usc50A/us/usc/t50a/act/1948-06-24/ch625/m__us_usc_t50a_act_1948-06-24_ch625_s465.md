    (b) It shall be the duty of every registrant to keep his local board informed as to his current address and changes in status as required by such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the President.

    (c) If any provision of this title \[sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix\], or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the title \[said sections\], and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

    (d) Except as provided in section 4(c) \[section 454(c) of this Appendix\], nothing contained in this title \[sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix\] shall be construed to repeal, amend, or suspend the laws now in force authorizing voluntary enlistment or reenlistment in the Armed Forces of the United States, including the reserve components thereof, except that no person shall be accepted for enlistment after he has been issued an order to report for induction unless authorized by the Director and the Secretary of Defense and except that, whenever the Congress or the President has declared that the national interest is imperiled, voluntary enlistment or reenlistment in such forces, and their reserve components, may be suspended by the President to such extent as he may deem necessary in the interest of national defense.

    (e) In order to assist the Armed Forces in recruiting individuals for voluntary service in the Armed Forces, the Director shall, upon the request of the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security, furnish to the Secretary the names and addresses of individuals registered under this Act.
