##### § 321. Establishment of Office of Selective Service Records; appointment of Director

([Mar. 31, 1947, ch. 26, § 1][/us/act/1947-03-31/ch26/s1], [61 Stat. 31][/us/stat/61/31].)

 __Codification__ 

    Provisions that fixed the compensation of the Director at $10,000 per year were omitted as obsolete and superseded. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub.

[Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.
