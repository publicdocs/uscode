##### § 582. Certificates of service; persons reported missing

    (a) __Prima facie evidence__ 

    In any proceeding under this Act \[sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix\], a certificate signed by the Secretary concerned is prima facie evidence as to any of the following facts stated in the certificate:

        (1) That a person named is, is not, has been, or has not been in military service.

        (2) The time and the place the person entered military service.

        (3) The person’s residence at the time the person entered military service.

        (4) The rank, branch, and unit of military service of the person upon entry.

        (5) The inclusive dates of the person’s military service.

        (6) The monthly pay received by the person at the date of the certificate’s issuance.

        (7) The time and place of the person’s termination of or release from military service, or the person’s death during military service.

    (b) __Certificates__ 

        The Secretary concerned shall furnish a certificate under subsection (a) upon receipt of an application for such a certificate. A certificate appearing to be signed by the Secretary concerned is prima facie evidence of its contents and of the signer’s authority to issue it.

    (c) __Treatment of servicemembers in missing status__ 

        A servicemember who has been reported missing is presumed to continue in service until accounted for. A requirement under this Act \[sections 501 to 515 and 516 to 597b of this Appendix\] that begins or ends with the death of a servicemember does not begin or end until the servicemember’s death is reported to, or determined by, the Secretary concerned or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
