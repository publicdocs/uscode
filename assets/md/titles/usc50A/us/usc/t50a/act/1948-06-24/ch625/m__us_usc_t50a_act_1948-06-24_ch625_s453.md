    The Congress of the United States has made available the funds (H.J. Res. 521, approved by me on June 27, 1980 \[[Pub.

Also, I direct the heads of Executive agencies, when requested by the Director of Selective Service and to the extent permitted by law, to cooperate and assist in carrying out the purposes of this Proclamation.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.

                              Jimmy Carter.
