        (3) A quorum of any local board or appeal board shall be present during the registrant’s personal appearance.

        (4) In the event of a decision adverse to the claim of a registrant, the local or appeal board making such decision shall, upon request, furnish to such registrant a brief written statement of the reasons for its decision.
