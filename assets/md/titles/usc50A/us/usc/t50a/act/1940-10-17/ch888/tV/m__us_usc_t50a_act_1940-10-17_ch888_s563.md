##### § 563. Desert-land entries

    (a) __Desert-land rights not forfeited__ 

    A desert-land entry made or held under the desert-land laws before the entrance of the entryman or the entryman’s successor in interest into military service shall not be subject to contest or cancellation—

        (1) for failure to expend any required amount per acre per year in improvements upon the claim;

        (2) for failure to effect the reclamation of the claim during the period the entryman or the entryman’s successor in interest is in the military service, or for 180 days after termination of or release from military service; or

        (3) during any period of hospitalization or rehabilitation due to an injury or disability incurred in the line of duty.

        The time within which the entryman or claimant is required to make such expenditures and effect reclamation of the land shall be exclusive of the time periods described in paragraphs (2) and (3).

    (b) __Service-related disability__ 

        If an entryman or claimant is honorably discharged and is unable to accomplish reclamation of, and payment for, desert land due to a disability incurred in the line of duty, the entryman or claimant may make proof without further reclamation or payments, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, and receive a patent for the land entered or claimed.

    (c) __Filing requirement__ 

        In order to obtain the protection of this section, the entryman or claimant shall, within 180 days after entry into military service, cause to be filed in the land office of the district where the claim is situated a notice communicating the fact of military service and the desire to hold the claim under this section.
