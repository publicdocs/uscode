    (c) Any member appointed for a 7-year term may not be reappointed to any following term but may continue to serve beyond the expiration of the term until a successor is appointed and has qualified, except that such member may not continue to serve for more than one year after the date on which the term of the member would otherwise expire under this section.

    (d) Any member may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.
