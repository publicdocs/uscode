    In subsection (a), the term “State or local officer or employee”, defined in section 1501, is substituted for the first 41 words of former section 118k(a). The words “any part of his salary or compensation” are omitted as included in “anything of value”.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __Amendments__ 

    2012—Subsec. (a)(3). [Pub. L. 112–230, § 2][/us/pl/112/230/s2], amended par. (3) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (3) read as follows: “be a candidate for elective office.”

    Subsec. (c)(3). [Pub. L. 112–230, § 3(c)][/us/pl/112/230/s3/c], which directed the substitution of “, municipality, or the District of Columbia’ ” for “ ‘or municipality” and “, municipal, or the District of Columbia’ ” for “ ‘or municipal”, was executed by substituting “, municipality, or the District of Columbia” for “or municipality” and “, municipal, or the District of Columbia” for “or municipal”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1974—Subsec. (a)(3). [Pub. L. 93–443][/us/pl/93/443] substituted “be a candidate for elective office” for “take an active part in political management or in political campaigns”.
