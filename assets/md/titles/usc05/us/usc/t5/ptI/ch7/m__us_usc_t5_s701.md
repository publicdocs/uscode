    In subsection (a), the words “This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof,” are added to avoid the necessity of repeating the introductory clause of former section 1009 in sections 702–706.

    Subsection (b) is added on authority of [section 2 of the Act of June 11, 1946, ch. 324][/us/act/1946-06-11/ch324/s2], [60 Stat. 237][/us/stat/60/237], as amended, which is carried into [section 551 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s551].

    In subsection (b)(1)(G), the words “or naval” are omitted as included in “military”.

    In subsection (b)(1)(H), the words “functions which by law expire on the termination of present hostilities, within any fixed period thereafter, or before July 1, 1947” are omitted as executed. Reference to the “Selective Training and Service Act of 1940” is omitted as that Act expired on Mar. 31, 1947. Reference to the “Sugar Control Extension Act of 1947” is omitted as that Act expired on Mar. 31, 1948. References to the “Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended” and the “Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946” have been consolidated as they are related. The reference to former [section 1641(b)(2) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s1641/b/2], appendix, is retained notwithstanding its repeal by [§ 111(a)(1) of the Act of Sept. 21, 1961][/us/act/1961-09-21/s111/a/1], [Pub. L. 87–256][/us/pl/87/256], [75 Stat. 538][/us/stat/75/538], since § 111(c) of the Act provides that a reference in other Acts to a provision of law repealed by § 111(a) shall be considered to be a reference to the appropriate provisions of [Pub. L. 87–256][/us/pl/87/256].

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 1884 and 1891–1902 of title 50, appendix, referred to in subsec.
