    In the first and last sentences, the words “This subchapter, chapter 7, and sections 1305, 3105, 3344, 4301(2)(E), 5362, and 7521, and the provisions of [section 5335(a)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5335/a/B] that relate to hearing examiners” are substituted for “this Act” to reflect the codification of the Act in this title. The words “to diminish the constitutional rights of any person or” are omitted as surplusage as there is nothing in the Act that can reasonably be construed to diminish those rights and because a statute may not operate in derogation of the Constitution.
