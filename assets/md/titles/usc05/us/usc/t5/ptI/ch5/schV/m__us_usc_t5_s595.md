## § 595. Organization of the Conference

    (a)

     The membership of the Administrative Conference of the United States meeting in plenary session constitutes the Assembly of the Conference. The Assembly has ultimate authority over all activities of the Conference. Specifically, it has the power to—

        (1) adopt such recommendations as it considers appropriate for improving administrative procedure. A member who disagrees with a recommendation adopted by the Assembly is entitled to enter a dissenting opinion and an alternate proposal in the record of the Conference proceedings, and the opinion and proposal so entered shall accompany the Conference recommendation in a publication or distribution thereof; and

        (2) adopt bylaws and regulations not inconsistent with this subchapter for carrying out the functions of the Conference, including the creation of such committees as it considers necessary for the conduct of studies and the development of recommendations for consideration by the Assembly.

    (b)

     The Conference includes a Council composed of the Chairman of the Conference, who is Chairman of the Council, and 10 other members appointed by the President, of whom not more than one-half shall be employees of Federal regulatory agencies or Executive departments. The President may designate a member of the Council as Vice Chairman. During the absence or incapacity of the Chairman, or when that office is vacant, the Vice Chairman shall serve as Chairman. The term of each member, except the Chairman, is 3 years. When the term of a member ends, he may continue to serve until a successor is appointed. However, the service of any member ends when a change in his employment status would make him ineligible for Council membership under the conditions of his original appointment. The Council has the power to—

        (1) determine the time and place of plenary sessions of the Conference and the agenda for the sessions. The Council shall call at least one plenary session each year;

        (2) propose bylaws and regulations, including rules of procedure and committee organization, for adoption by the Assembly;

        (3) make recommendations to the Conference or its committees on a subject germane to the purpose of the Conference;

        (4) receive and consider reports and recommendations of committees of the Conference and send them to members of the Conference with the views and recommendations of the Council;

        (5) designate a member of the Council to preside at meetings of the Council in the absence or incapacity of the Chairman and Vice Chairman;

        (6) designate such additional officers of the Conference as it considers desirable;

        (7) approve or revise the budgetary proposals of the Chairman; and

        (8) exercise such other powers as may be delegated to it by the Assembly.

    (c)

     The Chairman is the chief executive of the Conference. In that capacity he has the power to—

        (1) make inquiries into matters he considers important for Conference consideration, including matters proposed by individuals inside or outside the Federal Government;

        (2) be the official spokesman for the Conference in relations with the several branches and agencies of the Federal Government and with interested organizations and individuals outside the Government, including responsibility for encouraging Federal agencies to carry out the recommendations of the Conference;

        (3) request agency heads to provide information needed by the Conference, which information shall be supplied to the extent permitted by law;

        (4) recommend to the Council appropriate subjects for action by the Conference;

        (5) appoint, with the approval of the Council, members of committees authorized by the bylaws and regulations of the Conference;

        (6) prepare, for approval of the Council, estimates of the budgetary requirements of the Conference;

        (7) appoint and fix the pay of employees, define their duties and responsibilities, and direct and supervise their activities;

        (8) rent office space in the District of Columbia;

        (9) provide necessary services for the Assembly, the Council, and the committees of the Conference;

        (10) organize and direct studies ordered by the Assembly or the Council, to contract for the performance of such studies with any public or private persons, firm, association, corporation, or institution under title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended ([41 U.S.C. 251–260][/us/usc/t41/s251–260]), and to use from time to time, as appropriate, experts and consultants who may be employed in accordance with [section 3109 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3109] at rates not in excess of the maximum rate of pay for grade GS–15 as provided in [section 5332 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5332];

        (11) utilize, with their consent, the services and facilities of Federal agencies and of State and private agencies and instrumentalities with or without reimbursement;

        (12) accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts, devises, and bequests of property, both real and personal, for the purpose of aiding and facilitating the work of the Conference. Gifts and bequests of money and proceeds from sales of other property received as gifts, devises, or bequests shall be deposited in the Treasury and shall be disbursed upon the order of the Chairman. Property accepted pursuant to this section, and the proceeds thereof, shall be used as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms of the gifts, devises, or bequests. For purposes of Federal income, estate, or gift taxes, property accepted under this section shall be considered as a gift, devise, or bequest to the United States;

        (13) accept voluntary and uncompensated services, notwithstanding the provisions of [section 1342 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1342];

        (14) on request of the head of an agency, furnish assistance and advice on matters of administrative procedure;

        (15) exercise such additional authority as the Council or Assembly delegates to him; and

        (16) request any administrative agency to notify the Chairman of its intent to enter into any contract with any person outside the agency to study the efficiency, adequacy, or fairness of an agency proceeding (as defined in [section 551(12) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s551/12]).

        The Chairman shall preside at meetings of the Council and at each plenary session of the Conference, to which he shall make a full report concerning the affairs of the Conference since the last preceding plenary session. The Chairman, on behalf of the Conference, shall transmit to the President and Congress an annual report and such interim reports as he considers desirable.

    In subsection (b), the words “except that the Council members initially appointed shall serve for one, two, or three years, as designated by the President” are omitted as executed, existing rights being preserved by technical section 8.

    In subsection (b)(1), the words “the sessions” are substituted for “such meetings” for clarity as elsewhere the word “sessions” refers to sessions of the Conference and “meetings” refers to meetings of the Council.

    In subsection (c)(7), the words “subject to the civil service and classification laws” are omitted as unnecessary inasmuch as appointments in the executive branch are made subject to the civil service laws and pay is fixed under classification laws unless specifically excepted. The words “and fix the pay of” are added for clarity.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
