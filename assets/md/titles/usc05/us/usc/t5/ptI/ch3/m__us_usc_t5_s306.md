        (2) general goals and objectives, including outcome-oriented goals, for the major functions and operations of the agency;

        (3) a description of how any goals and objectives contribute to the Federal Government priority goals required by [section 1120(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1120/a];

        (4)

         a description of how the goals and objectives are to be achieved, including—

            (A) a description of the operational processes, skills and technology, and the human, capital, information, and other resources required to achieve those goals and objectives; and

            (B) a description of how the agency is working with other agencies to achieve its goals and objectives as well as relevant Federal Government priority goals;

        (5) a description of how the goals and objectives incorporate views and suggestions obtained through congressional consultations required under subsection (d);

        (6) a description of how the performance goals provided in the plan required by [section 1115(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1115/a], including the agency priority goals required by [section 1120(b) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1120/b], if applicable, contribute to the general goals and objectives in the strategic plan;

        (7) an identification of those key factors external to the agency and beyond its control that could significantly affect the achievement of the general goals and objectives; and

        (8) a description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revising general goals and objectives, with a schedule for future program evaluations to be conducted.

    (b) The strategic plan shall cover a period of not less than 4 years following the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted.

The agency shall consult with the appropriate committees of Congress at least once every 2 years.

    (e) The functions and activities of this section shall be considered to be inherently governmental functions. The drafting of strategic plans under this section shall be performed only by Federal employees.
