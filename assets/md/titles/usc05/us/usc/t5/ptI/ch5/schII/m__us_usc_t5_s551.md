    In paragraph (1), the sentence “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal delegations of authority as provided by law,” is omitted as surplusage since there is nothing in the Act which could reasonably be so construed.

    In paragraph (1)(G), the words “or naval” are omitted as included in “military”.

    In paragraph (1)(H), the words “functions which by law expire on the termination of present hostilities, within any fixed period thereafter, or before July 1, 1947” are omitted as executed. Reference to the “Selective Training and Service Act of 1940” is omitted as that Act expired Mar. 31, 1947. Reference to the “Sugar Control Extension Act of 1947” is omitted as that Act expired on Mar. 31, 1948. References to the “Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended” and the “Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946” have been consolidated as they are related. The reference to former [section 1641(b)(2) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s1641/b/2], appendix, is retained notwithstanding its repeal by [§ 111(a)(1) of the Act of Sept. 21, 1961][/us/act/1961-09-21/s111/a/1], [Pub. L. 87–256][/us/pl/87/256], [75 Stat. 538][/us/stat/75/538], since § 111(c) of the Act provides that a reference in other Acts to a provision of law repealed by § 111(a) shall be considered to be a reference to the appropriate provisions of [Pub. L. 87–256][/us/pl/87/256].

    In paragraph (2), the words “of any character” are omitted as surplusage.

    In paragraph (3), the words “and a person or agency admitted by an agency as a party for limited purposes” are substituted for “but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent an agency from admitting any person or agency as a party for limited purposes”.

    In paragraph (9), a comma is supplied between the words “limitation” and “amendment” to correct an editorial error of omission.

    In paragraph (10)(C), the words “of any form” are omitted as surplusage.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
