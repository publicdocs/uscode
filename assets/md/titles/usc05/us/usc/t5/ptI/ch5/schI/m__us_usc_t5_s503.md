    Former sections 95 and 95a are combined and restated for clarity and brevity. The words “or expenses in the case of Government officers and employees” are omitted as covered by [section 1823 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1823]. The word “agency” is substituted for “department” and defined to conform to the definition of “department” in [section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch744/s18], [60 Stat. 811][/us/stat/60/811].

    This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343], § 201(d), as added [Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412][/us/act/1949-08-10/ch412], § 4, [63 Stat. 579][/us/stat/63/579] (former [5 U.S.C. 171–1][/us/usc/t5/s171–1]), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act \[National Security Act of 1947\], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
