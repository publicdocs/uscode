## § 104. Independent establishment

    For the purpose of this title, “independent establishment” means—

    (1) an establishment in the executive branch (other than the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission) which is not an Executive department, military department, Government corporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment; and

    (2) the Government Accountability Office.

([Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 379][/us/stat/80/379]; [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375], § 6(c)(2), Aug. 12, 1970, [84 Stat. 775][/us/stat/84/775]; [Pub. L. 108–271][/us/pl/108/271], § 8(b), July 7, 2004, [118 Stat. 814][/us/stat/118/814]; [Pub. L. 109–435, title VI][/us/pl/109/435/tVI], § 604(b), Dec. 20, 2006, [120 Stat. 3241][/us/stat/120/3241].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    The section is supplied to avoid the necessity for defining “independent establishment” each time it is used in this title.

    Certain agencies are not independent establishments under the definition since they are constituent agencies or parts of an independent establishment. However, these agencies would continue to be subject to the provisions of this title applicable to the independent establishment of which they are a constituent or part. Also, the definition does not expand or abridge any rights or authority possessed by these agencies as no substantive changes are intended, see section 7(a) of the bill.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Par. (1). [Pub. L. 109–435][/us/pl/109/435] substituted “Postal Regulatory Commission” for “Postal Rate Commission”.

    2004—Par. (2). [Pub. L. 108–271][/us/pl/108/271] substituted “Government Accountability Office” for “General Accounting Office”.

    1970—Par. (1). [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] inserted “(other than the United States Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission)” after “executive branch”.

 __Effective Date of 1970 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by Board of Governors of United States Postal Service and published by it in Federal Register, see [section 15(a) of Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375/s15/a], set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s101], Postal Service.
