    In subsection (a), the words “Except as otherwise specifically provided by this title or other statute” are added because of the statutes carried into subchapter III of chapter 83. The words “of Federal personnel of whatever class, civil, military, naval, judicial, legislative, or otherwise, and for whatever cause retired” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “and said first day of the month for retirements made after July 1, 1930, shall be for all purposes in lieu of such date for retirement as was on April 23, 1930, authorized” are omitted as executed.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
