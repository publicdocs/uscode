    Paragraph (6), relating to Official Reporters of Debates of the Senate and their employees, is eliminated as unnecessary on authority of the act of July 27, 1965 ([2 U.S.C. 126–1][/us/usc/t2/s126–1]). Pursuant to that act, the Official Reporters and their employees became employees of the Senate; accordingly, they are now included within the definition of “Congressional employee” under paragraph (1).

    In paragraph (8), based on the act of September 26, 1966 (5 App. U.S.C. 2251(c)), the word “officers” is omitted as included in “employees,” and the words “United States” preceding the words “Botanic Garden” are omitted as unnecessary.

    1970—Par. (9). Pub. L. 91—510 added par. (9).
