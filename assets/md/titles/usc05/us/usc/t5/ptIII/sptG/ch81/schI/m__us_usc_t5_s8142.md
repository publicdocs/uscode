    Subsection (a) is based on sections 2504(a), 2505, and 2507(a) of title 22.

    In subsection (b), the words “Subject to the provisions of this section” are added for clarity and to conform to the style of sections 8140 and 8141. The words “of the United States Government” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “employee” in section 8101(1).

    Subsection (c)(4) is added on authority of [section 2522(e) of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s2522/e].
