    Subsection (a) was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 201(d)][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343/s201/d], as added [Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, § 4][/us/act/1949-08-10/ch412/s4], [63 Stat. 579][/us/stat/63/579] (former [5 U.S.C. 171–1][/us/usc/t5/s171–1]), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act \[National Security Act of 1947\], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

    In subsection (a), the words “regular office” are coextensive with and substituted for “proper office”.

    In subsection (b), former sections 69 (1st 34 words) and 72 are combined and restated for clarity and conciseness. The word “employee” is coextensive with and substituted for “officer or clerk”, “officer or clerk in the same or any other department”, and “person employed in the service of the United States”. The words “under any general or lump-sum appropriation” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
