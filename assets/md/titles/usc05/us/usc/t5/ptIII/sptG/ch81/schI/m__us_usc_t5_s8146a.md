## § 8146a. Cost-of-living adjustment of compensation

    (a) Compensation payable on account of disability or death which occurred more than one year before March 1 of each year shall be annually increased on that date by the amount determined by the Secretary of Labor to represent the percent change in the price index published for December of the preceding year over the price index published for the December of the year prior to the preceding year, adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent.

    (b) The regular periodic compensation payments after adjustment under this section shall be fixed at the nearest dollar. However, the regular periodic compensation after adjustment shall reflect an increase of at least $1.

    (c) This section shall be applicable to persons excluded by section 15 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966 ([Public Law 89–488][/us/pl/89/488]) under the following statutes: Act of February 15, 1934 ([48 Stat. 351][/us/stat/48/351]); Act of June 26, 1936 ([49 Stat. 2035][/us/stat/49/2035]); Act of April 8, 1935 ([49 Stat. 115][/us/stat/49/115]); Act of July 25, 1942 ([56 Stat. 710][/us/stat/56/710]); [Public Law 84–955][/us/pl/84/955] (August 3, 1956); [Public Law 77–784][/us/pl/77/784] (December 2, 1942); [Public Law 84–879][/us/pl/84/879] (August 1, 1956); [Public Law 80–896][/us/pl/80/896] (July 3, 1948); Act of September 8, 1959 ([73 Stat. 469][/us/stat/73/469]). Benefit payments to these persons shall initially be increased by the total percentage of the increases in the price index from the base month of July 1966, to the next most recent base month following the effective date of this subsection.

(Added [Pub. L. 90–83, § 1(67)(A)][/us/pl/90/83/s1/67/A], Sept. 11, 1967, [81 Stat. 212][/us/stat/81/212]; amended [Pub.

    In subsection (a), the words “After the month during which this section becomes effective,” following “Each month,” are omitted as executed and unnecessary. The words “Secretary of Labor” are substituted for “Secretary” on authority of section 40(i) of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. In the second sentence, the words “latest base month” are substituted for “most recent base month.”

    So much of [section 14 of Public Law 89–488][/us/pl/89/488/s14] as redesignated section 43 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act as section 44 is omitted as unnecessary in view of the codification of that act in title 5, United States Code.

 __References in Text__ 

“Persons excluded by section 15 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966”, referred to in subsec. (c), means persons excluded by [section 15 of Pub. L. 89–488][/us/pl/89/488/s15], July 4, 1966, [80 Stat. 256][/us/stat/80/256], which was set out as a note under section 756 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, prior to the 1966 revision of Title 5 by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554]. Such section 15 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966 directed that benefit increases mandated by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966 not apply to employees unless such employees fell within the definition of “employees” in section 40(b) (1) or (2) of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act \[section 790(b)(1) or (2) of former Title 5\]. As a result section 15 of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act Amendments of 1966 served to prohibit increases to persons to whom the benefits of the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act had been extended over the years by Acts described in subsec. (c) as follows:

    Act of February 15, 1934 ([48 Stat. 351][/us/stat/48/351]) which extended coverage to employees of the Federal Civil Works Administration and was classified to section 796 of former Title 5.

    Act of June 26, 1936 ([49 Stat. 2035][/us/stat/49/2035]) probably means Act of June 29, 1936 which extended coverage to certain W.W. I veterans and was set out as a note under section 134 of former Title 38, Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans’ Relief.

    Act of April 8, 1935 ([49 Stat. 115][/us/stat/49/115]) which extended coverage to certain emergency relief personnel, is [act April 8, 1935, ch. 48][/us/act/1935-04-08/ch48], [49 Stat. 115][/us/stat/49/115], which was enacted as legislation supplementary to the Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933, was classified to sections 721 and 728 of Title 15, Commerce and Trade, and was omitted from the Code as temporary.

    Act of July 25, 1942 ([56 Stat. 710][/us/stat/56/710]) which extended coverage to certain personnel of the War Relocation Authority, was set out as a note under section 796 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.

    [Public Law 84–955][/us/pl/84/955] (Aug. 3, 1956) which extended coverage to certain Civil Air Patrol personnel was set out as a note under section 760 of former Title 5.

    [Public Law 77–784][/us/pl/77/784] (December 2, 1942), which extended coverage to war risk hazards of certain employees of federal contractors, is [act Dec. 2, 1942, ch. 668][/us/act/1942-12-02/ch668], [56 Stat. 1028][/us/stat/56/1028], as amended, titles I and II of which are popularly known as the War Hazards Compensation Act, and is classified principally to chapter 12 (§ 1701 et seq.) of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

    [Public Law 84–879][/us/pl/84/879] (August 1, 1956), which extended coverage to certain members of the Reserve Officers Training Corps of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, was classified to section 802 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.

    [Public Law 80–896][/us/pl/80/896] (July 3, 1948), which extended coverage to certain persons entitled to war claims, is [act July 3, 1948, ch. 826][/us/act/1948-07-03/ch826], [62 Stat. 1240][/us/stat/62/1240], popularly known as the War Claims Act of 1948, which is classified generally to chapter 51 (§ 4101 et seq.) of Title 50, War and National Defense. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

    Act of September 8, 1959 ([73 Stat. 469][/us/stat/73/469]) which transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Labor certain functions in respect to insurance benefits and disability payments to seamen for W.W. II service-connected injuries, death, or disability, was not classified to the Code.
