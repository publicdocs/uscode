## § 2303. Prohibited personnel practices in the Federal Bureau of Investigation

    (a)

     Any employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to any employee of the Bureau as a reprisal for a disclosure of information by the employee to the Attorney General (or an employee designated by the Attorney General for such purpose) which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences—

        (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or

        (2) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.

        For the purpose of this subsection, “personnel action” means any action described in clauses (i) through (x) of [section 2302(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2302/a/2/A] with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a position in the Bureau (other than a position of a confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating character).

    (b) The Attorney General shall prescribe regulations to ensure that such a personnel action shall not be taken against an employee of the Bureau as a reprisal for any disclosure of information described in subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) The President shall provide for the enforcement of this section in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of sections 1214 and 1221 of this title.

(Added [Pub. L. 95–454, title I][/us/pl/95/454/tI], § 101(a), Oct. 13, 1978, [92 Stat. 1117][/us/stat/92/1117]; amended [Pub. L. 101–12][/us/pl/101/12], § 9(a)(1), Apr. 10, 1989, [103 Stat. 34][/us/stat/103/34].)
