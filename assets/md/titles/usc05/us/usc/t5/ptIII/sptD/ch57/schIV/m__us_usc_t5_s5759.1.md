## § 5759. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. No section 5758 has been enacted. </sup></sup>  Retention and relocation bonuses for the Federal Bureau of Investigation

    (a) __Authority.—__ 

    The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, may pay, on a case-by-case basis, a bonus under this section to an employee of the Bureau if—

        (1)

            (A) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the Bureau for the employee’s services makes it essential to retain the employee; and

            (B)

             the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation determines that, in the absence of such a bonus, the employee would be likely to leave—

                (i) the Federal service; or

                (ii) for a different position in the Federal service; or

        (2) the individual is subject to a mobility agreement and is transferred to a position in a different geographical area in which there is a shortage of critical skills (as determined by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation).

    (b) __Service Agreement.—__ 

    Payment of a bonus under this section is contingent upon the employee entering into a written service agreement with the Bureau to complete a period of service with the Bureau. Such agreement shall include—

        (1) the period of service the individual shall be required to complete in return for the bonus; and

        (2) the conditions under which the agreement may be terminated before the agreed-upon service period has been completed, and the effect of the termination, including requirements for a bonus recipient’s repayment of a bonus in circumstances determined by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

    (c) __Limitation on Authority.—__ 

    A bonus paid under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the employee’s annual rate of basic pay. The bonus may be paid in a lump sum or installments linked to completion of periods of service.

    (d) __Impact on Basic Pay.—__ 

    A bonus paid under this section is not part of the basic pay of an employee for any purpose.
