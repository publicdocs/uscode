    In paragraph (2), the words “Members of Congress” are substituted for “the President of the Senate or Members of Congress” in view of the definition of “Member of Congress” in section 2106.

    The first sentence of [section 9 of the Act of June 9, 1949][/us/act/1949-06-09/s9], which repealed the Subsistence Act of 1926 and the Auto Mileage Act of February 14, 1931, is omitted as executed.

    The first proviso of former section 842, which related to appropriation Acts for the years 1949 and 1950, is omitted as obsolete. The remainder of former section 842, other than the parenthetical expressions, is omitted as executed and existing rights are preserved by technical section 8.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
