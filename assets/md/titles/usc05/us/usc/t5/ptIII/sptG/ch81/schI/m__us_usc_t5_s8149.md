    The words “administration and” are added for clarity.

    Administration of this subchapter was transferred to the Secretary of Labor by section 1 of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 19, [64 Stat. 1271][/us/stat/64/1271] (see section 8145).

    The first sentence of section 2 of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 19 is omitted as executed. The word “employees” is coextensive with and substituted for “employees of the Federal Government or of the District of Columbia” in view of the definition of “employee” in section 8101.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
