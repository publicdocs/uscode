## § 6366. Eligibility for leave recipients

    (a)

     An employee is eligible to be a leave recipient if such employee—

        (1) experiences a medical emergency and submits an application pursuant to section 6367(a); and

        (2)

            (A) contributes the minimum number of hours as required under subsection (b) of accrued or accumulated annual leave to the leave bank of the employing agency of such employee, in the leave year (beginning in and including any part of a leave year in which such leave bank is established) that such employee submits an application to be a leave recipient under section 6367(a); and

            (B) such contribution is made before such employee submits an application under section 6367(a).

    (b)

        (1)

         An employee shall contribute the minimum number of hours required under subsection (a)(2)(A), if such employee is an employee—

            (A) for less than 3 years of service and contributes a minimum of 4 hours;

            (B) for between 3 years and less than 15 years of service and contributes a minimum of 6 hours; or

            (C) for 15 years or more of service and contributes a minimum of 8 hours.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Leave Bank Board of an agency, after consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, may—

            (A) reduce the minimum number of hours required under paragraph (1) for any leave year, if such Board determines there is a surplus of leave in the leave bank; and

            (B) increase the number of minimum hours required under paragraph (1) for the succeeding leave year, in any leave year in which the Board determines there is a shortage of leave in the leave bank.

    (c) An employee shall meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(A) if such employee contributes the minimum number of hours as required under subsection (b) of accrued or accumulated annual leave to the leave bank with which such employee submits an application to be a leave recipient under section 6367(a).

    (d) The provisions of subsection (a) may not be construed to limit the amount of the voluntary contribution of annual leave to a leave bank, which does not exceed the limitations of section 6365(b).
