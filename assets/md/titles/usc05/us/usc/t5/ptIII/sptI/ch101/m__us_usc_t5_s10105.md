            (B) for a different position in the Federal service.

    (b) __Service Agreement.—__ 

    Payment of a bonus under this section is contingent upon the employee entering into a written service agreement with the Agency to complete a period of service with the Agency. Such agreement shall include—

        A bonus under this section shall be paid in the form of a lump-sum payment and shall not be considered to be part of basic pay.

        (2)

         may not be paid to an individual who is appointed to or holds—

            (A) a position to which an individual is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;

            (B) a position in the Senior Executive Service as a noncareer appointee (as defined in section 3132(a)); or

            (C) a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character; and

        (3) upon completion of the strategic human capital plan, shall be paid in accordance with that plan.

    (e) __Termination of Authority.—__ 

    The authority to grant bonuses under this section shall expire 5 years after the date of enactment of this chapter.

    (f) __Reports.—__

        (2) __Contents.—__ 

        Each report submitted under this subsection shall include, with respect to the period covered by such report, a description of how the authority to pay bonuses under this section was used by the Agency, including, with respect to each such agency—
