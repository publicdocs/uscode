## § 8504. Assignment of Federal service and wages

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, the Federal service and Federal wages of a Federal employee shall be assigned to the State in which he had his last official station in Federal service before the filing of his first claim for compensation for the benefit year. However—

    (1) if, at the time of filing his first claim, he resides in another State in which he performed, after the termination of his Federal service, service covered under the unemployment compensation law of the other State, his Federal service and Federal wages shall be assigned to the other State; and

    (2) if his last official station in Federal service, before filing his first claim, was outside the United States, his Federal service and Federal wages shall be assigned to the State where he resides at the time he files his first claim.

    This section also amends [5 U.S.C. 8504][/us/usc/t5/s8504] to eliminate certain provisions that are now obsolete. The obsolete provisions were based on [section 542(b)(2) of the act of September 13, 1960][/us/act/1960-09-13/s542/b/2], [74 Stat. 986][/us/stat/74/986], that amended section 1504 of the Social Security Act effective January 1, 1961, but only in the case of first claims filed before January 1, 1966. Any existing rights are preserved by section 7 of this bill.

L. 94–566][/us/pl/94/566] applicable with respect to benefit years beginning on or after later of Oct. 1, 1976, or first day of first week for which compensation becomes payable under an unemployment compensation law of Virgin Islands which is approved by Secretary of Labor under [section 3304(a) of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3304/a], Internal Revenue Code, see section 116(f)(3), set out as a note under [section 3304 of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3304].
