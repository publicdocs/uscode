    The last 20 words of former section 781 are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “competitive service” in section 2102 and the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 33 concerning examination and certification for and appointment in the competitive service.

    Administration of this subchapter was transferred to the Secretary of Labor by section 1 of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 19, [64 Stat. 1271][/us/stat/64/1271].

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
