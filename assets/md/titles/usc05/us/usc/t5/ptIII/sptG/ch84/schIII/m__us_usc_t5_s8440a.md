## § 8440a. Justices and judges

    (a)

        (1) A justice or judge of the United States as defined by [section 451 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s451] may elect to contribute an amount of such individual’s basic pay to the Thrift Savings Fund. Basic pay does not include an annuity or salary received by a justice or judge who has retired under section 371(a) or (b) or [section 372(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s372/a], United States Code.

        (2) An election may be made under paragraph (1) as provided under section 8432(b) for individuals subject to this chapter.

    (b)

        (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter VII shall apply with respect to justices and judges making contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund.

        (2) The amount contributed by a justice or judge for any pay period shall not exceed the maximum percentage of such justice’s or judge’s basic pay for such pay period allowable under section 8440f.

        (3) No contributions shall be made for the benefit of a justice or judge under [section 8432(c) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8432/c].

        (4) [Section 8433(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8433/b] applies with respect to elections available to any justice or judge who retires under section 371(a) or (b) or [section 372(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s372/a]. Retirement under section 371(a) or (b) or [section 372(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s372/a] is a separation from service for the purposes of subchapters III and VII of chapter 84 of this title.

        (5) [Section 8433(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8433/b] applies to any justice or judge who resigns without having met the age and service requirements set forth in [section 371(c) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s371/c].

        (6) The provisions of [section 8351(b)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8351/b/5] shall govern the rights of spouses of justices or judges contributing to the Thrift Savings Fund under this section.

        (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (4) and (5), if any justice or judge retires under subsection (a) or (b) of section 371 or [section 372(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s372/a], or resigns without having met the age and service requirements set forth under [section 371(c) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s371/c], and such justice’s or judge’s nonforfeitable account balance is less than an amount that the Executive Director prescribes by regulation, the Executive Director shall pay the nonforfeitable account balance to the participant in a single payment.
