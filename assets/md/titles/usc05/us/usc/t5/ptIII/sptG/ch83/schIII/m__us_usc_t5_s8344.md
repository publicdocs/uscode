## § 8344. Annuities and pay on reemployment

    (a)

     If an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund, except—

        (1) a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of his recovery or restoration of earning capacity;

        (2) an annuitant whose annuity, based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency), is terminated under subsection (b) of this section;

        (3) an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (c) of this section; or

        (4) a Member receiving annuity from the Fund;

        becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, his service on and after the date he is so employed is covered by this subchapter. Deductions for the Fund may not be withheld from his pay unless the individual elects to have such deductions withheld under subparagraph (A). An amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under [section 5551 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5551]. The amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis, except as President, for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, in employment not excluding him from coverage under section 8331(1)(i) or (ii) of this title—

        (A) deductions for the Fund may be withheld from his pay (if the employee so elects), and his annuity on termination of employment is increased by an annuity computed under section 8339(a), (b), (d), (e), (h), (i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply based on the period of employment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during that employment; and

        (B) his lump-sum credit may not be reduced by annuity paid during that employment.

        If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or [section 8339(k)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8339/k/2], the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) of this subsection is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under [section 8341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b] is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under such subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under such subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that he does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. If the described employment of the annuitant continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, he may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (A) of this subsection, to deposit in the Fund (to the extent deposits or deductions have not otherwise been made) an amount computed under [section 8334(c) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/c] covering that employment and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed and the described employment had continued for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, the person entitled to survivor annuity under [section 8341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b] may elect to deposit in the Fund and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter.

    (b) If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause or charges on misconduct or delinquency) is reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment.

    (c) If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, is appointed by the President to a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or is elected as a Member, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. Upon separation from such position, an individual whose annuity is so terminated is entitled to have his rights redetermined under this subchapter, except that the amount of the annuity resulting from such redetermination shall be at least equal to the amount of the terminated annuity plus any increases under [section 8340 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8340] occurring after the termination and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity.

    (d)

     If a Member receiving annuity from the Fund becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, annuity payments are discontinued during the employment and resumed on termination of the employment in the amount equal to the sum of the amount of the annuity the member was receiving immediately before the commencement of the employment and the amount of the increases which would have been made in the amount of the annuity under [section 8340 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8340] during the period of the employment if the annuity had been payable during that period, except that—

        (1)

         the retired Member or Member separated with title to immediate or deferred annuity, who serves at any time after separation as a Member in an appointive position in which he is subject to this subchapter, is entitled, if he so elects, to have his Member annuity computed or recomputed as if the service had been performed before his separation as a Member and the annuity as so computed or recomputed is effective—

            (A) the day Member annuity commences; or

            (B) the day after the date of separation from the appointive position;

            whichever is later;

        (2)

         if the retired Member becomes employed after December 31, 1958, in an appointive position on an intermittent-service basis—

            (A) his annuity continues during the employment and is not increased as a result of service performed during that employment;

            (B) retirement deductions may not be withheld from his pay;

            (C) an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under [section 5551 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5551]; and

            (D) the amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund;

        (3) if the retired Member becomes employed after December 31, 1958, in an appointive position without pay on a full-time or substantially full-time basis, his annuity continues during the employment and is not increased as a result of service performed during the employment; and

        (4) if the retired Member takes office as Member and gives notice as provided by [section 8331(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8331/2], his service as Member during that period shall be credited in determining his right to and the amount of later annuity.

    (e) This section does not apply to an individual appointed to serve as a Governor of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.

    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, if an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund, except a Member receiving annuity from the Fund, becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by [section 451 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s451], annuity payments are discontinued during such employment and are resumed in the same amount upon resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge.

    (g) A former employee or a former Member who becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by [section 451 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s451], may, at any time prior to resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge, apply for and be paid, in accordance with [section 8342(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8342/a], the amount (if any) by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid, notwithstanding the time limitation contained in such section for filing an application for payment.

    (h)

        (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to any annuitant receiving an annuity from the Fund while such annuitant is employed, during any period described in [section 5532(f)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5532/f/2] (as in effect before the repeal of that section by [section 651(a) of Public Law 106–65][/us/pl/106/65/s651/a]) or any portion thereof, under the administrative authority of the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, or the Secretary of Defense to perform duties in the operation of the air traffic control system or to train other individuals to perform such duties: Provided, however, That the amount such an annuitant may receive in pay, excluding premium pay, in any pay period when aggregated with the annuity payable during that same period shall not exceed the rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the words “except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under [section 61b of this title][/us/usc/t5/s61b]” are omitted as unnecessary as section 5551(a) provides that a “lump-sum leave payment is considered pay for taxation purposes only”.

    In subsection (a), the words “after September 30, 1956” are substituted for “hereafter” on authority of [§ 406 of the Act of July 31, 1956, ch. 804][/us/act/1956-07-31/ch804/s406], [70 Stat. 761][/us/stat/70/761]. In paragraph (2), the words “other than an automatic separation” are substituted for “excluding a separation under the automatic separation provisions of this chapter”. In the third sentence, the words “and this provision concerning the lump-sum leave payments shall also be effective in the case of each retired employee separated from reemployment after December 15, 1953, and before the effective date of the Civil Service Retirement Act Amendments of 1956” are omitted as executed, and any existing rights are preserved by technical section 8. In the fourth sentence, the words “except as President” are added to preserve the exception stated in former section 2252(b). In the penultimate sentence, the words “after October 3, 1961” are substituted for “on or after October 4, 1961”. In the last sentence, the words “in any manner” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b), the words “receiving annuity from the Fund” are substituted for “heretofore or hereafter retired under this chapter”. The word “hereafter” is omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (1)(B), the words “the day after” are substituted for “the first day of the month following” on authority of former section 2264(b), which is carried into section 8345(b). In paragraph (1), former clause (C) is omitted as obsolete. In paragraph (2)(D), the words “of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

    In subsection (a), the words “after July 11, 1960” are substituted for “on or after July 12, 1960.” In subsection (b)(1), the amendment is made for consistency within the subchapter.

    In the codification of [5 U.S.C. 8344][/us/usc/t5/s8344] by [Public Law 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], the words “except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under [section 61b of this title][/us/usc/t5/s61b]” were omitted from the third sentence of subsection (a) and from subsection (b)(2)(C) on the basis that they were unnecessary since former [5 U.S.C. 61b][/us/usc/t5/s61b] \[now codified as [5 U.S.C. 5551(a)][/us/usc/t5/s5551/a]\] provided that a lump-sum leave payment was considered pay for taxation purposes only. This amendment restores to [5 U.S.C. 8344][/us/usc/t5/s8344] the language that was so omitted to conform to the source statute (section 13 of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended) and in recognition that the language was expressly placed in the source statute to overcome certain decisions of the Comptroller General of the United States (see 28 Comp. Gen. 294; 33 id. 591, and 36 id. 209).
