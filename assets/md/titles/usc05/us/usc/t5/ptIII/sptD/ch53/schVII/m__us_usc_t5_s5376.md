         Subject to such regulations as the Office of Personnel Management prescribes, the head of the agency concerned shall fix the rate of basic pay for any position within such agency to which this section applies. A rate fixed under this section shall be—

            (A) not less than 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS–15 of the General Schedule; and

            (B) subject to paragraph (3), not greater than the rate of basic pay payable for level III of the Executive Schedule.

        (3) In the case of an agency which has a performance appraisal system which, as designed and applied, is certified under section 5307(d) as making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance, paragraph (1)(B) shall apply as if the reference to “level III” were a reference to “level II”.

        (4) No employee may suffer a reduction in pay by reason of transfer from an agency with an applicable maximum rate of pay prescribed under paragraph (3) to an agency with an applicable maximum rate of pay prescribed under paragraph (1)(B).
