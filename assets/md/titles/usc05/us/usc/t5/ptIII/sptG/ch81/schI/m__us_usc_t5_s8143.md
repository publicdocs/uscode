## § 8143. Job Corps enrollees; volunteers in service to America

    (a)

     Subject to the provisions of this subsection, this subchapter applies to an enrollee in the Job Corps, except that compensation for disability does not begin to accrue until the day after the date on which the injured enrollee is terminated. In administering this subchapter for an enrollee covered by this subsection—

        (1) the monthly pay of an enrollee is deemed that received at the minimum rate for GS–2;

        (2) [section 8113(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8113/a] applies to an enrollee; and

        (3) “performance of duty” does not include an act of an enrollee while absent from his assigned post of duty, except while participating in an activity (including an activity while on pass or during travel to or from the post of duty) authorized by or under the direction and supervision of the Job Corps.

    (b) This subchapter applies to a volunteer in service to America who receives either a living allowance or a stipend under part A of subchapter VIII of chapter 34 of title 42, with respect to that service and training, to the same extent as enrollees of the Job Corps under subsection (a) of this section. However, for the purpose of the computation described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, the monthly pay of a volunteer is deemed that received at the minimum rate for GS–5 of the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332], United States Code.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “in the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act” are omitted as unnecessary since that act is codified in that subchapter of title 5, United States Code, in which section 8143 is a part. The word “his” is substituted for “his or hers” on authority of [1 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t1/s1]. The words “Job Corps” are substituted for “Corps” on authority of [42 U.S.C. 2712][/us/usc/t42/s2712].

    In subsection (b), the words “in service to America” are inserted after “volunteer” in two places for clarity. The words “subsection (a)(2) of this section” are substituted for “paragraph (2)(B) of section 106(c)” to reflect the codification of that paragraph in title 5. The words “at the minimum rate for GS–7” are substituted for “under the entrance salary for GS–7 of the General Schedule for section 5332, title 5, United States Code” to conform to the style of title 5.
