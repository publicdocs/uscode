## § 3583. Computations

    A computation under this subchapter before reemployment is made in the same manner as if the employee had received basic pay, or basic pay plus additional pay in the case of a Congressional employee, at the rate at which it would have been payable had the employee continued in the position in which he was serving at the time of transfer.
