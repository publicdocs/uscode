    In subsection (a), the definitions of “uniformed services” and “armed forces” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitions in section 2101. The definition of “civilian office” is omitted as unnecessary as subsection (b) of this section states the application of this subchapter.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “preference eligible employee” are coextensive with and substituted for “employee \* \* \* included under section 2 of this Act” in view of the definition of preference eligible in section 2108. In paragraph (3)(C), the words “on November 30, 1964, he was employed in a position to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he continued to be so employed” are substituted for “immediately prior to the effective date of this subsection, he was employed in a civilian office to which this Act applies and, on and after such date, he continues to be employed in any such office”.

    Subsection (b) is supplied on authority of sections 2, 12, and 20 of the [Act of June 27, 1944, ch. 287][/us/act/1944-06-27/ch287], [58 Stat. 387][/us/stat/58/387], 391, which are carried into this title.
