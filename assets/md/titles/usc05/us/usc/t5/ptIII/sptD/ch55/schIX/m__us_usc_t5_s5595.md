The Architect of the Capitol may prescribe regulations to effect the application and operation of this section to the agency specified in subsection (a)(1)(F) of this section.

For the purpose of subsection (b) (1) of this section, reemployment that causes severance pay to be discontinued is deemed employment continuous with that serving as the basis for severance pay.

    (e) If the employee dies before the end of the period covered by payments of severance pay, the payments of severance pay with respect to the employee shall be continued as if the employee were living and shall be paid on a pay period basis to the survivor of the employee in accordance with [section 5582(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5582/b].

    (f) Severance pay under this section is not a basis for payment, and may not be included in the basis for computation, of any other type of United States or District of Columbia Government benefits.

        (2)

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), payment of severance pay to a person referred to in paragraph (1) may be resumed upon any involuntary separation of the person from the position of employment in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality, not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency.

            (B) The period of service represented by an amount of severance pay repaid by an employee under subparagraph (A) shall be considered service for which severance pay has not been received by the employee under this section.

    The definition in subsection (a)(2) continues the application of the section to only civilian officers and employees, and does not encompass members of the uniformed services as they are not “employed” in or under an agency.

    In subsection (a)(2)(iv), the words “subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title” are substituted for “the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended” to reflect the codification of the act in title 5 U.S.C. The words “employees as defined by [section 2105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2105]” are coextensive with and substituted for “Federal officers and employees”.

    In subsection (a)(2)(v), the words “subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title” are substituted for “the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act, as amended” to reflect the codification of the act in title 5, U.S.C.

    In subsection (b) the word “agency” is substituted for “department, independent establishment, corporation, or other governmental unit” to conform to the definition in subsection (a)(1). Subsection (b)(1) is substituted for 5 App. U.S.C. 1117(e).

    In subsection (e), the words “[section 5582(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5582/b]” are substituted for “the first section of the Act of August 3, 1950 ([5 U.S.C. 61f][/us/usc/t5/s61f])” to reflect the codification of the section in title 5, United States Code.
