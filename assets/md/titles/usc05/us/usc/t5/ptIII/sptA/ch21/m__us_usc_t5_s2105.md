    Subsection (a) is supplied to avoid the necessity of defining “employee” each time it appears in this title. The subsection is based on a definition worked out independently by the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor and in use by both for more than a decade.

    In subsection (b), the provisions of the source statutes which relate to credit for prior service and diminution of pay are executed, or, insofar as to be executed preserved by technical section 8.

    In subsection (d), the words “officer or” are omitted as included within “employee”.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, referred to in subsec. (c)(1)(C), is [act June 25, 1938, ch. 676][/us/act/1938-06-25/ch676], [52 Stat. 1060][/us/stat/52/1060], as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 8 (§ 201 et seq.) of Title 29, Labor.

    1996—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 104–201][/us/pl/104/201] inserted “who is” after “An individual” and “and whose employment in such a position began before October 1, 1996, and has been uninterrupted in such a position since that date” after “Academy dairy,”.

    1994—Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 103–424][/us/pl/103/424] added subsec. (f).

    1993—Subsec. (c)(1)(E). [Pub. L. 103–3][/us/pl/103/3] added subpar. (E).

    1990—Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 101–508, § 7202(b)(1)][/us/pl/101/508/s7202/b/1], amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: “laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in [section 8332(b)(16) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8332/b/16], and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or”.

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 101–508, § 7202(b)(2)][/us/pl/101/508/s7202/b/2], inserted “(except to the extent specifically provided therein)” after “chapter 84”.

    1986—Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 99–638][/us/pl/99/638] inserted “of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in [section 8332(b)(16) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8332/b/16],”.

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 99–335][/us/pl/99/335] substituted “chapter 81, chapter 84,” for “chapter 81”.

    1979—Subsec. (a)(1)(F). [Pub. L. 96–54, § 2(a)(5)][/us/pl/96/54/s2/a/5], substituted “an adjutant” for “the adjutants” and struck out “, United States Code” after “32”.

    Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 96–54, § 2(a)(6)][/us/pl/96/54/s2/a/6], amended subsec. (c)(1) in same manner as amendment by [section 703(c)(2) of Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454/s703/c/2]. See 1978 Amendment note set out below.

    1978—Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454] substituted “7204” for “7154”, and “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission”. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of [Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454] appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend [section 3302(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3302/2]. However, the amendments specified by [Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(1)][/us/pl/95/454/s703/c/1] and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by [Pub. L. 95–454, § 703(c)(2)][/us/pl/95/454/s703/c/2] was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to [section 3302(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3302/2] as the probable intent of Congress.

    1972—Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 92–392][/us/pl/92/392] substituted “laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 and sections 5550 and 7154 of this title)” for “laws”.

    1970—Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] added subsec. (e).

    1968—Subsec. (a)(1)(F). [Pub. L. 90–486][/us/pl/90/486] added subpar. (F).

 __Effective Date of 1996 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 104–201, div. A, title III, § 370(e)][/us/pl/104/201/s370/e], Sept. 23, 1996, [110 Stat. 2499][/us/stat/110/2499], provided that:
