## § 6328. Absence in connection with funerals of fellow Federal law enforcement officers

    A Federal law enforcement officer or a Federal firefighter may be excused from duty without loss of, or reduction in, pay or leave to which such officer is otherwise entitled, or credit for time or service, or performance or efficiency rating, to attend the funeral of a fellow Federal law enforcement officer or Federal firefighter, who was killed in the line of duty. When so excused from duty, attendance at such service shall for the purposes of [section 1345(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1345/a], be considered to be an official duty of the officer or firefighter.

(Added [Pub. L. 103–329, title VI, § 642][/us/pl/103/329/s642], Sept. 30, 1994, [108 Stat. 2432][/us/stat/108/2432], § 6327; renumbered § 6328, [Pub. L. 106–56, § 1(c)(1)][/us/pl/106/56/s1/c/1], Sept. 24, 1999, [113 Stat. 407][/us/stat/113/407].)

 __Codification__ 

    [Section 642 of Pub. L. 103–329][/us/pl/103/329/s642], which directed that this section be added “following the word ‘Forces’ in section 6326” was executed by adding the section after section 6327, as added by [section 629(a)(1) of Pub. L. 103–329][/us/pl/103/329/s629/a/1], to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—[Pub. L. 106–56][/us/pl/106/56] renumbered [section 6327 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s6327] as this section.
