    In paragraph (1), the word “agency” is substituted for “department”. Reference to the “General Accounting Office” is omitted as included in “independent establishment” because of the definition in section 104.

    In paragraph (2)(B), the words “in the Department of Commerce” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In paragraph (6)(C), the word “agency” is omitted as unnecessary and to avoid confusion with the word “agency” defined by paragraph (1).

    In paragraph (6)(E), the words “individuals other than civilian or military personnel of the Government” are substituted for “an individual not a civilian or military officer or employee of the Government of the United States or of the municipal government of the District of Columbia” to conform to paragraph (5).

    The definition of “Commission” in former section 2302(4) is omitted as unnecessary as the title “Civil Service Commission” is fully set out the first time it is used in each section of this chapter.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
