Any member of the Panel may be removed by the President.

        (4) The Panel may appoint an Executive Director and any other individuals it may from time to time find necessary for the proper performance of its duties. Each member of the Panel who is not an employee (as defined in [section 2105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2105]) is entitled to pay at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay then currently paid under the General Schedule for each day he is engaged in the performance of official business of the Panel, including travel time, and is entitled to travel expenses as provided under [section 5703 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5703].
