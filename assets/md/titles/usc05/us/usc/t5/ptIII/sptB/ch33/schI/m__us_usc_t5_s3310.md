    The words “in the competitive service” are added for clarity. The reference to “examinations held prior to December 31, 1954, for positions of apprentices” is omitted as obsolete. Application of this section to the excepted service in the executive branch and to the government of the District of Columbia, as provided in former section 858, is carried into section 3320.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
