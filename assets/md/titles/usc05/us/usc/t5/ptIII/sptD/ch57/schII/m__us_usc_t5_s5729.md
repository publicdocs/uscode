        (1) he has acquired eligibility for that transportation; or

        (2) the public interest requires the return of the immediate family for compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature, such as may involve physical or mental health, death of a member of the immediate family, or obligation imposed by authority or circumstances over which the individual has no control.

     Under regulations prescribed under [section 5738 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5738], an agency shall reimburse from its appropriations an employee whose post of duty is outside the continental United States for the proper transportation expenses of returning his immediate family and his household goods and personal effects to the United States, when—

        (1) their return was made at the expense of the employee before his return and for other than reasons of public interest; and

        (2) he acquires eligibility for those transportation expenses.

    (c) This section does not apply to appropriations for the Foreign Service of the United States.

    The first 14 words of subsections (a) and (b), and subsection (c), are added on authority of former section 73b–3(a) (less 3d–6th provisos), which is carried into section 5722. The words “household effects” and “household goods” in the 5th and 6th provisos of former section 73b–3(a) are changed to “household goods and personal effects” for clarity and consistency in the use of the words elsewhere in this subchapter.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

    1998—Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 105–264][/us/pl/105/264] struck out “or its territories or possessions” after “to the United States”.

    1996—Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 104–201][/us/pl/104/201] substituted “Under regulations prescribed under [section 5738 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5738]” for “Under such regulations as the President may prescribe”.

 __Effective Date of 1996 Amendment__
