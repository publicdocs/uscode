## § 8115. Determination of wage-earning capacity

    (a)

     In determining compensation for partial disability, except permanent partial disability compensable under sections 8107–8109 of this title, the wage-earning capacity of an employee is determined by his actual earnings if his actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings of the employee do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity or if the employee has no actual earnings, his wage-earning capacity as appears reasonable under the circumstances is determined with due regard to—

        (1) the nature of his injury;

        (2) the degree of physical impairment;

        (3) his usual employment;

        (4) his age;

        (5) his qualifications for other employment;

        (6) the availability of suitable employment; and

        (7) other factors or circumstances which may affect his wage-earning capacity in his disabled condition.

    (b) [Section 8114(d) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8114/d] is applicable in determining the wage-earning capacity of an employee after the beginning of partial disability.
