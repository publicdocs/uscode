 __References in Text__ 

    The effective date of the amendments made by section 1106 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, referred to in subsec.

L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136], which enacted this section. [Pub. L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136] does not contain a section 1106, and the provisions appearing in section 1106 of H.R. 1588, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, as passed by the House of Representatives on May 22, 2003, were contained in [section 1125 of Pub.

L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136/s1125/c], set out as an Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note under [section 5304 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5304].

    The date of the enactment of that Act, referred to in subsec. (a), is the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, [Pub. L. 108–136][/us/pl/108/136], which was approved Nov. 24, 2003.
