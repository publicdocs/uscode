    In subsection (a)(1), the term “an Executive agency” is substituted for “executive department of the Government of the United States”, “agency or independent establishment in the executive branch of such Government”, “corporation owned or controlled by such Government”, and “the General Accounting Office” to conform to the definition in [5 U.S.C. 105][/us/usc/t5/s105].

    In subsection (b), the word “employee” is substituted for “civilian officer or employee” and “such officer or employee” to conform to the definition in [5 U.S.C. 2105][/us/usc/t5/s2105]. The words “on or after the date of enactment of this Act” and “taken prior to, on, or after the date of enactment of his Act” are omitted as executed and unnecessary, since title 5 is restated prospectively and as any existing rights are preserved by section 7 of this bill.

    In subsection (c), the word “employees” is substituted for “officers and employees” to conform to the definition in [5 U.S.C. 2105][/us/usc/t5/s2105].
