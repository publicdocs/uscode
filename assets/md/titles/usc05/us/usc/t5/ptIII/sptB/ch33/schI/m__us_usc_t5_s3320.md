## § 3320. Excepted service; government of the District of Columbia; selection

    The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service in the executive branch and in the government of the District of Columbia from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308–3318 of this title.

    Former sections 858 and 869 are combined and restated for clarity and to conform to section 3318(a). The word “authority” is substituted for “officer” in recognition of the several appointing authorities named in section 2105(a)(1). The words “shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the expected service in the executive branch and in the government of the District of Columbia from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308–3318 of this title” are substituted for “In the unclassified Federal, and District of Columbia, civil service, and in all other positions and employment hereinbefore referred to in (c) of [section 851 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s851] . . . shall make selection from the qualified applicants in accordance with the provisions of this chapter”. The reference to the excepted service “in the executive branch” is substituted for the exception of the legislative and judicial branches in former section 869. Former section 869 did not prohibit the application of those provisions of the Act of June 27, 1944, which relate to the competitive service in the legislative or judicial branch by reason of the specific provisions of [section 311 of the Act of June 10, 1921][/us/act/1921-06-10/s311], as amended ([31 U.S.C. 52][/us/usc/t31/s52]); [28 U.S.C. 602][/us/usc/t28/s602]; and Executive Order No. 67 of June 13, 1895. The reference to appointments of postmasters is omitted from this section since those referred to are in the competitive service. The application of former section 869 to the remainder of the Act of June 27, 1944, is covered by the sections into which the remainder is carried (see Table I).

    This section merely continues, and does not in any way change, the requirements in former section 858 relative to the selection of applicants for positions in the excepted service. Under this section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies having positions in the excepted service will continue to fill those positions in the same manner that they have been filled under former section 858. Such excepted appointments are appointments authorized to be made without regard to the statutes, rules, and regulations governing appointments in the competitive service and this is not changed.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

    [Pub. L. 93–198, title VII][/us/pl/93/198/tVII], § 734, Dec. 24, 1973, [87 Stat. 823][/us/stat/87/823], authorized the United States Civil Service Commission to advise and assist the District of Columbia Mayor and Council in the further development of the merit system or systems required by the District of Columbia charter, which was approved on May 7, 1974, and authorized the Commission to enter into agreements with the District government to make available its registers of eligibles as a recruiting source to fill District positions as needed, with the costs of any specific services furnished by the Civil Service Commission to be compensated for under the provisions of section 685a of former Title 31, Money and Finance \[[31 U.S.C. 1537][/us/usc/t31/s1537]\].
