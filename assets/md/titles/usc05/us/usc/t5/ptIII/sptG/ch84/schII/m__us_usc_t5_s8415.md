## § 8415. Computation of basic annuity

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual’s average pay multiplied by such individual’s total service.

    (b) The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to a Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Member or Congressional employee, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17⁄10 percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of such service.

    (c) The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Congressional employee or Member, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17⁄10 percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of such service.

    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annuity of an individual described in subsection (b) or (c) who is a revised annuity employee or a further revised annuity employee shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual described in subsection (a).

    (e)

     The annuity of an employee retiring under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412 or under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 8425 is—

        (1) 17⁄10 percent of that individual’s average pay multiplied by so much of such individual’s total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus

        (2) 1 percent of that individual’s average pay multiplied by so much of such individual’s total service as exceeds 20 years.

    (f)

     The annuity of an air traffic controller or former air traffic controller retiring under section 8412(a) is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has at least 5 years of service in any combination as—

        (1) an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);

        (2) a first level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i); or

        (3) a second level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);

        so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to such type of service shall be computed by multiplying 1 7/10 percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of such service.

    (g)

        (1)

         In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis—

            (A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and

            (B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee’s actual service, as determined by prorating the employee’s total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.

        (2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

    (h)

        (1) The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is computed in accordance with applicable provisions of this section, except that the annuity shall be reduced by five-twelfths of 1 percent for each full month by which the commencement date of the annuity precedes the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the employee or Member.

        (2)

            (A) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) if the employee or Member would satisfy the age and service requirements for title to an annuity under section 8412(a), (b), (d)(2), (e)(2), or (f)(2), determined as if the employee or Member had, as of the date of separation, attained the age specified in subparagraph (B).

            (B) A determination under subparagraph (A) shall be based on how old the employee or Member will be as of the date on which the annuity under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is to commence.

    (i)

        (1) In applying subsection (a) with respect to an employee under paragraph (2), the percentage applied under such subsection shall be 1.1 percent, rather than 1 percent.

        (2)

         This subsection applies in the case of an employee who—

            (A) retires entitled to an annuity under section 8412; and

            (B) at the time of the separation on which entitlement to the annuity is based, is at least 62 years of age and has completed at least 20 years of service;

            but does not apply in the case of a Congressional employee, military technician (dual status), law enforcement officer, member of the Supreme Court Police, firefighter, nuclear materials courier, air traffic controller, or customs and border protection officer  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period. </sup></sup> 

    (j) The annuity of a Member who has served in a position in the executive branch for which the rate of basic pay was reduced for the duration of the service of the Member in that position to remove the impediment to the appointment of the Member imposed by article I, section 6, clause 2 of the Constitution, shall, subject to a deposit in the Fund as provided under section 8422(g), be computed as though the rate of basic pay which would otherwise have been in effect during that period of service had been in effect.

    (k)

        (1) For purposes of this subsection, the term “physicians comparability allowance” refers to an amount described in section 8331(3)(H).

        (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no part of a physicians comparability allowance shall be treated as basic pay for purposes of any computation under this section unless, before the date of the separation on which entitlement to annuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a Government physician (whether performed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection).

        (3) If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows:

<table>

          <tr>

            <td> 

        If the total amount of service

         performed, on or after the date of

         the enactment of this subsection,

         as a Government physician is:  </td>

            <td> 

        Then, the percentage allowable is:  </td>

  </tr>

          <tr>

            <td> 

        Less than 2 years  </td>

            <td>

        At least 2 but less than 4 years  </td>

        At least 8 years  </td>

            <td> 

        100.  </td>

  </tr>

        </table>

        (4)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 100 percent of all amounts received as a physicians comparability allowance shall, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this subsection) for purposes of computing—

            (A) an annuity under section 8452; and

            (B) a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service.

    (l)

     The annuity of an employee retiring under this chapter with service credited under section 8411(b)(6) shall be reduced by the amount necessary to ensure that the present value of the annuity payable to the employee under this subchapter is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity that would be payable to the employee under this subchapter if it were computed—

        (1) on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8411(b)(6); and

        (2) assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee.

        The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.

    (m)

        (1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires from the position of a registered nurse with the Veterans Health Administration on an immediate annuity, or dies while employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an annuity, includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit of that employee under a formal leave system, except that such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter.

        (2)

            (A) Except as provided in paragraph (1), in computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes the applicable percentage of the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system and for which days the employee has not received payment, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 under section 6301(2)(x) through (xiii), the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.

            (B)

             For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percentage” means—

                (i) 50 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this paragraph and ending on December 31, 2013; and

                (ii) 100 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring after December 31, 2013.

    (n) In the case of any annuity computation under this section that includes, in the aggregate, at least 2 months of credit under section 8411(d) for any period while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81, the percentage otherwise applicable under this section for that period so credited shall be increased by 1 percentage point.
