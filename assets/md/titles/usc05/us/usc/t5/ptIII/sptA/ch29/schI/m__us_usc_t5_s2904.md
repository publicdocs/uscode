    The section is restated to combine former sections 16a(a) (1st 9 words after last comma) and 20. The prohibition is restated in positive form. The words “officer” and “clerk” are omitted as included in “employee”. Reference to oaths taken on promotion is omitted as unnecessary.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
