    Sections are consolidated as R.S. § 1765 includes the scope of R.S. § 170, R.S. § 1764, and the Act of June 20, 1874, as amended. So much of R.S. § 1764 as relates to details is covered by section 5535.

    R.S. § 170 was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343], § 201(d), as added [Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412][/us/act/1949-08-10/ch412], § 4, [63 Stat. 579][/us/stat/63/579] (former [5 U.S.C. 171–1][/us/usc/t5/s171–1]), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act \[National Security Act of 1947\], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from his \[sic\] title but is not repealed.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
