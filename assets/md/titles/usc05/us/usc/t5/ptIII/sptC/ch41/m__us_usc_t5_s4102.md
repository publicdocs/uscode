    In subsection (a)(1), the exception for the President and Vice President is omitted as surplusage as these elected officers are not employed in or under an agency and thus are not included in the definition of “employee” in section 4101(2).

    In subsection (a)(1)(C), the words “as defined by [section 231(a) of Title 37][/us/usc/t37/s231/a]” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “uniformed services” in section 2101(b). The words “[section 204 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s204]” are substituted for “sections 232–234, 235, 236, 237, 238, and 239 of Title 37” on authority of [section 12(b) of the Act of Sept. 7, 1962][/us/act/1962-09-07/s12/b], [Pub. L. 87–649][/us/pl/87/649], [76 Stat. 497][/us/stat/76/497].

    In subsection (a)(2)(B), the words “by the President” are coextensive with and substituted for “by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate or by the President alone”.

    In subsection (b)(1), reference to “section 21, and section 22” is omitted as unnecessary since the sections are not carried into this title, but are scheduled for repeal, see Table II.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __Amendments__ 

    1979—Subsec. (a)(1)(C). [Pub. L. 96–54][/us/pl/96/54], § 2(a)(19), substituted “National Oceanic and Atmospheric” for “Environmental Science Services”.
