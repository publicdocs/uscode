## § 8110. Augmented compensation for dependents

    (a)

     For the purpose of this section, “dependent” means—

        (1)

         a wife, if—

            (A) she is a member of the same household as the employee;

            (B) she is receiving regular contributions from the employee for her support; or

            (C) the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to her support;

        (2)

         a husband, if—

            (A) he is a member of the same household as the employee; or

            (B) he is receiving regular contributions from the employee for his support; or

            (C) the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to his support;

        (3)

         an unmarried child, while living with the employee or receiving regular contributions from the employee toward his support, and who is—

            (A) under 18 years of age; or

            (B) over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support because of physical or mental disability; and

        (4) a parent, while wholly dependent on and supported by the employee.

        Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection, compensation payable for a child that would otherwise end because the child has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by [section 8101 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8101] at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries.

    (b)

     A disabled employee with one or more dependents is entitled to have his basic compensation for disability augmented—

        (1) at the rate of 8⅓ percent of his monthly pay if that compensation is payable under section 8105 or 8107(a) of this title; and

        (2) at the rate of 8⅓ percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity if that compensation is payable under [section 8106(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8106/a].
