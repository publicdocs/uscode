        (3) by the Chief Justice of the United States or his or her designee, in the case of an employee of the judicial branch.

    (b) In order to facilitate the settlement of the accounts of deceased employees, money due an employee at the time of his death shall be paid to the person or persons surviving at the date of death, in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by another person of amounts so paid:    First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee in a writing received in the employing agency before his death.

        Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee.

        Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee and descendants of deceased children by representation.

    Subsection (a) is restated for clarity. The word “officers” is omitted as included in “employee”.

    In subsection (b), so much of the first 35 words of former section 61f as states the application is carried into the definition of “employee” in section 5581(1). The word “officer” is omitted as included in “employee”.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 104–316][/us/pl/104/316] substituted “An employee may change or revoke a designation at any time under regulations promulgated—” for “An employee may change or revoke a designation at any time under such regulations as the Comptroller General of the United States may prescribe.” in introductory provisions and added pars. (1) to (3).
