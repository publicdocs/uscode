            (A) in the case of an employee, has the meaning provided under [section 5561(5) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5561/5]; and

            (A) any dependent of such person; and

            (B) any individual (other than a dependent under subparagraph (A)) who is a member of such person’s family or household.

    (b)

        (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a savings fund to which the head of an agency may allot all or any portion of the pay and allowances of any captive to the extent that such pay and allowances are not subject to an allotment under [section 5563 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5563] or any other provision of law.

        (2) Amounts so allotted to the savings fund shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with 3-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter. Such interest shall be compounded quarterly.

        (3) Amounts in the savings fund credited to a captive shall be considered as pay and allowances for purposes of [section 5563 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5563] and shall otherwise be subject to withdrawal under procedures which the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish.

        (6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) which is later denied under paragraph (3)(B) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of [section 3711 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3711].
