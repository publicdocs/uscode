    In subsection (a), the words “agency of the Government of the United States” are coextensive with and substituted for “departments and agencies including Government-owned and controlled corporations” to avoid confusion with the definitions in sections 101–105.

    In subsection (d) the word “appropriate” in the phrase “appropriate comment and recommendations” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “to the head of the agency concerned” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (e), the substance of the definition of “physician” in former section 790 is substituted for the reference to that section.

    In subsection (f)(2) and (3), the words “Canal Zone Government” and “Panama Canal Company” are substituted for “Panama Canal” and “Panama Railroad”, respectively, on the authority of the [Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049][/us/act/1950-09-26/ch1049], § 2(a), [64 Stat. 1038][/us/stat/64/1038].

    The last proviso of the first sentence of the Act of Aug. 8, 1946, is omitted as executed.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
