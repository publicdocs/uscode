    In subsection (a), the words “From and after February 24, 1931” are omitted as executed. The word “employee” is coextensive with and substituted for “civil employee of the United States” in view of the definition of “employee” in section 2105.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
