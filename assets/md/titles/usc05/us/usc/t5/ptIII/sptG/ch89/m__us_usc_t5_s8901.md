    The definition of “employee” in [section 2105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2105] is broad enough to cover the officers and employees covered by former section 3001 with the exception of a Member of Congress, the President, an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, an individual employed by Gallaudet College, a United States commissioner, and an Official Reporter of Debates of the Senate and an individual employed by him. The first five have been added in paragraphs (1)(B), (D), (E), (F), and (G). The latter are covered by the definition of “Congressional employee” in [section 2107 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2107] and are included by the addition of a Congressional employee in paragraph (1)(C).

    In paragraph (1)(ii), the words “the United States” are substituted for “a State of the United States or the District of Columbia”.

    Paragraph (1)(iv) is added for clarity.

    In paragraph (8), the words “before January 1, 1964” are substituted for “on or before December 31, 1963”.

    The definition of “Commission” in former section 3001(h) is omitted as unnecessary as the full title “Civil Service Commission” is set forth the first time it is used in a section.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
