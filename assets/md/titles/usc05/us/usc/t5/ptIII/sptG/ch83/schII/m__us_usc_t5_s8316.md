## § 8316. Refund of contributions and deposits

        (1) the amount, except employment taxes, contributed by the individual toward the annuity, less the amount previously refunded or paid as annuity benefits; and

        (2) deposits made under [section 1438 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s1438] or section 5 of the Uniformed Services Contingency Option Act of 1953 ([67 Stat. 504][/us/stat/67/504]) to provide the eligible beneficiary with annuity for any period, less the amount previously paid as retired pay benefits;

        shall be refunded, on appropriate application therefor—

        (A) to the individual;

        (B) if the individual is dead, to the beneficiary designated to receive refunds by or under the statute, regulation, or agreement under which the annuity, the benefits of which are denied under this subchapter, would have been payable; or

     A refund under subsection (a) of this section shall be made with interest at the rate and for the period provided under the statute, regulation, or agreement under which the annuity would have been payable. However, interest may not be computed—

        (1) if the individual was convicted of an offense named by [section 8312(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8312/b], or violated section 8314 or 8315(a)(1) of this title, for the period after the conviction or commission of the violation, or after September 1, 1954, whichever is later; or
