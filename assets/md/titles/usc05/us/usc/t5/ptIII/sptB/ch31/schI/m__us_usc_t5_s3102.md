    (b)

        (1)

         The head of each agency may employ one or more personal assistants who the head of the agency determines are necessary to enable a handicapped employee of that agency to perform the employee’s official duties and who shall serve without pay from the agency, without regard to—

            (B) that individual shall be considered an employee, but only for purposes of chapter 81 of this title (relating to compensation for injury) and sections 2671 through 2680 of title 28 (relating to tort claims).

    (e) This section may not be held or considered to prevent or limit in any way the assignment to a handicapped employee (including a blind or deaf employee) by an agency of clerical or secretarial assistance, at the expense of the agency under statutes and regulations currently applicable at the time, if that assistance normally is provided, or authorized to be provided, in that manner under currently applicable statutes and regulations.

    In subsection (a)(1), the word “agency” is substituted for “department”. The words “Executive agency” are coextensive with and substituted for “each executive department of the Federal Government, each agency or independent establishment in the executive branch of such Government, each corporation wholly owned or controlled by such Government, and the General Accounting Office” in view of the definition of “Executive agency” in section 105.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “individual employed” are substituted for “employee” so as to include individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia who are not employees as defined by section 2105.

    In subsection (b), the word “may” is substituted for “is authorized” and the words “in his discretion” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the permissive nature of the authority. The words “in the provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service” are substituted for “the civil service rules”. The words “[section 209 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s209]” are substituted for “[section 1914 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1914]” on authority of the Act of Oct. 24, 1962, [Pub. L. 87–849][/us/pl/87/849], § 2, [76 Stat. 1126][/us/stat/76/1126].

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
