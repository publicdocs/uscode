    In subsection (b), the reference to “subchapter I of chapter 57 of this title” is substituted for the reference to “the Standardized Government Travel Regulations and the provisions of the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926, as amended” as the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926 was repealed by section 9(a) of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 167][/us/stat/63/167], part of which appeared in former section 842 and is carried into section 5708, and as the authority for the Standardized Government Travel Regulations in former section 840 is carried into section 5707 of subchapter I of chapter 57.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
