    In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the words “training under this chapter” and “the training” are substituted for “training by, in, or through Government facilities or non-Government facilities under authority of this chapter” and “such training”, respectively.

    In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words “and the Standardized Government Travel Regulations” are omitted as included by the reference to “subchapter I of chapter 57 of this title”.

    In subsection (a)(2)(A) and (B), the words “sections 404 and 405 of title 37” and “sections 406 and 409 of title 37” are substituted for the references to “[section 253 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s253]” on authority of [section 12(b) of the Act of Sept. 7, 1962][/us/act/1962-09-07/s12/b], [Pub. L. 87–649][/us/pl/87/649], [76 Stat. 497][/us/stat/76/497].

    In subsection (a)(2)(B), the words “under [section 5724 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5724]” are substituted for “in accordance with [section 73b–1 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s73b–1], and Executive Order Numbered 9805, as amended” to reflect the codification of former section 73b–1 in this title and in view of the revocation of Executive Order No. 9805 by Executive Order No. 11012 of Mar. 27, 1962. The reference only to section 5724 is sufficient since that section contains the applicable substantive law, including the authority of the President to prescribe regulations.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
