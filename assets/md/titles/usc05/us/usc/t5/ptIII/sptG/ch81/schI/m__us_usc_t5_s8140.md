    (b) For the purpose of this section, an injury, disability, death, or illness of a member referred to in subsection (a) may be considered as incurred or contracted in line of duty only if the injury, disability, or death is incurred, or the illness is contracted, by the member during a period described in that subsection. Subject to review by the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the military department concerned (under regulations prescribed by that Secretary), shall determine whether an injury, disability, or death was incurred, or an illness was contracted, by a member in line of duty.
