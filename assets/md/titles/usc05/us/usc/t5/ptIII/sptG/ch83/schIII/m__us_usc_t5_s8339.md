## § 8339. Computation of annuity

    (a)

     Except as otherwise provided by this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is—

        (1) 1½ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed 5 years; plus

        (2) 1¾ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 5 years but does not exceed 10 years; plus

        (3) 2 percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 10 years.

        However, when it results in a larger annuity, 1 percent of his average pay plus $25 is substituted for the percentage specified by paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, or any combination thereof.

    (b)

     The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except, if he has had—

        (1) at least 5 years’ service as a Congressional employee or Member or any combination thereof; and

        (2) deductions withheld from his pay or has made deposit covering his last 5 years of civilian service;

        his annuity is computed with respect to his service as a Congressional employee, his military service not exceeding 5 years, and any Member service, by multiplying 2½ percent of his average pay by the years of that service.

    (c)

     The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except, if he has had at least 5 years’ service as a Member or Congressional employee or any combination thereof, his annuity is computed with respect to—

        (1) his service as a Member and so much of his military service as is creditable for the purpose of this paragraph; and

        (2) his Congressional employee service;

        by multiplying 2½ percent of his average pay by the years of that service.

    (d)

        (1)

         The annuity of an employee retiring under section 8335(b) or 8336(c) of this title is—

            (A) 2½ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus

            (B) 2 percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 20 years.

        (2)

         The annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter who was employed by the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government on September 30, 1979, is computed with respect to the period of continuous Panama Canal service from that date, disregarding any break in service of not more than 3 days, by adding—

            (A) 2½ percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as does not exceed 20 years; plus

            (B) 2 percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as exceeds 20 years.

        (3)

         The annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter who is employed by the Panama Canal Commission at any time during the period beginning October 1, 1990, and ending December 31, 1999, is computed, with respect to any period of service with the Panama Canal Commission, by adding—

            (A) 2½ percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as does not exceed 20 years; plus

            (B) 2 percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as exceeds 20 years.

        (4)

            (A) In the case of an employee who has service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter to which paragraph (2) of this subsection applies, the annuity of that employee is increased by $8 for each full month of that service which is performed in the Republic of Panama.

            (B)

             In the case of an employee retiring under this subchapter who—

                (i) was employed as a law enforcement officer or firefighter by the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government at any time during the period beginning March 31, 1979, and ending September 30, 1979; and

                (ii) does not meet the age and service requirements of [section 8336(c) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8336/c];

                the annuity of that employee is increased by $12 for each full month of that service which occurred before October 1, 1979.

            (C) An annuity increase under this paragraph does not apply with respect to service performed after completion of 20 years of service (or any combination of service) as a law enforcement officer or firefighter.

        (5)

         For the purpose of this subsection—

            (A)

             “Panama Canal service” means—

                (i) service as an employee of the Panama Canal Commission; or

                (ii) service at a permanent duty station in the Canal Zone or Republic of Panama as an employee of an Executive agency conducting operations in the Canal Zone or Republic of Panama; and

            (B) “Executive agency” includes the Smithsonian Institution.

        (6)

         The annuity of an employee retiring under [section 8336(j) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8336/j] is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except that with respect to service on or after December 21, 1972, the employee’s annuity is—

            (A) 2½ percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of the employee’s service on or after that date as does not exceed 20 years; plus

            (B) 2 percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of the employee’s service on or after that date as exceeds 20 years.

        (7) The annuity of an employee who is a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or a former judge of such court, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except, with respect to his service as a judge of such court, his service as a Member, his congressional employee service, and his military service (not exceeding 5 years) creditable under [section 8332 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8332], his annuity is computed by multiplying 2½ percent of his average pay by the years of that service.

    (e) The annuity of an employee retiring under [section 8336(e) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8336/e] is computed under subsection (a) of this section. That annuity may not be less than 50 percent of the average pay of the employee unless such employee has received, pursuant to [section 8342 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8342], payment of the lump-sum credit attributable to deductions under [section 8334(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/a] during any period of employment as an air traffic controller and such employee has not deposited in the Fund the amount received, with interest, pursuant to [section 8334(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/d/1].

    (f)

     The annuity computed under subsections (a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), and (s) may not exceed 80 percent of—

        (1) the average pay of the employee; or

        (2)

         the greatest of—

            (A) the final basic pay of the Member;

            (B) the average pay of the Member; or

            (C) the final basic pay of the appointive position of a former Member who elects to have his annuity computed or recomputed under [section 8344(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8344/d/1].

    (g)

     The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under [section 8337 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8337] is at least the smaller of—

        (1) 40 percent of his average pay; or

        (2) the sum obtained under subsections (a) through (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s) after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of separation and the date he becomes 60 years of age.

        However, if an employee or Member retiring under [section 8337 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8337] is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of this title) or pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that employee or Member shall be computed under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate, excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the smaller of the annuity otherwise payable under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate.

    (h) The annuity computed under subsections (a), (b), (d)(5), and (f) of this section for an employee retiring under section 8336(d), (h), (j), or (o) of this title is reduced by ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month the employee is under 55 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (c) and (f) of this section for a Member retiring under the second or third sentence of [section 8336(g) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8336/g] or the third sentence of [section 8338(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8338/b] is reduced by 1⁄12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the Member is under 60 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (a), (d)(6), and (f) of this section for a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces retiring under the second sentence of [section 8336(k) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8336/k] or the third sentence of [section 8338(c) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8338/c] is reduced by 1⁄12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the judge is under 60 years of age at the date of separation.

    (i)

     For the purposes of subsections (a)–(h), (n), (q), (r), or (s), the total service of any employee or Member shall not include any period of civilian service after July 31, 1920, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made under [section 8334(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/a] unless—

        (1) the employee or Member makes a deposit for such period as provided in section 8334(c) or (d)(1) of this title; or

        (2) no deposit is required for such service, as provided under [section 8334(g) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/g] or under any statute.

    (j)

        (1)

         The annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or a portion of the annuity, if jointly designated for this purpose by the employee or Member and the spouse of the employee or Member under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management) for an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse under [section 8341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b], unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive the spouse’s right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with the Office at the time that the employee or Member retires. Each such election shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Office shall, by regulation, prescribe, and shall be irrevocable. The Office shall provide, by regulation, that an employee or Member may waive the survivor annuity without the spouse’s consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office—

            (A) that the spouse’s whereabouts cannot be determined, or

            (B) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse’s consent would otherwise be inappropriate.

        (2) If an employee or Member has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h], the annuity of the employee or Member computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or any designated portion of the annuity, in the event that the former spouse is entitled to less than 55 percent of the employee or Member’s annuity) is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.

        (3)

         An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to have the annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) or a portion thereof reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h], unless all rights to survivor benefits for such former spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An election under this paragraph shall be made at the time of retirement or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved, subject to a deposit in the Fund by the retired employee or Member of an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been continuously in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under this paragraph by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under this paragraph, except that the total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph, paragraph (5), or subsection (k)(2) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under this paragraph, shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the entitlement of the former spouse. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under the first sentence of this paragraph. An election under this paragraph—

            (A)

             shall not be effective to the extent that it—

                (i)

                 conflicts with—

                    (I) any court order or decree referred to in subsection (h)(1) of [section 8341 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341], which was issued before the date of such election; or

                    (II) any agreement referred to in such subsection which was entered into before such date; or

                (ii) would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of [section 8341 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341] based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed 55 percent of the annuity to which the employee or Member is entitled under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s); and

            (B) shall not be effective, in the case of an employee or Member who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse’s written consent.

            The Office shall provide by regulation that subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be waived for either of the reasons set forth in the last sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection. In the case of a retired employee or Member whose annuity is being reduced in order to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse, an election to provide or increase a survivor annuity for any other former spouse (and to continue an appropriate reduction) may be made within the same period that, and subject to the same conditions under which, an election could be made under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection for a current spouse (subject to the provisions of this paragraph relating to consent of a current spouse, if the retired employee or Member is then married). The opportunity to make an election under the preceding sentence is in addition to any opportunity otherwise afforded under this paragraph.

        (4) In order to provide a survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of [section 8341 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341], the annuity of an employee or Member (or any designated portion or portions thereof) is reduced by 2½ percent of the first $3,600 thereof plus 10 percent of so much thereof as exceeds $3,600.

        (5)

            (A)

             Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month—

                (i) after the death of the spouse, or

                (ii) after the dissolution of the spouse’s marriage to the employee or Member, except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the spouse is entitled, as a former spouse, to a survivor annuity under [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h].

            (B) Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for a former spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month after the former spouse remarries before reaching age 55 or dies. This reduction shall be replaced by an appropriate reduction or reductions under paragraph (4) of this subsection if the retired employee or Member has (i) another former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity under [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h], (ii) a current spouse to whom the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and with respect to whom a survivor annuity was not jointly waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or (iii) a current spouse whom the employee or Member married after retirement and with respect to whom an election has been made under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph or subsection (k)(2) of this section.

            (C)

                (i) Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member’s spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h] (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee or Member’s annuity under paragraph (4) of this subsection for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee or Member’s spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.

                (ii) Such election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage, and the retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such retired employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement or, if later, the date the previous reduction in such retired employee or Member’s annuity was terminated under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which an annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the applicable date referred to in such sentence shall be 6 percent.

                (iii) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under clause (ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under clause (ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph or paragraph (3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this clause, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under clause (i), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under clause (i).

                (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, an election under this subparagraph may not be made for the purpose of providing an annuity in the case of a spouse by remarriage if such spouse was married to the employee or Member at the time of such employee or Member’s retirement, and all rights to survivor benefits for such spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were then waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection or a similar prior provision of law.

                (v)

                 An election to provide a survivor annuity to a person under this subparagraph—

                    (I) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under subsection (k)(1) of this section with respect to such person; or

                    (II) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such subsection (k)(1) with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subparagraph.

                (vi)

                 The deposit provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply if—

                    (I) the employee or Member makes an election under this subparagraph after having made an election under subsection (k)(1) of this section; and

                    (II) the election under such subsection (k)(1) becomes void under clause (v) of this subparagraph.

    (k)

        (1) At the time of retiring under section 8336 or 8338 of this title, an employee or Member who is found to be in good health by the Office may elect a reduced annuity instead of an annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) and name in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the employee or Member to receive an annuity under [section 8341(c) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/c] after the death of the retired employee or Member. The annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual named is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent. An annuity which is reduced under this paragraph or any similar prior provision of law shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the individual named under this paragraph, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced. In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this paragraph on behalf of the spouse may be made only if any right of such spouse to a survivor annuity based on the service of such employee or Member is waived in accordance with subsection (j)(1) of this section.

        (2)

            (A) An employee or Member, who is unmarried at the time of retiring under a provision of law which permits election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to such employee or Member’s spouse and who later marries, may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received in the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under [section 8341(h) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/h] (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the retired employee or Member’s current annuity as provided in subsection (j) of this section.

            (B)

                (i)

                 The election and reduction shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning after the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for a person—

                    (I) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to such person; or

                    (II) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such paragraph with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this paragraph.

                (ii) The retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired employee or Member’s annuity would have been reduced under subsection (j)(4) of this section since the commencing date of the annuity, if the employee or Member had been married at the time of retirement and had elected to provide a survivor annuity at that time, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.

            (C) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by this subsection or subsection (j)(3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this subparagraph, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under subparagraph (A), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under subparagraph (A).

            (D)

             Subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C) of this paragraph shall not apply if—

                (i) the employee or Member makes an election under this paragraph after having made an election under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and

                (ii) the election under such paragraph (1) becomes void under subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph.

    (l)

     The annuity computed under subsections (a)–(k), (n), (q), (r), and (s) for an employee who is a citizen of the United States is increased by $36 for each year of service in the employ of—

        (1) the Alaska Engineering Commission, or The Alaska Railroad, in Alaska between March 12, 1914, and July 1, 1923; or

        (2) the Isthmian Canal Commission, or the Panama Railroad Company, on the Isthmus of Panama between May 4, 1904, and April 1, 1914.

    (m) In computing any annuity under subsections (a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), and (s), the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes, without regard to the limitations imposed by subsection (f) of this section, the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For the purpose of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of this title under section 6301(2)(x)–(xiii) of this title, the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.

    (n) The annuity of an employee who is a Court of Federal Claims judge, bankruptcy judge, or United States magistrate judge is computed, with respect to service as a Court of Federal Claims judge, as a commissioner of the Court of Claims, as a referee in bankruptcy, as a bankruptcy judge, as a United States magistrate judge, and as a United States commissioner, and with respect to the military service of any such individual (not exceeding 5 years) creditable under [section 8332 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8332], by multiplying 2½ percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of that service.

    (o)

        (1)

            (A)

             An employee or Member—

                (i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and

                (ii) who notifies the Office at such time (in accordance with subsection (j)) that a survivor annuity under [section 8341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b] is not desired,

                may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such employee or Member, elect to have a reduction under subsection (j) made in the annuity of the employee or Member (or in such portion thereof as the employee or Member may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse of such employee or Member.

            (B)

             An employee or Member—

                (i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and

                (ii) who at such time designates (in accordance with subsection (j)) that a limited portion of the annuity of such employee or Member is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity under [section 8341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b],

                may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such employee or Member, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such employee or Member so used.

        (2)

            (A) An election under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be considered effective unless the amount specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the applicable 18-month period under paragraph (1).

            (B)

             The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is an amount equal to the sum of—

                (i) the additional cost to the System which is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b)(2) of this section and results from such election taking into account (I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity, and (II) the costs associated with providing for the later election; and

                (ii) interest on the additional cost determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph computed using the interest rate specified or determined under [section 8334(e) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8334/e] for the calendar year in which the amount to be deposited is determined.

        (3) An election by an employee or Member under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such employee or Member under subsection (j).

        (4) An annuity which is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the employee or Member whose annuity is so reduced.

        (5) Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the employee or Member involved elected such annuity at the time of retiring.

        (6) The Office shall, on an annual basis, inform each employee or Member who is eligible to make an election under this subsection of the right to make such election and the procedures and deadlines applicable to such election.

    (p)

        (1)

         In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service that was performed on a part-time basis—

            (A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and

            (B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee’s actual service, as determined by prorating an employee’s total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.

        (2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

        (3)

         In the administration of paragraph (1)—

            (A) subparagraph (A) of such paragraph shall apply with respect to service performed before, on, or after April 7, 1986; and

            (B)

             subparagraph (B) of such paragraph—

                (i) shall apply with respect to that portion of any annuity which is attributable to service performed on or after April 7, 1986; and

                (ii) shall not apply with respect to that portion of any annuity which is attributable to service performed before April 7, 1986.

    (q)

     The annuity of a member of the Capitol Police, or former member of the Capitol Police, retiring under this subchapter is computed in accordance with subsection (b), except that, in the case of a member who retires under section 8335(c) or 8336(m), and who meets the requirements of subsection (b)(2), the annuity of such member is—

        (1) 2½ percent of the member’s average pay multiplied by so much of such member’s total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus

        (2) 2 percent of the member’s average pay multiplied by so much of such member’s total service as exceeds 20 years.

    (r) The annuity of a member of the Supreme Court Police, or former member of the Supreme Court Police, retiring under this subchapter is computed in accordance with subsection (d).

    (s)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Two subsecs. (s) have been enacted. </sup></sup>  The annuity of a Member who has served in a position in the executive branch for which the rate of basic pay was reduced for the duration of the service of the Member in that position to remove the impediment to the appointment of the Member imposed by article I, section 6, clause 2 of the Constitution, shall, subject to a deposit in the Fund as provided under section 8334(m), be computed as though the rate of basic pay which would otherwise have been in effect during that period of service had been in effect.

    (s)

        (1) 1 For purposes of this subsection, the term “physicians comparability allowance” refers to an amount described in section 8331(3)(H).

        (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no part of a physicians comparability allowance shall be treated as basic pay for purposes of any computation under this section unless, before the date of the separation on which entitlement to annuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a Government physician (whether performed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection).

        (3) If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows:

<table>

          <tr>

            <td> 

        If the total amount of service performed, on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, as a Government physician is:  </td>

        (4)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 100 percent of all amounts received as a physicians comparability allowance shall, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this subsection) for purposes of computing—

            (A) an annuity under subsection (g); and

            (B) a survivor annuity under section 8341, if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service.

    (u)

  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. No subsec. (t) has been enacted. </sup></sup>  The annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter with service credited under section 8332(b)(17) shall be reduced by the amount necessary to ensure that the present value of the annuity payable to the employee is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity that would be payable to the employee under this subchapter if it were computed—

        (1) on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8332(b)(17); and

        (2) assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee.

        The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.

    The section is reorganized to eliminate repetition.

    In subsection (f)(2), the words “service of the type last performed” are substituted for “total service” in former section 2259(a), “service as a Congressional employee” in former section 2259(b), and “Member service” in former section 2259(c).

    In subsection (i), the words “by the employee or Member at the time of retirement” are added on authority of former section 2260(a)(1), which is carried into section 8341(b).

    In subsection (j), the words “an annuity computed as provided in [section 2259 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2259]” and “an annuity so computed” are omitted as unnecessary as former sections 2256 and 2258, which are carried into this title as sections 8336 and 8338, respectively, expressly require that the annuities authorized thereby must be computed under former section 2259, which is carried into this section.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
