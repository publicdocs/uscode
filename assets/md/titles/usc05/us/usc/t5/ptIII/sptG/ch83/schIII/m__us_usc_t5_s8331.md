If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or [section 8339(k)(2) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8339/k/2], United States Code, the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph, unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under this subparagraph, the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that such annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 1 full year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title based on the service of such annuitant is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. In applying paragraph (7) to an amount under this subparagraph, any portion of such amount attributable to clause (i) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (A) of such paragraph, and any portion of such amount attributable to clause (ii) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph.

If the annuitant so elects, the redetermined annuity will become payable as if such annuitant were retiring for the first time based on the separation from reemployment service, and the provisions of this section concerning computation of annuity (other than any provision of this paragraph) shall apply.

>                 “(ii) If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 full years (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under [section 8341(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8341/b], United States Code, based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect to have such person’s rights redetermined in accordance with regulations which the Office shall prescribe. Redetermined benefits elected under this clause shall be in lieu of any increased benefits which would otherwise be payable in accordance with the next to last sentence of subparagraph (B).

>             “(D) If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for less than 1 year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any amounts withheld under [section 8422(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8422/a], United States Code, from such annuitant’s pay for the period (or periods) involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to such annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8342(c) of such title).

>             “(E)

>              For purposes of determining the period of an annuitant’s reemployment service under this paragraph, a period of reemployment service shall not be taken into account unless—

>                 “(i) with respect to service performed before the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service which, if performed for at least 1 full year, would have allowed such annuitant to elect under [section 8344(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8344/a], United States Code, to have deductions withheld from pay; or

>                 “(ii) with respect to service performed on or after the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service with respect to which deductions from pay would be required to be withheld under the second sentence of [section 8468(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8468/a], United States Code.
