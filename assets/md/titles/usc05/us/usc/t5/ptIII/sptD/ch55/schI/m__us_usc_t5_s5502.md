    In subsection (a), the words “in the civil service or uniformed services” are substituted for “civil, military, or naval”.

    In subsection (b), the words “Except as otherwise provided by statute” are added in recognition of the Act of Aug. 25, 1958, [Pub. L. 85–745][/us/pl/85/745], [72 Stat. 838][/us/stat/72/838], which authorizes an office staff for former Presidents. The reference to “public money and appropriations” is added for clarity.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
