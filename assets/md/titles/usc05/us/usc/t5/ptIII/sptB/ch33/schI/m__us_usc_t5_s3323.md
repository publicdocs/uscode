## § 3323. Automatic separations; reappointment; re­employment of annuitants

    (a) An individual who reaches the retirement age prescribed for automatic separation applicable to him may not be continued in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. An individual separated on account of age under a statute or regulation providing for retirement on account of age is not eligible for appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. The President, when in his judgment the public interest so requires, may except an individual from this subsection by Executive order. This subsection does not apply to an individual named by a statute providing for the continuance of the individual in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia.

    (b)

        (1) Notwithstanding other statutes, an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401, receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed, other than an annuitant reappointed under paragraph (2) of this subsection, serves at the will of the appointing authority.

        (2) Subject to such regulations as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, any annuitant to whom the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection applies and who has served as an administrative law judge pursuant to an appointment under [section 3105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3105] may be reappointed an administrative law judge under such section for a specified period or for such period as may be necessary for such administrative law judge to conduct and complete the hearing and disposition of one or more specified cases. The provisions of this title that apply to or with respect to administrative law judges appointed under [section 3105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3105] shall apply to or with respect to administrative law judges reappointed under such section pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.

    (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a member of the Foreign Service retired under section 812 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in a position in the civil service for which he is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed serves at the will of the appointing authority.

    (d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Chief of Engineers of the Army, under [section 569a of title 33][/us/usc/t33/s569a], may employ a retired employee whose expert assistance is needed in connection with river and harbor or flood control works. There shall be deducted from the pay of an employee so reemployed an amount equal to the annuity or retired pay allocable to the period of actual employment.

The word “authority” is substituted for “officer” in recognition of the several appointing authorities named in section 2105(a)(1).

    In subsection (d), the words “Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section” are substituted for “The provisions of [section 715a of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s715a] shall not be so construed as to prevent” to reflect the codification of former section 715a in subsection (a) of this section, and to conform to the style of this section. The words “under [section 569a of title 33][/us/usc/t33/s569a]” are substituted for “under agreement as authorized by sections 569a, 584a and 607a of title 33” on authority of the provision contained in [section 569a of title 33][/us/usc/t33/s569a]. The word “employee” is coextensive with and substituted for “civilian employee” in view of the definition of “employee” in section 2105. The last sentence is restated for clarity.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
