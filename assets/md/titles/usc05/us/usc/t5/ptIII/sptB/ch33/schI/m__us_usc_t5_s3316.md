    The word “authority” is substituted for “officer” in recognition of the several appointing authorities named in section 2105(a)(1).

    The words “in the competitive service, an Executive agency, or the government of the District of Columbia” are substituted for “in the civil service, Federal, or District of Columbia, or in any establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, or department, temporary or permanent” on authority of former section 869.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
