    The word “personal” is added before the word “effects” for clarity and to preserve consistency throughout this subchapter. The words “employees of the United States . . . and members of the uniformed services” are substituted for “military personnel and civilian employees of departments and agencies of the Federal Government”. The words “a volunteer as defined by [section 8142(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8142/a]” are based on sections 2504(a), 2505, and 2507 (a) of title 22. The words “pursuant to law” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __Amendments__ 

    1998—[Pub. L. 105–264][/us/pl/105/264] substituted “Government” for “United States” in introductory provisions.

    (b) The term “civilian employees” means civilian officers and employees of a department, including Foreign Service personnel, and former and deceased civilian officers and employees.

    (c) The terms “military personnel” and “civilian employees” shall also include those individuals enumerated under the term “person” as defined in section 1 of the Missing Persons Act, as amended \[now [section 5561 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5561]\].

    (d) The term “department” means an executive department, independent establishment, or other agency of the Federal Government, including wholly-owned or controlled Government corporations.

    (e) The term “general-average contribution” means the contribution by all parties to a sea venture (1) to make good the loss sustained by any one of their number on account of voluntary sacrifices made of part of the ship or cargo to save the residue or the lives of those on board from impending peril, or (2) for extraordinary expenses necessarily incurred for the common benefit and safety of all.

    (f) The term “household goods” means such baggage, household goods, and effects, including privately-owned automobiles and professional books, papers, and equipment, of military personnel and civilian employees as are authorized to be transported at Government expense by law or regulations pursuant to law.

    Sec. 2. Allowance of general-average contributions. Whenever military personnel or civilian employees of a department are liable for general-average contributions arising out of shipments of household goods (as defined in section 1 (f) hereof), authorized or approved under law or regulations pursuant to law, disbursements shall be made, under rules and regulations prescribed by the head of the department concerned, from appropriations chargeable for the transportation of baggage and household goods and effects (a) for the payment of the general-average contributions for which such military personnel or civilian employees are liable, or (b) for the reimbursement of such military personnel or civilian employees in the amounts of their general-average liability paid by them and for which receipts are furnished, subject to the limitations set forth in section 3 hereof.

    Sec. 4. Effective date. This order shall be effective in any case in which the loss involved occurs, or has occurred, on or after June 4, 1954.
