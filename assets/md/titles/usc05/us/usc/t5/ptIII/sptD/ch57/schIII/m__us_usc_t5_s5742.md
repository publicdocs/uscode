## § 5742. Transportation of remains, dependents, and effects; death occurring away from official station or abroad

    (a)

     For the purpose of this section, “agency” means—

        (1) an Executive agency;

        (2) a military department;

        (3) an agency in the legislative branch; and

        (4) an agency in the judicial branch.

        (1) the expense of preparing and transporting the remains to the home or official station of the employee, or such other place appropriate for interment as is determined by the head of the agency concerned, if death occurred while the employee was in a travel status away from his official station in the United States or while performing official duties outside the continental United States or in transit thereto or therefrom;

        (2)

         the expense of transporting his dependents, including expenses of packing, crating, draying, and transporting household effects and other personal property to his former home or such other place as is determined by the head of the agency concerned, if—

            (A) the employee died while performing official duties outside the continental United States or in transit thereto or therefrom; or

            (B)

             in the case of an employee who was a party to a mandatory mobility agreement that was in effect when the employee died—

                (i) the employee died in the circumstances described in subparagraph (A); or

                (ii)

                    (I)

                     the employee died as a result of disease or injury incurred while performing official duties—

                        (aa) in an overseas location that, at the time such employee was performing such official duties, was within the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Central Command; and

                    (II) the employee’s dependents were residing either outside the continental United States or within the continental United States when the employee died; and

        (3) the travel expenses of not more than 2 persons to escort the remains of a deceased employee, if death occurred while the employee was in travel status away from his official station in the United States or while performing official duties outside the United States or in transit thereto or therefrom, from the place of death to the home or official station of such person, or such other place appropriate for interment as is determined by the head of the agency concerned.

    (c)

     When a dependent of an employee dies while residing with the employee performing official duties outside the continental United States or in Alaska or in transit thereto or therefrom, the head of the agency concerned may pay the necessary expenses of transporting the remains to the home of the dependent, or such other place appropriate for interment as is determined by the head of the agency concerned.

    Subsection (a) is based on the words “department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation, hereinafter called department” in former section 103a. The terms “Executive agency” and “military department” include a department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation in the executive branch because of the definitions in sections 105 and 102.

    The words “a military department” are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 ([63 Stat. 578][/us/stat/63/578]), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force, as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 ([63 Stat. 591][/us/stat/63/591]), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301.

    Subsection (b) is restated for clarity and conciseness and to eliminate redundancy. In paragraphs (1) and (2), the words “outside the United States” are coextensive with and substituted for “in a Territory or possession of the United States or in a foreign country”.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
