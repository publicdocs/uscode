    In subsection (a), the term “Executive agency” is substituted for “any agency or project of the Federal Government” on authority of former section 869. The last 28 words of the 1st sentence of former section 864 relating to recertification and reappointment are omitted since under sections 3317 and 3318(a) certification and appointment follow from placing on registers.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
