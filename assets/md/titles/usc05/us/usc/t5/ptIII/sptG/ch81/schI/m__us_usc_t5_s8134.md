    (b)

     The body of an employee whose home is in the United States, in the discretion of the Secretary, may be embalmed and transported in a hermetically sealed casket to his home or last place of residence at the expense of the Employees’ Compensation Fund if—

        (1)

         the employee dies from—

            (A) the injury while away from his home or official station or outside the United States; or

    In subsection (a), the words “an injury sustained in the performance of duty” are substituted for “the injury” to clearly identify the type of injury to which the section refers.

    Administration of this subchapter was transferred to the Secretary of Labor by section 1 of 1950 Reorg. Plan. No. 19, [64 Stat. 1271][/us/stat/64/1271] (see section 8145).

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
