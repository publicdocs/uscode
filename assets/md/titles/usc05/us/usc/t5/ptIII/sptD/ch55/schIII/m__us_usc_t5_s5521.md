    In paragraph (1), the word “agency” is substituted for “department”. The term “Executive agency” is substituted for the reference to “each executive department of the Government of the United States of America; each agency or independent establishment in the executive branch of such Government; each corporation wholly owned or controlled by such Government” in former section 3071(1)(A)–(C).

    Paragraph (2) is added for clarity and in view of the fact that the definition of “employee” in section 2105 does not include individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia.

    In paragraph (3), the term “department head” is omitted as unnecessary.

    In paragraph (4), the words “of the United States of America” are omitted as unnecessary.
