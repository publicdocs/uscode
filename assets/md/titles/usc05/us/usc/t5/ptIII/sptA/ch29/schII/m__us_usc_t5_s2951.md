    The authority of the President to prescribe rules is added on authority of former section 633(1), which is carried into section 3302.

    In paragraph (1), the word “authority” is substituted for “power”. The words “or employment” are omitted as included within “appointment”.

    In paragraph (1)(B), the words “separation during probation” are substituted for “of the rejection of any such person after probation”. The words “rejection . . . after probation” refer to a rejection, i.e., separation, after a portion of the probationary period has been served but before the end of the probationary period. This is so because an individual can be rejected only during the probationary period. After he has completed the probationary period, he can be removed only under procedures governing removals from the competitive service, and removals of this nature are covered by paragraph (E).

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

 __Amendments__ 

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–454, § 906(a)(16)][/us/pl/95/454/s906/a/16], substituted “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission” in section catchline.

    Pars. (1), (2). [Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454] substituted “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission” and “Office” for “Commission”.

 __Effective Date of 1978 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454] effective 90 days after Oct. 13, 1978, see [section 907 of Pub. L. 95–454][/us/pl/95/454/s907], set out as a note under [section 1101 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s1101].
