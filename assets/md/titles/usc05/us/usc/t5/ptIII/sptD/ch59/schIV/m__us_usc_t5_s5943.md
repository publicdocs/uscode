    (a) The President, under such regulations as he may prescribe, may meet losses sustained by employees and members of the uniformed services while serving in a foreign country due to the appreciation of foreign currency in its relation to the American dollar. Allowances and expenditures under this section are not subject to income taxes.

    (c) Payment under subsection (a) of this section may not be made to an employee or member of a uniformed service for a period during which his check or draft was converted into foreign currency under the arrangement referred to by subsection (b) of this section.
