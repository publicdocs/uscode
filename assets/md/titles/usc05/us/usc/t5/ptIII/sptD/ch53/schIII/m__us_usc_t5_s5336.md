## § 5336. Additional step-increases

    (a) Within the limit of available appropriations and under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, the head of each agency may grant additional step-increases in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily found in the type of position concerned. However, an employee is eligible under this section for only one additional step-increase within any 52-week period.

    (b) A step-increase under this section is in addition to those under [section 5335 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5335] and is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of [section 5335(a) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5335/a].

    (c) This section does not apply to the pay of an individual appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
