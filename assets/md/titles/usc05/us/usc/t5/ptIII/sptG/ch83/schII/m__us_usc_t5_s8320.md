    The reference to conviction of an offense which constitutes a violation of former section 2283 (which is carried into this title as sections 8314 and 8315) is omitted as being covered by the words “violated section 8314 or 8315 of this title” which are added on authority of the words “conviction or violation” in former section 2285(c).

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
