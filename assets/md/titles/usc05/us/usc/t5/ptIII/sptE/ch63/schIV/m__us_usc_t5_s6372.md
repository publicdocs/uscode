        (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may authorize an individual employed by the Bureau to participate in a leave bank program administered by the Department of Justice under this subchapter if in the Director’s judgment such participation will not adversely affect the protection of intelligence sources and methods.

    (c)

        (1) The head of an excepted agency may, by regulation, establish a voluntary leave bank program under which annual leave accrued or accumulated by an employee of such agency may be contributed to a leave bank, and any other employee of such agency may receive additional leave from such leave bank because of a medical emergency.

        (2) To the extent practicable, and consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and methods (if applicable), each program under this section shall be established in a manner consistent with the provisions of this subchapter applicable to the program.
