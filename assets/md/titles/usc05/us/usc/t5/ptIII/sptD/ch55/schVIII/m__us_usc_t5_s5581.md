    Paragraph (1) is supplied for convenience and is based on the first 35 words of former section 61f, which is carried into section 5582, and former section 61k.

    The exception for production credit corporations in [section 7 of the Act of Aug. 3, 1950][/us/act/1950-08-03/s7], is omitted as they were merged in the Federal intermediate credit banks by the Farm Credit Act of 1956, [70 Stat. 659][/us/stat/70/659].

    The exception in paragraph (1)(iv) for employees of the Senate is added on authority of the [Act of Jan. 6, 1951, ch. 1213][/us/act/1951-01-06/ch1213], [64 Stat. 1124][/us/stat/64/1124]; [2 U.S.C. 36a][/us/usc/t2/s36a].

    In paragraph (2), the definition of “money due” is substituted for “unpaid compensation”. Paragraph (2)(I) is added on authority of former section 1182(a)(2), which is carried into section 5344.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
