    The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.

    In subsection (a)(1)(i), the exception of “a Government controlled corporation” is added to preserve the application of this chapter to “corporations wholly owned by the United States”. This is necessary as the defined term “Executive agency” includes the defined term “Government corporation” and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of the chapter to wholly owned corporations.

    In subsection (a)(1)(vii), the words “Panama Canal Company” are substituted for “Panama Railroad Company” on authority of the [Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049][/us/act/1950-09-26/ch1049], § 2(a)(2), [64 Stat. 1038][/us/stat/64/1038].

    The exception for the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 1082(13) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, [Pub. L. 88–67][/us/pl/88/67], [77 Stat. 81][/us/stat/77/81].

    The exceptions for Production Credit Corporations and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in former section 1082(18) and (19) are omitted as they are no longer “corporations wholly owned by the United States”. Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, [70 Stat. 659][/us/stat/70/659], the Production Credit Corporations were merged in the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have ceased to be corporations wholly owned by the United States.

    Subsection (a)(2) is added for clarity. The reference to “an individual employed in or under an agency” includes both officers and employees of an agency.

    In subsection (a)(5), the words “in the General Schedule” are substituted for the reference in former section 1091(3) to “as specified in subchapter V of this chapter”.

    In subsection (b), the reference to former section 1085 is omitted as unnecessary. Former section 1085 which exempted certain agencies from former sections 1151–1153 is carried into section 305.
