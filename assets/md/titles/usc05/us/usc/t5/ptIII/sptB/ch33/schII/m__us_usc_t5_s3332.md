    The section is restated for clarity and conciseness. The term “officer” is coextensive with and substituted for “Each individual appointed hereafter as a civil officer of the United States by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the President alone, or by a court of law, or by the head of a department” in view of the definition of “officer” in section 2104.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
