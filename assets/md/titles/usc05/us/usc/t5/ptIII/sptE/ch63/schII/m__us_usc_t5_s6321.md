    The words “Executive agency” are coextensive with and substituted for “executive branch of the Government” in view of the definition of “Executive agency” in section 105. Applicability to the General Accounting Office is based on former section 933a.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
