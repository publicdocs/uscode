## § 8146. Administration for the Panama Canal Commission and The Alaska Railroad

    (a)

     The President, from time to time, may transfer the administration of this subchapter—

        (1) so far as employees of the Panama Canal Commission are concerned to the Commission; and

        (2) so far as employees of The Alaska Railroad are concerned to the general manager of The Alaska Railroad.

    (b) When administration is transferred under subsection (a) of this section, the expenses incident to physical examinations which are payable under [section 8123 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8123] shall be paid from appropriations for the Panama Canal Commission or for The Alaska Railroad, as the case may be, instead of from the Employees’ Compensation Fund. The President may authorize the Panama Canal Commission and the general manager of The Alaska Railroad to pay the compensation provided by this subchapter, including medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies under [section 8103 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8103] and the transportation and burial expenses under sections 8103 and 8134 of this title, from appropriations for the Panama Canal Commission and for The Alaska Railroad, and these appropriations shall be reimbursed for the payments by transfer of funds from the Employees’ Compensation Fund.

    (c) The President may authorize the Panama Canal Commission to waive, at its discretion, the making of the claim required by [section 8121 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8121] in the case of compensation to an employee of the Panama Canal Commission for temporary disability, either total or partial.

    (d) When administration is transferred under subsection (a) of this section to the general manager of The Alaska Railroad, the Secretary of Labor is not divested of jurisdiction and a claimant is entitled to appeal from the decision of the general manager of The Alaska Railroad to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary on receipt of an appeal shall, or on his own motion may, review the decision of the general manager of The Alaska Railroad, and in accordance with the facts found on review may proceed under [section 8128 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8128]. The Secretary shall provide the form and manner of taking an appeal.

    (e) The same right of appeal exists with respect to claims filed by employees of the Panama Canal Commission or their dependents in case of death, as is provided with respect to the claims of other employees to whom this subchapter applies, under [section 8149 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8149]. The Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board referred to by [section 8149 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s8149] has jurisdiction, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, over appeals relating to claims of the employees or their dependents.
