    In the last sentence, the word “removed” is substituted for “summarily removed” because of the provisions of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act [37 Stat. 555][/us/stat/37/555], as amended, and the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944, [58 Stat. 387][/us/stat/58/387], as amended, which are carried into this title.

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
