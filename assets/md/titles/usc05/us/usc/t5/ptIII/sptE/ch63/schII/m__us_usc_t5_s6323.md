        (2) In the case of an employee or individual employed on a part-time career employment basis (as defined in [section 3401(2) of this title][/us/usc/t5/s3401/2]), the rate at which leave accrues under this subsection shall be a percentage of the rate prescribed under paragraph (1) which is determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of that employee or individual during that fiscal year.

        (3) The minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof.

    (b)

     Except as provided by [section 5519 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5519], an employee as defined by [section 2105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2105] or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, permanent or temporary indefinite, who—

Leave granted by this subsection shall not exceed 22 workdays in a calendar year. Upon the request of an employee, the period for which an employee is absent to perform service described in paragraph (2) may be charged to the employee’s accrued annual leave or to compensatory time available to the employee instead of being charged as leave to which the employee is entitled under this subsection. The period of absence may not be charged to sick leave.

    (c) An employee as defined by [section 2105 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s2105] or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, who is a member of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, is entitled to leave without loss in pay or time for each day of a parade or encampment ordered or authorized under title 39, District of Columbia Code.

        (2) An employee who requests annual leave or compensatory time to which the employee is otherwise entitled, for a period during which the employee would have been entitled upon request to leave under this subsection, may be granted such annual leave or compensatory time without regard to this section or section 5519.
