    In paragraph (2), the words “a military department” are substituted for “the War Department or Navy Department” (appearing in [section 2 of the Act of June 27, 1944][/us/act/1944-06-27/s2]) because of the definition of “military department” in section 102. The Department of War was designated the Department of the Army by the [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 205][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343/s205], [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]. “Department of the Air Force” is included on authority of the [Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, § 207][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343/s207] (a), (f), [61 Stat. 502][/us/stat/61/502].
