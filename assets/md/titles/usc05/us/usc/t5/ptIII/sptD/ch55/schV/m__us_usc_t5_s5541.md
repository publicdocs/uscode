    The section is revised as a definition section. The provisions of former section 901(d) are omitted as unnecessary because the sections referred to state their application and there is no need to restate the application here.

    In paragraph (1), the terms “Executive agency” and “military department” are substituted for the references in former section 901(a) and (e) to the executive branch, including Government-owned or controlled corporations, and the General Accounting Office in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102.

    In paragraph (2)(iii), the words “chapter 15 of title 31, District of Columbia Code” are substituted for the reference in former section 902(a)(4) to “the Teachers Salary Act of June 4, 1924, as amended” on authority of the provisions contained therein. Enumeration of the individuals to which the provisions apply are added.

    In paragraph (2)(iv), the provisions of former section 902(a)(5) and (b)(6) are combined.

    In paragraph (2)(v), the words “student-employee as defined by [section 5351 of this title][/us/usc/t5/s5351]” are coextensive with and substituted for the enumeration of the employees in former section 902(a)(6).

    In paragraph (2)(iv), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (xi), and (xii), the reference to former section 947 is omitted as that section was repealed by the [Act of Sept. 12, 1950, ch. 946, § 301(85)][/us/act/1950-09-12/ch946/s301/85], [64 Stat. 843][/us/stat/64/843].

    In paragraph (2)(xii), the reference to former section 946 is omitted as unnecessary since that section is not carried into this subchapter. The words “Panama Canal Company” are substituted for “Panama Railroad Company” on authority of the [Act of Sept. 2, 1950, ch. 1049, § 2(a)(2)][/us/act/1950-09-02/ch1049/s2/a/2], [64 Stat. 1038][/us/stat/64/1038].

    In paragraph (2)(xiii), the words “as defined by [section 901 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s901]” are added on authority of former section 2351, which section is scheduled for transfer to [section 901 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s901].

    The exception for officers and employees of the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 902(b)(3) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, [Pub. L. 88–67][/us/pl/88/67], [77 Stat. 81][/us/stat/77/81].

    Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
