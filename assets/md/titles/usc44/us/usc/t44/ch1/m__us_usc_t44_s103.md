 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on 44 U.S. Code, 1964 ed., § 4 ([Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23][/us/act/1895-01-12/ch23], § 2, [28 Stat. 601][/us/stat/28/601]; [Mar. 1, 1907, ch. 2284][/us/act/1907-03-01/ch2284], § 1, [34 Stat. 1012][/us/stat/34/1012]; [Mar. 1, 1919, ch. 86][/us/act/1919-03-01/ch86], § 11, [40 Stat. 1270][/us/stat/40/1270]).
