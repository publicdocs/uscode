## § 1321. Hydrographic Surveys; foreign surveys

    Appropriations made for the preparation or publication of foreign hydrographic surveys may be applicable only upon approval by the Secretary of the Navy, after a report from three competent naval officers that the original data for proposed charts justify their publication. The Secretary of the Navy shall order a board of three naval officers to examine and report upon the data before he approves an application of moneys to the preparation or publication of charts or hydrographic surveys.
