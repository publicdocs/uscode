## § 1702. Superintendent of Documents; sale of documents

    The Director of the Government Publishing Office shall appoint a competent person to act as Superintendent of Documents who shall be under the control of the Director of the Government Publishing Office.

    When an officer of the Government having in his charge documents published for sale desires to be relieved of them, he may turn them over to the Superintendent of Documents, who shall receive and sell them under this section. Moneys received from the sale of documents shall be returned to the Director of the Government Publishing Office on the first day of each month and be covered into the Treasury monthly.

    The Superintendent of Documents shall also report monthly to the Director of the Government Publishing Office the number of documents received by him and the disposition made of them. He shall have general supervision of the distribution of all public documents, and to his custody shall be committed all documents subject to distribution, excepting those printed for the special official use of the executive departments, which shall be delivered to the departments, and those printed for the use of the two Houses of Congress, which shall be delivered to the Senate Service Department and House of Representatives Publications Distribution Service and distributed or delivered ready for distribution to Members upon their order by the superintendents of the Senate Service Department and House Publications Distribution Service, respectively.

([Pub. L. 90–620][/us/pl/90/620], Oct. 22, 1968, [82 Stat. 1279][/us/stat/82/1279]; [Pub. L. 113–235, div. H, title I, § 1301(c)(1)][/us/pl/113/235/s1301/c/1], Dec. 16, 2014, [128 Stat. 2537][/us/stat/128/2537].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on 44 U.S. Code, 1964 ed., §§ 71, 73 (part) ([Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, § 61][/us/act/1895-01-12/ch23/s61], [28 Stat. 610][/us/stat/28/610]; [June 25, 1910, ch. 384, § 1][/us/act/1910-06-25/ch384/s1], [36 Stat. 770][/us/stat/36/770]; [Aug. 7, 1946, ch. 770, § 1(62)][/us/act/1946-08-07/ch770/s1/62], [60 Stat. 871][/us/stat/60/871]).

    This section incorporates only part of former section 73. The balance will be found in section 308 of the revision.

    “House of Representatives Publications Distribution Service” is substituted for “House Folding Room” because of the change of name under authority of [Public Law 88–652][/us/pl/88/652].

 __Amendments__ 

    2014—[Pub. L. 113–235][/us/pl/113/235] substituted “Director of the Government Publishing Office” for “Public Printer” wherever appearing.
