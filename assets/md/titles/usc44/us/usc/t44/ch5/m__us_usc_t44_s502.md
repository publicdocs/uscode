>     In this section, the term ‘small and disadvantaged businesses’ means the small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions described in [section 2323(a) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2323/a], United States Code.

>     “(c) __Enforcement.—__ 

>     Any person who, for the purpose of securing a contract under subsection (a), misrepresents the status of any concern or person as a small business concern referred to in subsection (b), is subject to the penalties set forth in [section 2323(f) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2323/f], United States Code.

>     “(d) __Department of Defense Goals.—__ 

>     For the purpose of determining whether the Department of Defense has attained the goals set forth in [section 2323 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2323], United States Code, the Secretary of Defense may count any procurements by the Public Printer in the program established under subsection (a).
