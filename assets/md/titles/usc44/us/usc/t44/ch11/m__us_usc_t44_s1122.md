## § 1122. Supplies for Government establishments

    The Public Printer may procure and supply, on the requisition of the head of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government, complete manifold blanks, books, and forms required in duplicating processes, and complete patented devices with which to file money-order statements, or other uniform official papers, and charge them to the allotment for printing and binding of the department or Government establishment requiring them.

([Pub. L. 90–620][/us/pl/90/620], Oct. 22, 1968, [82 Stat. 1264][/us/stat/82/1264].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on 44 U.S. Code, 1964 ed., § 227 ([June 28, 1902, ch. 1301, § 1][/us/act/1902-06-28/ch1301/s1], [32 Stat. 481][/us/stat/32/481]).

    The term “executive department, independent office, or establishment of the government” is substituted for “executive department or other government establishment” for uniformity.
