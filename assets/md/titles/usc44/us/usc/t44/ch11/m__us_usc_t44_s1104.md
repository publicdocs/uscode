## § 1104. Restrictions on use of illustrations

    Appropriations made for printing and binding may not be used for an illustration, engraving, or photograph in a document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the order to print expressly authorizes it, nor in a document or report of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government until the head of the executive department or Government establishment certifies in a letter transmitting the report that the illustration, engraving, or photograph is necessary and relates entirely to the transaction of public business.

([Pub. L. 90–620][/us/pl/90/620], Oct. 22, 1968, [82 Stat. 1261][/us/stat/82/1261].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on 44 U.S. Code, 1964 ed., § 118 ([Mar. 3, 1905, ch. 1483, § 1][/us/act/1905-03-03/ch1483/s1], [33 Stat. 1213][/us/stat/33/1213]).

    The term “executive department, independent office, or establishment of the Government” is substituted for “executive department or other Government establishment” for uniformity.
