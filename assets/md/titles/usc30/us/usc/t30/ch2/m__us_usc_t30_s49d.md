## § 49d. Miners’ regulations for recording notices in Alaska; certain records legalized

    Miners in any organized mining district may make rules and regulations governing the recording of notices of location of mining claims, water rights, flumes and ditches, mill sites and affidavits of labor, not in conflict with this Act or the general laws of the United States; and nothing in this Act shall be construed so as to prevent the miners in any regularly organized mining district not within any recording district established by the court from electing their own mining recorder to act as such until a recorder therefor is appointed by the court: Provided further, All records regularly made by the United States commissioner prior to June 6, 1900, at Dyea, Skagway, and the recorder at Douglas City, not in conflict with any records regularly made with the United States commissioner at Juneau, are legalized. And all records made in good faith prior to June 6, 1900, in any regularly organized mining district are made public records.
