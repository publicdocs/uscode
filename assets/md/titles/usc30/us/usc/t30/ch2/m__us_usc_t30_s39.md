 __Amendments__ 

    1925—Act Mar. 3, 1925, affected words in first sentence of text, now reading “The United States supervisor of surveys,” and words in third sentence of text, now reading “money paid the register of the Land Office.” Such words formerly read “the surveyor-general of the United States,” and “and money paid the register and the receiver of the land-office.” Such act is treated more fully in note under [section 29 of this title][/us/usc/t30/s29].

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    Director of the Bureau of Land Management substituted for United States Supervisor of Surveys in sentence beginning “The Director of the Bureau of Land Management may appoint”. In the establishment of the Bureau of Land Management by Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946, § 403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, [60 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/60/1100], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, the office of Supervisor of Surveys was abolished and the functions and powers were transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, to be performed by such officers or agencies of the Department as might be designated by the Secretary. Under that authority, the functions and powers formerly exercised by the Supervisor of Surveys were delegated to the Chief Cadastral Engineer, subject to the supervision of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. In the general reorganization and realignment of functions of the Bureau, the office of the Chief Cadastral Engineer was abolished, and the functions of that office have been delegated to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. See 43 C.F.R. § 9180.0–3(a)(1).
