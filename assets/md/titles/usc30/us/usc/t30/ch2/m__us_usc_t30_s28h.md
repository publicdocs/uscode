## § 28h. Co-ownership

    The co-ownership provisions of the Mining Law of 1872 ([30 U.S.C. 28][/us/usc/t30/s28])  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  shall remain in effect, except that in applying such provisions, the annual claim maintenance fee required under this Act shall, where applicable, replace applicable assessment requirements and expenditures.

([Pub. L. 103–66, title X, § 10103][/us/pl/103/66/s10103], Aug. 10, 1993, [107 Stat. 406][/us/stat/107/406].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Mining Law of 1872 ([30 U.S.C. 28][/us/usc/t30/s28]), referred to in text, probably means [act May 10, 1872, ch. 152][/us/act/1872-05-10/ch152], [17 Stat. 91][/us/stat/17/91], as amended. That act was incorporated into the Revised Statutes as R.S. §§ 2319 to 2328, 2331, 2333 to 2337, and 2344, which are classified to sections 22 to 24, 26 to 28, 29, 30, 33 to 35, 37, 39 to 42, and 47 of this title. For complete classification of R.S. §§ 2319 to 2328, 2331, 2333 to 2337, and 2344 to the Code, see Tables.

    This Act, referred to in text, is [Pub. L. 103–66][/us/pl/103/66], Aug. 10, 1993, [107 Stat. 312][/us/stat/107/312], known as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The annual claim maintenance fee required under this Act probably refers to the fee required under [section 28f of this title][/us/usc/t30/s28f]. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

 __Similar Provisions__ 

    Similar provisions were contained in [Pub. L. 102–381, title I][/us/pl/102/381], Oct. 5, 1992, [106 Stat. 1378][/us/stat/106/1378], 1379.
