## § 1005. Lease term and work commitment requirements

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Primary term__ 

            A geothermal lease shall be for a primary term of 10 years.

        (2) __Initial extension__ 

        The Secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal lease for 5 years if, for each year after the 10th year of the lease—

            (A) the Secretary determined under subsection (b) that the lessee satisfied the work commitment requirements that applied to the lease for that year; or

            (B) the lessee paid in annual payments accordance with subsection (c).

        (3) __Additional extension__ 

            The Secretary shall extend the primary term of a geothermal lease (after an initial extension under paragraph (2)) for an additional 5 years if, for each year of the initial extension under paragraph (2), the Secretary determined under subsection (b) that the lessee satisfied the minimum work requirements that applied to the lease for that year.

    (b) __Requirement to satisfy annual minimum work requirement__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The lessee for a geothermal lease shall, for each year after the 10th year of the lease, satisfy minimum work requirements prescribed by the Secretary that apply to the lease for that year.

        (2) __Prescription of minimum work requirements__ 

        The Secretary shall issue regulations prescribing minimum work requirements for geothermal leases, that—

            (A) establish a geothermal potential; and

            (B) if a geothermal potential has been established, confirm the existence of producible geothermal resources.

    (c) __Payments in lieu of minimum work requirements__ 

        In lieu of the minimum work requirements set forth in subsection (b)(2), the Secretary shall by regulation establish minimum annual payments which may be made by the lessee for a limited number of years that the Secretary determines will not impair achieving diligent development of the geothermal resource, but in no event shall the number of years exceed the duration of the extension period provided in subsection (a).

    (d) __Transition rules for leases issued prior to__  __August 8, 2005__ 

    The Secretary shall by regulation establish transition rules for leases issued before August 8, 2005, including terms under which a lease that is near the end of its term on August 8, 2005, may be extended for up to 2 years—

        (1) to allow achievement of production under the lease; or

        (2) to allow the lease to be included in a producing unit.

    (e) __Geothermal lease overlying mining claim__ 

        (1) __Exemption__ 

            The lessee for a geothermal lease of an area overlying an area subject to a mining claim for which a plan of operations has been approved by the relevant Federal land management agency is exempt from annual work requirements established under this chapter, if development of the geothermal resource subject to the lease would interfere with the mining operations under such claim.

        (2) __Termination of exemption__ 

            An exemption under this paragraph expires upon the termination of the mining operations.

    (f) __Termination of application of requirements__ 

        Minimum work requirements prescribed under this section shall not apply to a geothermal lease after the date on which the geothermal resource is utilized under the lease in commercial quantities.

    (g) __Cooperative or unit plan for drilling operations; extension of term; renewal__ 

        Any lease for land on which, or for which under an approved cooperative or unit plan of development or operation, actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time shall be extended for five years and so long thereafter, but not more than thirty-five years, as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities. If, at the end of such extended term, steam is being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the lessee shall have a preferential right to a renewal of such lease for a second term in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.

    (h) __“Produced or utilized in commercial quantities” defined__ 

        Except as otherwise provided for in this section, for purposes of this section the term “produced or utilized in commercial quantities” means the completion of a well producing geothermal steam in commercial quantities. Such term shall also include the completion of a well capable of producing geothermal steam in commercial quantities so long as the Secretary determines that diligent efforts are being made toward the utilization of the geothermal steam.

    (i) __Principles for location of minerals under mining laws when minerals are not associated with geothermal resources__ 

        Minerals locatable under the mining laws of the United States in lands subject to a geothermal lease issued under the provisions of this chapter which are not associated with the geothermal resources of such lands as defined in [section 1001(c) of this title][/us/usc/t30/s1001/c] shall be locatable under said mining laws in accordance with the principles of the Multiple Mineral Development Act ([68 Stat. 708][/us/stat/68/708]; found in [30 U.S.C. 521][/us/usc/t30/s521] et seq.).

([Pub. L. 91–581, § 6][/us/pl/91/581/s6], Dec. 24, 1970, [84 Stat. 1568][/us/stat/84/1568]; [Pub. L. 100–443][/us/pl/100/443], §§ 2(b), 3, Sept. 22, 1988, [102 Stat. 1766][/us/stat/102/1766]; [Pub.

 __Codification__ 

    August 8, 2005, referred to in introductory provisions of subsec. (d), was in the original “the date of the enactment of this subsection” and “the date of enactment of this subsection”, which was translated as meaning the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58], which substantially amended this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    2005—[Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] inserted section catchline, added subsecs. (a) to (f), redesignated former subsecs. (c), (d), and (f) as (g), (h), and (i), respectively, substituted “geothermal resources” for “geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources” in subsec. (i), and struck out former subsecs. (a), (b), (e), and (g) to (j), which related to primary and continuation terms, renewals, conversions to mineral leases, five-year extensions, bona fide effort requirement for extensions, payments in lieu of commercial quantities production, and significant expenditure, respectively.

    1988—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 100–443, § 2(b)][/us/pl/100/443/s2/b], amended subsec. (d) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (d) read as follows: “For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, production or utilization of geothermal steam in commercial quantities shall be deemed to include the completion of one or more wells producing or capable of producing geothermal steam in commercial quantities and a bona fide sale of such geothermal steam for delivery to or utilization by a facility or facilities not yet installed but scheduled for installation not later than fifteen years from the date of commencement of the primary term of the lease.”

    Subsecs. (g) to (j). [Pub. L. 100–443, § 3][/us/pl/100/443/s3], added subsecs. (g) to (j).
