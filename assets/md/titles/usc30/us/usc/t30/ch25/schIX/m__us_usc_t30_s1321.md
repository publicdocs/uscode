 __Codification__ 

    In subsec. (a), the words “(hereafter referred to as ‘Administrator’ in this subchapter),” which followed “Secretary of Energy” the first time it appears were omitted in view of the substitution of “Secretary of Energy” for “Administrator ERDA” and “Administrator” wherever such terms appear in this subchapter and the fact that the term “Secretary” is defined for the purposes of this chapter by [section 1291(23) of this title][/us/usc/t30/s1291/23] as meaning the Secretary of the Interior. See Transfer of Functions note set out below.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    “Secretary of Energy” substituted in text for “Administrator ERDA” and “Administrator”, meaning Administrator of Energy Research and Development Administration, pursuant to sections 301(a), 703, and 707 of [Pub. L. 95–91][/us/pl/95/91], which are classified to sections 7151(a), 7293, 7297 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, and which terminated Energy Research and Development Administration and transferred its functions and functions of Administrator thereof (with certain exceptions) to Secretary of Energy.

    “Secretary of Education” substituted for “Commissioner of Education” in subsec. (a), pursuant to sections 301(a)(1) and 507 of [Pub. L. 96–88][/us/pl/96/88], which are classified to sections 3441(a)(1) and 3507 of Title 20, Education, and which transferred all functions of Commissioner of Education to Secretary of Education.
