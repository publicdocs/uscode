([Feb. 25, 1920, ch. 85, § 37][/us/act/1920-02-25/ch85/s37], [41 Stat. 451][/us/stat/41/451]; [Feb. 7, 1927, ch. 66, § 5][/us/act/1927-02-07/ch66/s5], [44 Stat. 1058][/us/stat/44/1058]; [Aug. 8, 1946, ch. 916, § 11][/us/act/1946-08-08/ch916/s11], [60 Stat. 957][/us/stat/60/957]; [Pub. L. 95–554, § 4][/us/pl/95/554/s4], Oct. 30, 1978, [92 Stat. 2074][/us/stat/92/2074].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section was from act Feb. 25, 1920, in which words now reading “in Lander, Wyoming, coal entries numbered 18 to 49, inclusive,” originally read “described in the joint resolution entitled ‘Joint resolution authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to permit the continuation of coal mining operations on certain lands in Wyoming,’ approved August 12, 1912, (Thirty-seven Statutes at Large p. 1346).” The change was effected by interpolation, in lieu of the reference to the 1912 resolution, the actual description of lands contained in said resolution.

 __Amendments__ 

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–554][/us/pl/95/554] provided for disposition of minerals as provided in sections 1716 and 1719 of title 43.

    1946—Act Aug. 8, 1946, excluded from section 5 of act Feb. 7, 1927, the incorporation, by reference, of [section 181 of this title][/us/usc/t30/s181], and reenacted inclusion of deposits of potassium.

    1927—Act Feb. 7, 1927, included deposits of potassium.
