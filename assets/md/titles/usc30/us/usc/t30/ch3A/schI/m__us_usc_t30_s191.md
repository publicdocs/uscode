 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 106–393, title V][/us/pl/106/393/tV], § 502, Oct. 30, 2000, [114 Stat. 1624][/us/stat/114/1624], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) Section 10201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ([Public Law 103–66][/us/pl/103/66]; [107 Stat. 407][/us/stat/107/407]) amended section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act ([30 U.S.C. 191][/us/usc/t30/s191]) to change the sharing of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from geothermal steam from a 50:50 split between the Federal Government and the States to a complicated formula that entailed deducting from the State share of leasing revenues ‘50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriations of the Department of the Interior and any other agency during the preceding fiscal year allocable to the administration of all laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States for the production of the same types of minerals leasable under this Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws \* \* \*’.

>     “(2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound public policy rationale for deducting prior-year administrative expenses from the sharing of current-year receipts, indicating that this change was made primarily for budget scoring reasons.

>     “(3) The system put in place by this change in law has proved difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes between the Federal Government and the States as to the nature of allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have proven to be poorly suited to breaking down administrative costs in the manner required by the law. Different Federal agencies implementing this law have used varying methodologies to identify allocable costs, resulting in an inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal years 1994 through 1996. In November 1997, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior found that ‘the congressionally approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in fiscal year 1997 may not accurately compute the deductions’.

>     “(4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993 change in law and the complexity and administrative burden involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \[Aug. 10, 1993\] is justified.”

 __Funds Held by Colorado and Utah From Interior Department Oil Shale Test Leases__ 

[Pub. L. 94–579, title III][/us/pl/94/579/tIII], § 317(b), Oct. 21, 1976, [90 Stat. 2771][/us/stat/90/2771], provided that: 

> “Funds now held pursuant to said section 35 \[this section\] by the States of Colorado and Utah separately from the Department of the Interior oil shale test leases known as C–A; C–B; U–A and U–B shall be used by such States and subdivisions as the legislature of each State may direct giving priority to those subdivisions socially or economically impacted by the development of minerals leased under this Act for (1) planning, (2) construction and maintenance of public facilities, and (3) provision of public services.”

 __Admission of Alaska as State__ 

    Effectiveness of amendment by [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508] was dependent on admission of Alaska into the Union under sections 6(k) and 8(b) of [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508]. Admission was accomplished Jan. 3, 1959, on issuance of Proc. No. 3269, Jan. 3, 1959, 24 F.R. 81, 73 Stat. c16, as required by sections 1 and 8(c) of [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508]. See notes preceding [section 21 of Title 48][/us/usc/t48/s21], Territories and Insular Possessions.

 __Outer Continental Shelf; Revenues From Leases__
