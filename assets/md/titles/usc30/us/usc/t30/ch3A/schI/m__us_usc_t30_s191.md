All moneys received under the provisions of this chapter and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 not otherwise disposed of by this section shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.

Such warrants shall be issued by the United States Treasury not later than 10 days after receipt of such moneys by the Treasury. Moneys placed in a suspense account which are determined to be payable to a State shall be made not later than the last business day of the month in which such dispute is resolved. Any such amount placed in a suspense account pending resolution shall bear interest until the dispute is resolved.

    (b) __Deduction for administrative costs__ 

        In determining the amount of payments to the States under this section, beginning in fiscal year 2014 and for each year thereafter, the amount of such payments shall be reduced by 2 percent for any administrative or other costs incurred by the United States in carrying out the program authorized by this chapter, and the amount of such reduction shall be deposited to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.

        (2)

         Of the amounts deposited in the Treasury under paragraph (1)—

            (A) 50 percent shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the State within the boundaries of which the leased land is located or the deposits were derived; and

        (3) For each of fiscal years 2006 through 2015, the Fund shall be available to the Secretary of the Interior for expenditure, without further appropriation and without fiscal year limitation, for the coordination and processing of oil and gas use authorizations on onshore Federal land under the jurisdiction of the Pilot Project offices identified in [section 15924(d) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s15924/d].

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 106–393, title V, § 502][/us/pl/106/393/s502], Oct. 30, 2000, [114 Stat. 1624][/us/stat/114/1624], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) Section 10201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ([Public Law 103–66][/us/pl/103/66]; [107 Stat. 407][/us/stat/107/407]) amended section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act ([30 U.S.C. 191][/us/usc/t30/s191]) to change the sharing of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from geothermal steam from a 50:50 split between the Federal Government and the States to a complicated formula that entailed deducting from the State share of leasing revenues ‘50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriations of the Department of the Interior and any other agency during the preceding fiscal year allocable to the administration of all laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States for the production of the same types of minerals leasable under this Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws \* \* \*’.

>     “(2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound public policy rationale for deducting prior-year administrative expenses from the sharing of current-year receipts, indicating that this change was made primarily for budget scoring reasons.

>     “(3) The system put in place by this change in law has proved difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes between the Federal Government and the States as to the nature of allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have proven to be poorly suited to breaking down administrative costs in the manner required by the law. Different Federal agencies implementing this law have used varying methodologies to identify allocable costs, resulting in an inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal years 1994 through 1996. In November 1997, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior found that ‘the congressionally approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in fiscal year 1997 may not accurately compute the deductions’.

>     “(4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993 change in law and the complexity and administrative burden involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \[Aug. 10, 1993\] is justified.”

 __Funds Held by Colorado and Utah From Interior Department Oil Shale Test Leases__ 

[Pub. L. 94–579, title III, § 317(b)][/us/pl/94/579/s317/b], Oct. 21, 1976, [90 Stat. 2771][/us/stat/90/2771], provided that: 

> “Funds now held pursuant to said section 35 \[this section\] by the States of Colorado and Utah separately from the Department of the Interior oil shale test leases known as C–A; C–B; U–A and U–B shall be used by such States and subdivisions as the legislature of each State may direct giving priority to those subdivisions socially or economically impacted by the development of minerals leased under this Act for (1) planning, (2) construction and maintenance of public facilities, and (3) provision of public services.”

 __Admission of Alaska as State__ 

    Effectiveness of amendment by [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508] was dependent on admission of Alaska into the Union under sections 6(k) and 8(b) of [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508]. Admission was accomplished Jan. 3, 1959, on issuance of Proc. No. 3269, Jan. 3, 1959, 24 F.R. 81, 73 Stat. c16, as required by sections 1 and 8(c) of [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508]. See notes preceding [section 21 of Title 48][/us/usc/t48/s21], Territories and Insular Possessions.

 __Outer Continental Shelf; Revenues From Leases__ 

    Disposition of revenues from leases on submerged lands of outer Continental Shelf, see sections 1337 and 1338 of Title 43, Public Lands.
