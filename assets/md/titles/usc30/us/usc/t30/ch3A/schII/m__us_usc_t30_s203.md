    (c) __Royalties__ 

        The minimum royalty provisions of [section 207(a) of this title][/us/usc/t30/s207/a] shall not apply to any lands covered by this modified lease prior to a modification until the term of the original lease or extension thereof which became effective prior to the effective date of this Act has expired.

([Feb. 25, 1920, ch. 85][/us/act/1920-02-25/ch85], § 3, [41 Stat. 439][/us/stat/41/439]; [Pub. L. 94–377][/us/pl/94/377], § 13(b), Aug. 4, 1976, [90 Stat. 1090][/us/stat/90/1090]; [Pub. L. 95–554][/us/pl/95/554], § 3, Oct. 30, 1978, [92 Stat. 2074][/us/stat/92/2074]; [Pub. L. 109–58, title IV][/us/pl/109/58/tIV], § 432, Aug. 8, 2005, [119 Stat. 760][/us/stat/119/760].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 202a(2) and 207(c) of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “section 2(d)(2) and 7(c) of this Act ([30 U.S.C. 201(d)(2)][/us/usc/t30/s201/d/2] and 207(c))”, and was translated as sections 202a(2) and 207(c) of this title to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    The effective date of this Act, referred to in subsec. (c), probably means the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 95–554][/us/pl/95/554], which was approved Oct. 30, 1978.

(a), substituted “Except as provided in paragraph (3), on a finding by the Secretary under paragraph (2), any person” for “Any person” and “secure modifications of the original coal lease by including additional coal lands or coal deposits contiguous or cornering to those embraced in the lease” for “upon a finding by him that it would be in the interest of the United States, secure modifications of the original coal lease by including additional coal lands or coal deposits contiguous or cornering to those embraced in such lease, but in no event shall the total area added by such modifications to an existing coal lease exceed one hundred sixty acres, or add acreage larger than that in the original lease”, added pars. (2) and (3), and designated second and third sentences as subsecs. (b) and (c), respectively.

L. 95–554][/us/pl/95/554] authorized modification of leases to include coal lands or coal deposits cornering to those embraced in the leases and inserted provision respecting application of production or mining plan requirements of sections 202a(2) and 207(c) and minimum royalty provisions of [section 207(a) of this title][/us/usc/t30/s207/a].

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–377][/us/pl/94/377] struck out the advantage to the lessee as one of the conditions for modification of the original lease, substituted provision prohibiting the addition of total area in excess of 160 acres or adding acreage larger than that in the original lease for provision limiting the total area embraced in such modified lease to an aggregate of 2560 acres, and inserted provision authorizing the Secretary to prescribe terms and conditions consistent with this chapter which shall be applicable to the total acreage in the modified lease.
