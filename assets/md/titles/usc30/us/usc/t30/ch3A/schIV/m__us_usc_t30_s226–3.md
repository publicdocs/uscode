## § 226–3. Lands not subject to oil and gas leasing

    (a) __Prohibition__ 

    The Secretary shall not issue any lease under this chapter or under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 \[[30 U.S.C. 1001][/us/usc/t30/s1001] et seq.\] on any of the following Federal lands:

        (1) Lands recommended for wilderness allocation by the surface managing agency.

        (2) Lands within Bureau of Land Management wilderness study areas.

        (3) Lands designated by Congress as wilderness study areas, except where oil and gas leasing is specifically allowed to continue by the statute designating the study area.

        (4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further planning in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress (House Document numbered 96–119), unless such lands are allocated to uses other than wilderness by a land and resource management plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an act of Congress.

    (b) __Exploration__ 

        In the case of any area of National Forest or public lands subject to this section, nothing in this section shall affect any authority of the Secretary of the Interior (or for National Forest Lands reserved from the public domain, the Secretary of Agriculture) to issue permits for exploration for oil and gas, coal, oil shale, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, gilsonite or geothermal resources by means not requiring construction of roads or improvement of existing roads if such activity is conducted in a manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment.

([Feb. 25, 1920, ch. 85, § 43][/us/act/1920-02-25/ch85/s43], as added [Pub. L. 100–203, title V, § 5112][/us/pl/100/203/s5112], Dec. 22, 1987, [101 Stat. 1330–262][/us/stat/101/1330-262]; amended [Pub. L. 100–443, § 5(c)][/us/pl/100/443/s5/c], Sept. 22, 1988, [102 Stat. 1768][/us/stat/102/1768].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, referred to in subsec. (a), is [Pub. L. 91–581][/us/pl/91/581], Dec. 24, 1970, [84 Stat. 1566][/us/stat/84/1566], which is classified principally to chapter 23 (§ 1001 et seq.) of this title.

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 100–443, § 5(c)(1)][/us/pl/100/443/s5/c/1], inserted “or under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970” after “under this chapter” and directed that “oil and gas” be stricken which was executed by striking those words where they appeared after “not issue any” in introductory provisions, but not where they appeared in par. (3) as the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 100–443, § 5(c)(2)][/us/pl/100/443/s5/c/2], inserted “, coal, oil shale, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, gilsonite or geothermal resources” after “oil and gas”.
