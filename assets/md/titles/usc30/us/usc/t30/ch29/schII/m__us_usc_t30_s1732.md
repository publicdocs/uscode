        (2) each Indian tribe shall, upon request, have access to all royalty accounting information in the possession of the Secretary respecting the production, removal, or sale of oil or gas from leases on Indian lands under the jurisdiction of such tribe.

        Information shall be made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) as soon as practicable after it comes into the possession of the Secretary.
