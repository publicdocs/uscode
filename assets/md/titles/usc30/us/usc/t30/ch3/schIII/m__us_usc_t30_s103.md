## § 103. Patents for oil or gas lands not denied because of transfer before discovery of oil or gas; acreage limitation; nonapplication to withdraw lands

    In no case shall patent be denied to or for any lands located or claimed prior to March 2, 1911, under the mining laws of the United States containing petroleum, mineral oil, or gas solely because of any transfer or assignment thereof or of any interest or interests therein by the original locator or locators, or any of them, to any qualified persons or person or corporation, prior to discovery of oil or gas therein, but if such claim is in all other respects valid and regular, patent therefor not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres in any one claim shall issue to the holder or holders thereof, as in other cases. The above provisions shall not apply where such lands were at the time of inception of development on or under such claim withdrawn from mineral entry.
