        (9) to study the relationship between coal or other mine environments and occupational diseases of miners;

        (10) to develop new and improved underground equipment and other sources of power for such equipment which will provide greater safety;

        (11) to determine, upon the written request by any operator or authorized representative of miners, specifying with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which such request is made, whether any substance normally found in a coal or other mine has potentially toxic effects in the concentrations normally found in the coal or other mine or whether any physical agents or equipment found or used in a coal or other mine has potentially hazardous effects, and shall submit such determinations to both the operators and miners as soon as possible; and

        (12) for such other purposes as they deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

    (d) __Prevention of diseases affecting persons working with mine products__ 

        The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall also conduct studies and research into matters involving the protection of life and the prevention of diseases in connection with persons, who although not miners, work with, or around the products of, coal or other mines in areas outside of such mines and under conditions which may adversely affect the health and well-being of such persons.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__
