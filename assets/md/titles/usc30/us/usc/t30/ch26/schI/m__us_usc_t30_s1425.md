    (a) __Relinquishment and surrender__ 

    Any licensee or permittee may at any time, without penalty—

        (1) surrender to the Administrator a license or a permit issued to the licensee or permittee; or

        (2) relinquish to the Administrator, in whole or in part, any right to conduct any exploration or commercial recovery activities authorized by the license or permit.

        Any licensee or permittee who surrenders a license or permit, or relinquishes any such right, shall remain liable with respect to all violations and penalties incurred, and damage to persons or property caused, by the licensee or permittee as a result of activities engaged in by the licensee or permittee under such license or permit.

    (b) __Transfer__ 

        Any license or permit, upon written request of the licensee or permittee, may be transferred by the Administrator; except that no such transfer may occur unless the proposed transferee is a United States citizen and until the Administrator determines that (1) the proposed transfer is in the public interest, and (2) the proposed transferee and the exploration or commercial recovery activities the transferee proposes to conduct meet the requirements of this chapter and regulations issued under this chapter.
