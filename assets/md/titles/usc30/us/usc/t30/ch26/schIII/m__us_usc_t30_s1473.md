    Except as otherwise provided in sections 4495 to 4498  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 26, nothing in this chapter shall affect the application of title 26. Nothing in this chapter shall affect the application of the customs or tariff laws of the United States.

([Pub. L. 96–283, title IV][/us/pl/96/283/tIV], § 404, June 28, 1980, [94 Stat. 586][/us/stat/94/586]; [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514], § 2, Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 4495 to 4498 of title 26, referred to in text, were in the original “section 402”, meaning [section 402 of Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283/s402], title IV, June 28, 1980, [94 Stat. 582][/us/stat/94/582], which enacted sections 4495 to 4498 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code, and enacted a provision set out as a note under [section 4495 of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s4495]. Sections 4495 to 4498 of title 26 were repealed by [Pub. L. 105–34, title XIV][/us/pl/105/34/tXIV], § 1432(b)(1), Aug. 5, 1997, [111 Stat. 1050][/us/stat/111/1050].

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283], June 28, 1980, [94 Stat. 553][/us/stat/94/553], as amended, known as the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, which is classified principally to this chapter (§ 1401 et seq.). For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1401 of this title][/us/usc/t30/s1401] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of title IV of [Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283], and not as part of title III of [Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283] which comprises this subchapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
