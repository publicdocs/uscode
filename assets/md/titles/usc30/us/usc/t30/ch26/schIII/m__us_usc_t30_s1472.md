## § 1472. Deep Seabed Revenue Sharing Trust Fund; establishment

    (a) __Creation of Trust Fund__ 

        There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the “Deep Seabed Revenue Sharing Trust Fund” (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Trust Fund”), consisting of such amounts as may be appropriated or credited to the Trust Fund as provided in this section.

    (b) __Transfer to Trust Fund of amounts equivalent to certain taxes__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There are hereby appropriated to the Trust Fund amounts determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be equivalent to the amounts of the taxes received in the Treasury under section 4495  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 26.

        (2) __Method of transfer__ 

            The amounts appropriated by paragraph (1) shall be transferred at least quarterly from the general fund of the Treasury to the Trust Fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) received in the Treasury. Proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were in excess of or less than the amount required to be transferred.

    (c) __Management of Trust Fund__ 

        (1) __Report__ 

            It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to hold the Trust Fund, and to report to the Congress for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, and each fiscal year thereafter on the financial condition and the results of the operations of the Trust Fund during the preceding year and on its expected condition and operations during the fiscal year and the next five fiscal years after the fiscal year. Such report shall be printed as a House document of the session of the Congress to which the report is made.

        (2) __Investment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Trust Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired (i) on original issue at the issue price, or (ii) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price.

            (B) __Sale of obligations__ 

                Any obligation acquired by the Trust Fund may be sold by the Secretary at the market price.

            (C) __Interest on certain proceeds__ 

                The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Trust Fund.

    (d) __Expenditures from Trust Fund__ 

        If an international deep seabed treaty is ratified by and in effect with respect to the United States on or before the date ten years after June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available, as provided by appropriations Acts, for making contributions required under such treaty for purposes of the sharing among nations of the revenues from deep seabed mining. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize any program or other activity not otherwise authorized by law.

    (e) __Use of funds__ 

        If an international deep seabed treaty is not in effect with respect to the United States on or before the date ten years after June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available for such purposes as Congress may hereafter provide by law.

    (f) __International deep seabed treaty__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “international deep seabed treaty” has the meaning given to such term by section 4498(b) 1 of title 26.

([Pub. L. 96–283, title IV, § 403][/us/pl/96/283/s403], June 28, 1980, [94 Stat. 584][/us/stat/94/584]; [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 4495 and 4498 of title 26, referred to in subsecs. (b)(1) and (f), were repealed by [Pub. L. 105–34, title XIV, § 1432(b)(1)][/us/pl/105/34/s1432/b/1], Aug. 5, 1997, [111 Stat. 1050][/us/stat/111/1050].

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of title IV of [Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283], and not as part of title III of [Pub. L. 96–283][/us/pl/96/283], which comprises this subchapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

 __Termination of Reporting Requirements__ 

    For termination, effective May 15, 2000, of provisions in subsec. (c)(1) of this section relating to the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to Congress, see [section 3003 of Pub. L. 104–66][/us/pl/104/66/s3003], as amended, set out as a note under [section 1113 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1113], Money and Finance, and page 143 of House Document No. 103–7.
