    (a) Subject to the provisions of section 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing Act ([30 U.S.C. 191(b)][/us/usc/t30/s191/b]), all receipts derived from leases issued under the authority of this chapter shall be paid into the same funds or accounts in the Treasury and shall be distributed in the same manner as prescribed for other receipts from the lands affected by the lease, the intention of this provision being that this chapter shall not affect the distribution of receipts pursuant to legislation applicable to such lands: Provided, however, That receipts from leases or permits for minerals in lands set apart for Indian use, including lands the jurisdiction of which has been transferred to the Department of the Interior by the Executive order for Indian use, shall be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury until final disposition thereof by the Congress. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, all receipts derived from leases on lands acquired for military or naval purposes, except the naval petroleum reserves and national oil shale reserves, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States and disposed of in the same manner as provided under [section 35 of the Act of February 25, 1920][/us/act/1920-02-25/s35] ([41 Stat. 450][/us/stat/41/450]; [30 U.S.C. 191][/us/usc/t30/s191]), in the case of receipts from sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals of the public lands under that Act \[[30 U.S.C. 181][/us/usc/t30/s181] et seq.\].

    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any payment to a State under this section shall be made by the Secretary of the Interior and shall be made not later than the last business day of the month following the month in which such moneys or associated reports are received by the Secretary of the Interior, whichever is later. The preceding sentence shall also apply to any payment to a State derived from a lease for mineral resources issued by the Secretary of the Interior under [section 520 of title 16][/us/usc/t16/s520]. The Secretary shall pay interest to a State on any amount not paid to the State within that time at the rate prescribed under section 1721  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title from the date payment was required to be made under this subsection until the date payment is made.
