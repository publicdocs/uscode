        (2) to assist in establishing responsibilities for, and to coordinate, Federal materials-related policies, programs, and research and technology activities, as well as recommending to the Office of Management and Budget budget priorities for materials activities in each of the Federal departments and agencies;

        (3) to review and appraise the various programs and activities of the Federal Government in accordance with the policy and directions given in the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 ([30 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t30/s1601]) \[[30 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t30/s1601] et seq.\], and to determine the extent to which such programs and activities are contributing to the achievement of such policy and directions;

        (4) to monitor and evaluate the critical materials needs of basic and advanced technology industries and the Government, including the critical materials research and development needs of the private and public sectors;

        (5) to advise the President of mineral and material  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “materials”. </sup></sup>  trends, both domestic and foreign, the implications thereof for the United States and world economies and the national security, and the probable effects of such trends on domestic industries;

        (6) to assess through consultation with the materials academic community the adequacy and quality of materials-related educational institutions and the supply of materials scientists and engineers;

        (7) to make or furnish such studies, analyses, reports, and recommendations with respect to matters of materials-related policy and legislation as the President may request;

        (8)

            (A) to prepare a report providing a domestic inventory of critical materials with projections on the prospective needs of Government and industry for these materials, including a long-range assessment, prepared in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980, and in conjunction with such other Government departments or agencies as may be considered necessary, of the prospective major critical materials problems which the United States is likely to confront in the immediate years ahead and providing advice as to how these problems may best be addressed, with the first such report being due on April 1, 1985, and (B) review and update such report and assessment as appropriate and report thereon to the Congress at least biennially; and

        (9) to recommend to the Congress such changes in current policies, activities, and regulations of the Federal Government, and such legislation, as may be considered necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter and the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980.

    (b) __Specific authorities of Council__ 

    In carrying out its responsibilities under this section the Council shall have the authority—

        (1) to establish such special advisory panels as it considers necessary, with each such panel consisting of representatives of industry, academia, and other members of the private sector, not to exceed ten members, and being limited in scope of subject and duration; and

        (2) to establish and convene such Federal interagency committees as it considers necessary in carrying out the intent of this chapter.

    (c) __Collaboration and cooperation of Council and Federal agencies with responsibilities related to materials__ 

        In seeking to achieve the goals of this chapter and related Acts, the Council and other Federal departments and agencies with responsibilities or jurisdiction related to materials or materials policy, including the National Security Council, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall work collaboratively and in close cooperation.

 __Review of Research and Development Priorities in Superconductors__ 

[Pub. L. 100–418, title V][/us/pl/100/418/tV], § 5143, Aug. 23, 1988, [102 Stat. 1446][/us/stat/102/1446], provided that:

>     “(a)  __National Commission on Superconductivity__  __.—__ 

>     The President shall appoint a National Commission on Superconductivity to review all major policy issues regarding United States applications of recent research advances in superconductors in order to assist the Congress in devising a national strategy, including research and development priorities, the development of which will assure United States leadership in the development and application of superconducting technologies.

>     “(b)  __Membership__  __.—__ 

>     The membership of the National Commission on Superconductivity shall include representatives of—

>         “(1) the National Critical Materials Council, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce (including the National Institute of Standards and Technology), the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Defense;

>         “(2) organizations whose membership is comprised of physicists, engineers, chemical scientists, or material scientists; and

>         “(3) industries, universities, and national laboratories engaged in superconductivity research.

>     “(c)  __Chairman__  __.—__ 

>     A representative of the private sector shall be designated as chairman of the Commission.

>     “(d)  __Coordination__  __.—__ 

>     The National Critical Materials Council shall be the coordinating body of the National Commission on Superconductivity and shall provide staff support for the Commission.

>     “(e)  __Report__  __.—__ 

>     Within 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Aug. 23, 1988\], the National Commission on Superconductivity shall submit a report to the President and the Congress with recommendations regarding methods of enhancing the research, development, and implementation of improved superconductor technologies in all major applications.

>     “(f)  __Scope of Review__  __.—__ 

>     In preparing the report required by subsection (e), the Commission shall consider addressing, but need not limit, its review to—

>         “(1) the state of United States competitiveness in the development of improved superconductors;

>         “(2) methods to improve and coordinate the collection and dissemination of research data relating to superconductivity;

>         “(3) methods to improve and coordinate funding of research and development of improved superconductors;
