## § 5302. Stabilizing exchange rates and arrangements

    (a)

        (1) The Department of the Treasury has a stabilization fund. The fund is available to carry out this section, section 18 of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act ([22 U.S.C. 286e–3][/us/usc/t22/s286e–3]), and section 3 of the Special Drawing Rights Act ([22 U.S.C. 286][/us/usc/t22/s286]o), and for investing in obligations of the United States Government those amounts in the fund the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, decides are not required at the time to carry out this section. Proceeds of sales and investments, earnings, and interest shall be paid into the fund and are available to carry out this section. However, the fund is not available to pay administrative expenses.

        (2) Subject to approval by the President, the fund is under the exclusive control of the Secretary, and may not be used in a way that direct control and custody pass from the President and the Secretary. Decisions of the Secretary are final and may not be reviewed by another officer or employee of the Government.

    (b) Consistent with the obligations of the Government in the International Monetary Fund on orderly exchange arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates, the Secretary or an agency designated by the Secretary, with the approval of the President, may deal in gold, foreign exchange, and other instruments of credit and securities the Secretary considers necessary. However, a loan or credit to a foreign entity or government of a foreign country may be made for more than 6 months in any 12-month period only if the President gives Congress a written statement that unique or emergency circumstances require the loan or credit be for more than 6 months.

    (c)

        (1) By the 30th day after the end of each month, the Secretary shall give the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a detailed financial statement on the stabilization fund showing all agreements made or renewed, all transactions occurring during the month, and all projected liabilities.

        (2) The Secretary shall report each year to the President and Congress on the operation of the fund.

    (d) A repayment of any part of the first subscription payment of the Government to the International Monetary Fund, previously paid from the stabilization fund, shall be deposited in the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt.

    Memorandum of President of the United States, June 29, 1995, 60 F.R. 35113, provided:

    Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury

    On January 31, 1995, I approved a program of assistance to Mexico, in the form of swap facilities and securities guarantees in an amount not to exceed $20 billion, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (the “ESF program”).

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including [section 301 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], United States Code, and section 406 of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions for the Department of Defense to Preserve and Enhance Military Readiness Act of 1995 ([Public Law 104–6][/us/pl/104/6]) \[set out above\], I hereby certify that:

    (1) There is no projected cost (as defined in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 \[[2 U.S.C. 661][/us/usc/t2/s661] et seq.\]) to the United States from the proposed swap transaction.

    (2) All loans, credits, guarantees, and currency swaps to Mexico from the Exchange Stabilization Fund or the Federal Reserve System are adequately backed to ensure that all United States funds are repaid.

    (3) The Government of Mexico is making progress in ensuring an independent central bank.

    (4) Mexico has in effect a significant economic reform effort.

    (5) The Executive Branch has provided the documents requested by House Resolution 80 adopted March 1, 1995, and described in paragraphs (1) through (28) of that Resolution. All documents identified as responsive to the Resolution have been provided to the entire House of Representatives. Pursuant to the terms of the Resolution, the Executive Branch has not provided those documents as to which the Executive Branch has informed the House that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to provide the documents to the House. Pursuant to arrangements for safekeeping of classified materials in House facilities, classified documents have been provided to the House by making them available either at designated, secure House facilities or at Executive Branch facilities. Each agency, including the Federal Reserve Board, has advised the House of the procedures employed by that agency to provide the documents requested by House Resolution 80.

    I have been informed that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has provided the documents requested by House Resolution 80 and described in paragraphs (1) through (28) of that Resolution.

    I hereby delegate to you the reporting requirement contained in [section 406 of Public Law 104–6][/us/pl/104/6/s406] \[set out above\]. You are authorized and requested to report this certification immediately to the Speaker of the House and appropriate congressional committees, as defined in [section 407 of Public Law 104–6][/us/pl/104/6/s407] \[set out above\].

    I also hereby delegate to you the reporting requirement contained in [section 403 of Public Law 104–6][/us/pl/104/6/s403] \[set out above\].

    You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

                              William J. Clinton.
