For a violation of [section 5318(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5318/a/2] or a regulation prescribed under section 5318(a)(2), a separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues and at each office, branch, or place of business at which a violation occurs or continues.

A civil penalty under this paragraph may not be more than the amount of the monetary instrument for which the report was required.

    In subsection (a)(1), the words “or a regulation prescribed under this subchapter” are added because of the restatement. The words “(except [section 5315 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5315] or a regulation prescribed under section 5315)” are added because 31:1141–1143 was not enacted as a part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in this subchapter. The words “is liable to the United States Government for” are substituted for “the Secretary may assess upon” in 31:1056(a) for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “the purposes of both civil and criminal penalties for” in 31:1054(b)(last sentence)(related to civil penalties) are omitted, and the words “or a regulation prescribed under section 5318(2)” are added, because of the restatement. The words “the violation continues” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The word “separate” before “office” is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(2), the word “impose” is substituted for “assess” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The word “additional” is substituted for 31:1103 (last sentence words before last comma) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “or a regulation prescribed under section 5316” are added because of the restatement. The words “amount of this”, “to be filed”, and “actually” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (a)(3) is substituted for 31:1143(a) and (b)(words after last comma) for clarity and consistency and because of the restatement.

    In subsection (b), the words “in the discretion of”, “in the name of the United States”, and “of any person” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the words “in his discretion” and “upon such terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just” are omitted as surplus. The word “civil” is added for clarity.
