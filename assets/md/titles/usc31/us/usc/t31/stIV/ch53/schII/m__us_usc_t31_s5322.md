    In subsections (a) and (b), the words “(except [section 5315 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5315] or a regulation prescribed under section 5315)” are added because 31:1141–1143 was not enacted as part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in the subchapter.

    In subsection (a), the word “prescribed” is added for consistency.

    In subsection (b), the words “or a regulation prescribed under this subchapter” are added because of the restatement. The words “committed” and “the commission of” are omitted as surplus. The words “United States” are substituted for “Federal” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (c), the words “the purposes of both civil and criminal penalties for” are omitted because of the restatement. The word “separate” before “office” is omitted as surplus.
