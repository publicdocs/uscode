            (A) with the institution involved in the transaction if the institution was designated;

            (B) in the way the Secretary prescribes when the institution was not designated; or

            (C) with the Secretary.

        (2)

         The Secretary shall prescribe—

            (A) the filing procedure for a domestic financial institution designated under subsection (b) of this section; and

In subsection (a), the words “coins or” are added, and the words “prescribe” and “prescribes” are substituted for “specify” in 31:1081, and “require”, for consistency. The words “other parties thereto or” in 31:1082 are omitted as surplus. The words “to the Secretary” in 31:1081 are omitted as unnecessary and for clarity. The words “in such detail” are omitted as surplus. The words “A participant acting for another person shall make the report as the agent or bailee of the person and identify the person for whom the transaction is being made” are substituted for 31:1082(last sentence) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “in his discretion” and “individually or by class” are omitted as surplus. The word “Government” is added for consistency. The words “or a regulation under this subchapter”, are added because of the restatement. The words “(except a violation of [section 5315 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5315] or a regulation prescribed under section 5315)” are added because 31:1141–1143 was not enacted as a part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in this subchapter.

    In subsection (c)(1), clause (A) is substituted for “with respect to a domestic financial institution . . . with that institution” for clarity. Clause (C) is substituted for “any such person may, at his election and in lieu of filing the report in the manner hereinabove prescribed, file the report with the Secretary” to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __Efficient Use of Currency Transaction Report System__ 

[Pub. L. 107–56, title III][/us/pl/107/56/tIII], § 366, Oct. 26, 2001, [115 Stat. 335][/us/stat/115/335], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Findings__  __.—__ 

>     The Congress finds the following:

>         “(1) The Congress established the currency transaction reporting requirements in 1970 because the Congress found then that such reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings and the usefulness of such reports has only increased in the years since the requirements were established.

>         “(2)

>          In 1994, in response to reports and testimony that excess amounts of currency transaction reports were interfering with effective law enforcement, the Congress reformed the currency transaction report exemption requirements to provide—

>             “(A) mandatory exemptions for certain reports that had little usefulness for law enforcement, such as cash transfers between depository institutions and cash deposits from government agencies; and

>             “(B) discretionary authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to provide exemptions, subject to criteria and guidelines established by the Secretary, for financial institutions with regard to regular business customers that maintain accounts at an institution into which frequent cash deposits are made.

>         “(3) Today there is evidence that some financial institutions are not utilizing the exemption system, or are filing reports even if there is an exemption in effect, with the result that the volume of currency transaction reports is once again interfering with effective law enforcement.

>     “(b) __Study and Report.—__ 

>         “(1)  __Study required__  __.—__ 

>         The Secretary shall conduct a study of—

>             “(A) the possible expansion of the statutory exemption system in effect under [section 5313 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s5313], United States Code; and

>             “(B) methods for improving financial institution utilization of the statutory exemption provisions as a way of reducing the submission of currency transaction reports that have little or no value for law enforcement purposes, including improvements in the systems in effect at financial institutions for regular review of the exemption procedures used at the institution and the training of personnel in its effective use.

>         “(2)  __Report required__  __.—__ 

>         The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act \[Oct. 26, 2001\] containing the findings and conclusions of the Secretary with regard to the study required under subsection (a), and such recommendations for legislative or administrative action as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.”

 __Report Reduction Goal; Streamlined Currency Transaction Reports__ 

[Pub. L. 103–325, title IV][/us/pl/103/325/tIV], § 402(b), (c), Sept. 23, 1994, [108 Stat. 2245][/us/stat/108/2245], provided that:

>     “(b) __Report Reduction Goal; Reports.—__ 

>         “(1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

>         In implementing the amendment made by subsection (a) \[amending this section\], the Secretary of the Treasury shall seek to reduce, within a reasonable period of time, the number of reports required to be filed in the aggregate by depository institutions pursuant to [section 5313(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s5313/a], United States Code, by at least 30 percent of the number filed during the year preceding the date of enactment of this Act \[Sept. 23, 1994\].

>         “(2)  __Interim report__  __.—__ 

>         The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act on the progress made by the Secretary in implementing the amendment made by subsection (a).

>         “(3)  __Annual report__  __.—__ 

>         The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an annual report to the Congress after the end of each of the first 5 calendar years which begin after the date of enactment of this Act on the extent to which the Secretary has reduced the overall number of currency transaction reports filed with the Secretary pursuant to [section 5313(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s5313/a], United States Code, consistent with the purposes of such section and effective law enforcement.

>     “(c)  __Streamlined Currency Transaction Reports__  __.—__ 

>     The Secretary of the Treasury shall take such action as may be appropriate to—

>         “(1) redesign the format of reports required to be filed under [section 5313(a) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s5313/a], United States Code, by any financial institution (as defined in section 5312(a)(2) of such title) to eliminate the need to report information which has little or no value for law enforcement purposes; and

>         “(2) reduce the time and effort required to prepare such report for filing by any such financial institution under such section.”
