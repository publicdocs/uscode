    In the section, before clause (1), the words “have the responsibility to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter” in 31:1054(a) are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The words “(except under [section 5315 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5315] and regulations prescribed under section 5315)” are added because 31:1141–1143 was not enacted as a part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in this subchapter. In clause (1), the words “duties and powers” are substituted for “responsibilities” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “bank supervisory agency, or other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “by regulation” and “as he may deem” are omitted as surplus. The words “and regulations prescribed under this subchapter” are added because of the restatement. In clause (3), the word “prescribe” is substituted for “make” in 31:1055 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “otherwise imposed”, 31:1055(1st sentence), and the words “in his discretion” are omitted as surplus.
