    The word “money” is substituted for “dollars” for consistency in the revised title. The words “the International Monetary Fund” are omitted as obsolete because of [section 9 of the Act of October 19, 1976][/us/act/1976-10-19/s9] ([Pub. L. 94–564][/us/pl/94/564], [90 Stat. 2661][/us/stat/90/2661]).
