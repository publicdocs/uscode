## § 5317. Search and forfeiture of monetary instruments

The Secretary shall include a statement of information in support of the warrant. On a showing of probable cause, the court may issue a search warrant for a designated person or a designated or described place or physical object. This subsection does not affect the authority of the Secretary under another law.

            (B)  __Procedure__  __.—__ 

            Forfeitures under this paragraph shall be governed by the procedures established in section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act.

    In subsection (a), the words “The Secretary shall include a statement of information in support of the warrant” are substituted for 31:1105(a)(last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency. The word “for” is substituted for “authorizing the search of . . . all of the following” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “or more” are omitted as unnecessary because the singular includes the plural under 1:1. The words “or premises”, “letters, parcels, packages, or other”, and “vehicles” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), the words “either” and “the possession of” are omitted as surplus. The words “United States Postal Service” are substituted for “postal service” for consistency with title 39. The words “or retained in” are omitted as surplus.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec. (c)(1)(B), is classified to [section 853 of Title 21][/us/usc/t21/s853], Food and Drugs.
