    The words “All . . . regardless of when coined or issued” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The word “debts” is substituted for “debts, public and private” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “public charges, taxes, duties, and dues” are omitted as included in “debts”.

 __1983__  __Act__ 

    This restores to 31:5103 the reference to public charges, taxes, and dues because they are not considered to be debts. See, Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108, 111 U.S. 701, 706 (1884).

    1983—[Pub. L. 97–452][/us/pl/97/452] inserted “, public charges, taxes, and dues” after “all debts”.

 __Effective Date of 1983 Amendment__ 

    Amendment effective Sept. 13, 1982, see [section 2(i) of Pub. L. 97–452][/us/pl/97/452/s2/i], set out as a note under [section 3331 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3331].
