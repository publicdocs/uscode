    Before clause (1), the words “prescribe regulations” are substituted for “make and promulgate rules and regulations” in 31:822 and “issue . . . such rules and regulations” in 31:822b for consistency. In clause (1), the words “to carry out” are substituted for “covering any action taken or to be taken by the President under” in 31:822 to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (2), the words “or proper” in 31:822b and “the purposes of” are omitted as surplus. Reference to 31:821 is omitted as obsolete because silver is no longer coined. Reference to 31:824 is omitted as obsolete because 31:824 is executed and is not part of the revised title.
