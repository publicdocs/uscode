## § 5112. Denominations, specifications, and design of coins

    (a)

     The Secretary of the Treasury may mint and issue only the following coins:

        (1) a dollar coin that is 1.043 inches in diameter.

        (2) a half dollar coin that is 1.205 inches in diameter and weighs 11.34 grams.

        (3) a quarter dollar coin that is 0.955 inch in diameter and weighs 5.67 grams.

        (4) a dime coin that is 0.705 inch in diameter and weighs 2.268 grams.

        (5) a 5-cent coin that is 0.835 inch in diameter and weighs 5 grams.

        (6) except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, a one-cent coin that is 0.75 inch in diameter and weighs 3.11 grams.

        (7) A fifty dollar gold coin that is 32.7 millimeters in diameter, weighs 33.931 grams, and contains one troy ounce of fine gold.

        (8) A twenty-five dollar gold coin that is 27.0 millimeters in diameter, weighs 16.966 grams, and contains one-half troy ounce of fine gold.

        (9) A ten dollar gold coin that is 22.0 millimeters in diameter, weighs 8.483 grams, and contains one-fourth troy ounce of fine gold.

        (10) A five dollar gold coin that is 16.5 millimeters in diameter, weighs 3.393 grams, and contains one-tenth troy ounce of fine gold.

        (11) A $50 gold coin that is of an appropriate size and thickness, as determined by the Secretary, weighs 1 ounce, and contains 99.99 percent pure gold.

        (12) A $25 coin of an appropriate size and thickness, as determined by the Secretary, that weighs 1 troy ounce and contains .9995 fine palladium.

    (b) The half dollar, quarter dollar, and dime coins are clad coins with 3 layers of metal. The 2 identical outer layers are an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. The inner layer is copper. The outer layers are metallurgically bonded to the inner layer and weigh at least 30 percent of the weight of the coin. The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible, be minted and fabricated in the United States, and have similar metallic, anti-counterfeiting properties as United States coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997. The 5-cent coin is an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. In minting 5-cent coins, the Secretary shall use bars that vary not more than 2.5 percent from the percent of nickel required. Except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the one-cent coin is an alloy of 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc. In minting gold coins, the Secretary shall use alloys that vary not more than 0.1 percent from the percent of gold required. The specifications for alloys are by weight.

    (c) The Secretary may prescribe the weight and the composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent coin that the Secretary decides are appropriate when the Secretary decides that a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc are necessary to ensure an adequate supply of one-cent coins to meet the needs of the United States.

    (d)

        (1) United States coins shall have the inscription “In God We Trust”. The obverse side of each coin shall have the inscription “Liberty”. The reverse side of each coin shall have the inscriptions “United States of America” and “E Pluribus Unum” and a designation of the value of the coin. The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle. Subject to other provisions of this subsection, the obverse of any 5-cent coin issued after December 31, 2005, shall bear the likeness of Thomas Jefferson and the reverse of any such 5-cent coin shall bear an image of the home of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Congress, shall select appropriate designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar coin. The coins have an inscription of the year of minting or issuance. However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.

        (2) The Secretary shall prepare the devices, models, hubs, and dies for coins, emblems, devices, inscriptions, and designs authorized under this chapter. The Secretary may, after consulting with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts, adopt and prepare new designs or models of emblems or devices that are authorized in the same way as when new coins or devices are authorized. The Secretary may change the design or die of a coin only once within 25 years of the first adoption of the design, model, hub, or die for that coin. The Secretary may procure services under [section 3109 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3109] in carrying out this paragraph.

If no such palladium is available or if it is not economically feasible to obtain such palladium, the Secretary may obtain palladium for the palladium coins described in paragraph (12) of subsection (a) from other available sources.

            (B)  __Price of bullion__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the palladium under subparagraph (A).

        (3)  __Sale of coins__  __.—__ 

        Each coin issued under this subsection shall be sold for an amount the Secretary determines to be appropriate, but not less than the sum of—

            (A) the market value of the bullion at the time of sale; and

            (B) the cost of designing and issuing the coins, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, marketing, distribution, and shipping.

        (4)  __Treatment__  __.—__ 

        For purposes of section 5134 and 5136, all coins minted under this subsection shall be considered to be numismatic items.

        (5)  __Quality__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary may issue the coins described in paragraph (1) in both proof and uncirculated versions, except that, should the Secretary determine that it is appropriate to issue proof or uncirculated versions of such coin, the Secretary shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the surface treatment of each year’s proof or uncirculated version differs in some material way from that of the preceding year.

        (6)  __Design__  __.—__ 

        Coins minted and issued under this subsection shall bear designs on the obverse and reverse that are close likenesses of the work of famed American coin designer and medallic artist Adolph Alexander Weinman—

            (A) the obverse shall bear a high-relief likeness of the “Winged Liberty” design used on the obverse of the so-called “Mercury dime”;

            (B) the reverse shall bear a high-relief version of the reverse design of the 1907 American Institute of Architects medal; and

            (C) the coin shall bear such other inscriptions, including “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, “United States of America”, the denomination and weight of the coin and the fineness of the metal, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate and in keeping with the original design.

        (7)  __Mint facility__  __.—__ 

        Any United States mint, other than the United States Mint at West Point, New York, may be used to strike coins minted under this subsection other than any proof version of any such coin. If the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to issue any proof version of such coin, coins of such version shall be struck only at the United States Mint at West Point, New York.

        (8)  __Marketing study defined__  __.—__ 

        The market study described in paragraph (1) means an analysis of the market for palladium bullion investments conducted by a reputable, independent third party that demonstrates that there would be adequate demand for palladium bullion coins produced by the United States Mint to ensure that such coins could be minted and issued at no net cost to taxpayers.

    In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement. In clause (5), the words “that is 0.835 inch in diameter” are added because the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words “5 grams” are substituted for “seventy-seven and sixteen-hundredths grains troy” for consistency in the revised chapter. In clause (6), the words “that is 0.75 inch in diameter” are added because the Secretary has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words “except as provided under subsection (c) of this section” are added for clarity and because of the restatement. The words “3.11 grams” are substituted for “forty-eight grains” for consistency in the revised chapter.

    In subsection (b), the words “In minting 5-cent coins” are substituted for “in minor-coinage alloys” in 31:346 because 5-cent coins are the minor coins composed of nickel. The words “Secretary shall use” are substituted for “shall be used” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word “bars” is substituted for “ingots” for consistency in the revised chapter. The words “2.5 percent” are substituted for “twenty-five thousandths” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “from the percent of nickel required” are substituted for “the legal standard . . . in the proportion of nickel” because of the restatement. The words “In silver ingots, six-thousandths” are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words “In gold ingots, one-thousandth” in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words “Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section” are added for clarity and because of the restatement.

    In subsection (c), the words “a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc” are substituted for “such action” for clarity.

    In subsection (d)(1), the words “an impression emblematic of liberty” in 31:324 are omitted as obsolete. The words “The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle” are substituted for “and upon the reverse side shall be the figure or representation of an eagle . . . but on the dime, 5-, and 1-cent piece, the figure of the eagle shall be omitted”, and the words “The emblem on the obverse side of the dollar is” are substituted for “The one-dollar coin authorized by [section 391(c) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s391/c] shall bear on the obverse side” in 31:324b–1, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964” in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.

    In subsection (d)(2), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “engraver”, “Director of the Mint”, and “Director of the Mint . . . with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word “dies” is substituted for “from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints” and “original dies” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “inscription” is substituted for “legend” for consistency in the section. The words “Provided, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin” are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words “procure services under [section 3109 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3109] in carrying out this paragraph” are substituted for “engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia” are omitted as obsolete. The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (e)(2), the words “80 percent” are substituted for “eight hundred parts” in 31:391(d), and the words “20 percent” are substituted for “two hundred parts”, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “that are metallurgically bonded to” are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words “the late President of the United States” in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.

    In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words “Notwithstanding this section and [section 5111(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s5111/a/1] are substituted for “Notwithstanding any other provision of law” in 31:399 for clarity. In clause (B), the words “are an alloy of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper” are substituted for “be minted in accordance with the standard established in section 3514 of the Revised Statutes ([31 U.S.C. 321][/us/usc/t31/s321])” and 31:321 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity. In clause (C), the word “symbolizing” is substituted for “emblematic” for clarity.

    In subsection (f)(2), the words “under such regulations as he may prescribe” are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The word “Treasury” is substituted for “general fund of the Treasury” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    The text of 31:399(b)(3) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 5103 of the revised title.

>     “(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.

>     “(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.

>     “(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.

>     “(9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.

>     “(10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

 __Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 109–145, title I, § 101][/us/pl/109/145/s101], Dec. 22, 2005, [119 Stat. 2664][/us/stat/119/2664], provided that: 

> “Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.

>     “(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.

>     “(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program ([31 U.S.C. 5112][/us/usc/t31/s5112](l)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.

>     “(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.

>     “(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.

>     “(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President’s spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.

>     “(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.

>     “(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.

>     “(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.

>     “(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called ‘mint marks’ that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called ‘Golden Age of Coinage’ in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

>     “(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.

>     “(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.

>     “(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.”

> “SEC. 301. __FINDINGS.__ 

> “Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation’s greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation’s history.

>     “(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.

>     “(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.

>     “(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.

>     “(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin’s bullet on April 15, 1865.

>     “(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln’s life is a model for accomplishing the ‘American dream’ through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.

>     “(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.

>     “(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.

>     “(9) The so-called ‘Lincoln cent’ was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln’s birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation’s coinage.

>     “(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.

>     “(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ‘Lincoln cent’, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

>     “(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln’s birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln’s life.
