    In the section, the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” for consistency.

    In subsection (a), the word “agency” is substituted for “departments and establishments” because of section 701 of the revised title.

    In subsection (b), the word “record” is substituted for “books, rec­ords, papers, or documents” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
