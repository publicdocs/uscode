In the section, before clause (1), the first sentence is substituted for 31:52–3(l)(1)(1st sentence) for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The word “review” is substituted for “appeal” for consistency. The words “the procedures of”, “any other provision of law”, “of a final decision of the Board . . . the date . . . of the Board”, and “In any case filed under paragraph (1) . . . review the record and” are omitted as surplus. The words “final decision” are substituted for “agency action, findings, or conclusions” for consistency. Clause (2) is substituted for 31:52–3(l)(2)(B) to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __1984__  __Act__ 

    This clarifies section 755 by conforming it more closely to the language of the source provision of the section.
