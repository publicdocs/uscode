    In the section, the words “sell, exchange” are omitted as being included in “dispose”. The word “obligations” is substituted for “bonds, notes, or other securities” for consistency in the revised title. The words “under judicial process or otherwise” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 302 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s302]” are omitted as unnecessary and because section 302 was repealed by [section 1(95) of the Act of October 31, 1951][/us/act/1951-10-31/s1/95] (ch. 654, [65 Stat. 705][/us/stat/65/705]). In clause (2), the words “those obligations” are substituted for “thereof” for clarity.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Secretary may dispose or extend the maturity of obligations under subsection (a) of this section” are added for clarity and because of the restatement. The words “combination of cash, obligations, or property” are substituted for “or any combination thereof” for clarity. The words “terms and conditions” are omitted as being included in “on conditions”. The words “under the authority of this section” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.

    Subsection (c) is substituted for 31:741a(b) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 98–369][/us/pl/98/369] struck out provision that the Secretary could not dispose of obligations of one issuer, held by the Secretary at one time, having on the date of disposal a total face or par value of more than $1,000,000 or, if no-par obligations, a stated or book value of more than $1,000,000.
