    In the section, the words “When the term of office . . . ends” are substituted for “whose terms of office have expired or shall expire” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “may continue to serve” are substituted for “The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay”, “and who have been performing or shall perform the duties of their respective offices after the date of such expiration”, and “the salary, compensation, fees, or emoluments authorized or provided by law in each case for the respective incumbents of the offices” because of 25 Op. Atty. Gen. 636 (1906) and for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words “until a successor is appointed and qualified” are substituted for “before the appointment and qualification of their successors” and 31:1016 (last sentence) for consistency with other titles of the Code.
