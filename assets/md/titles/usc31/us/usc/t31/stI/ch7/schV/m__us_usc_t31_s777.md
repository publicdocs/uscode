    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the text of 31:43c(a)(words before colon) is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), the words “in any year” and “commencing” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “per centum” and “by the Comptroller General” are omitted as surplus. The words “Civil Service Commission” (subsequently changed to “Office of Personnel Management” because of section 101 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 (eff. Jan. 1, 1979, [92 Stat. 3783][/us/stat/92/3783])) are omitted because of the restatement of [section 8340(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8340/b] by section 1702(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “by reason of the application of subsection (a) of this section” and “annual” are omitted as surplus. The words “basic pay” are substituted for “compensation” for consistency with other titles of the United States Code.
