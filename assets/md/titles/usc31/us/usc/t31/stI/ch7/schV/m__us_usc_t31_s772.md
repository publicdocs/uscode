## § 772. Annuity of the Comptroller General

    (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a Comptroller General serving a complete term as Comptroller General or who retires under [section 703(e)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s703/e/1] is entitled to receive an annuity for life equal to the pay the Comptroller General is receiving on completion of the term or at the time of retirement. An annuity of a Comptroller General who completes a term before becoming 65 years of age is reduced by .25 percent for each complete month the Comptroller General is under 65 years of age.

    (b)

     Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a Comptroller General becoming permanently disabled shall be retired and is entitled to receive an annuity for life equal to—

        (1) the pay of the Comptroller General at the time of retirement if the Comptroller General served at least 10 years; or

        (2) 50 percent of the pay if the Comptroller General served less than 10 years.

    (c) A Comptroller General who, when appointed, is or has been subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5 remains subject to such subchapter III or such chapter 84 (as the case may be) unless the Comptroller General elects in writing to receive an annuity under this section. An election is irrevocable and must be made within 10 years and 60 days after the start of service as Comptroller General. A Comptroller General electing to receive an annuity under this section is entitled to a refund of the lump-sum credit to the account of the Comptroller General in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

    (d)

     A Comptroller General (except a Comptroller General remaining subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5) shall—

        (1)

         deposit with the Government Accountability Office for redeposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts as a contribution to the annuity—

            (A) 3.5 percent of the pay received as Comptroller General before deductions are made under clause (2)(A) of this subsection plus 3 percent interest compounded every December 31 on the amount to be deposited, if electing survivor benefits under this subchapter; or

            (B) 8 percent of the pay received as Comptroller General before deductions are made under clause (2)(B) of this subsection plus 3 percent interest compounded every December 31 on the amount to be deposited, if not electing survivor benefits under this subchapter; and

        (2)

         have—

            (A) 3.5 percent of the pay received as Comptroller General deducted as a contribution to the annuity if electing survivor benefits under this subchapter; or

            (B) 8 percent of the pay received as Comptroller General deducted as a contribution to the annuity if not electing survivor benefits under this subchapter.

    (e) A Comptroller General receiving benefits under this section may not receive retirement or disability benefits under another law of the United States.
