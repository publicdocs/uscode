    Subsection (a) restates the source provisions because of section 701 of the revised title and for consistency with section 101 of the revised title.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the word “evaluate” is substituted for “review and evaluate” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (3), the words “a committee of Congress” are substituted for “any committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or any joint committee of the two Houses” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), the word “evaluate” is substituted for “review and evaluation” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (d)(1), before clause (A), the words “committee of Congress” are substituted for “committee of either House or any joint committee of the two Houses” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (A), the words “objectives and”, “actual”, and “but are not limited to” are omitted as surplus. In clause (B), the words “analyzing and” and “or evaluation studies” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (d)(2), the word “Congress” is substituted for “either House” for clarity. The words “statement or other” are omitted as surplus.
