    In subsection (a), the words “instrumentality of the United States Government” are substituted for “establishment of the Government” for consistency. The words “created . . . to be” and 31:41(2d, 3d sentences) are omitted as executed.

Subsection (b) is substituted for 31:41(1st sentence last 14 words) and 42(a)(1st sentence words before comma) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency. The word “Deputy” is substituted for “Assistant” because of [section 101 of the Act of July 9, 1971][/us/act/1971-07-09/s101] ([Pub. L. 92–51][/us/pl/92/51], [85 Stat. 143][/us/stat/85/143]). The text of 31:1154(d)(1st sentence) and 1155(a) is omitted as unnecessary because the Comptroller General, as the head of the Office, has the authority to establish constituent parts of the Office to carry out duties and powers unless otherwise specified by law.

    In subsection (c), the words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “the head of any Federal agency which exercises authority over such building” for clarity. The words “of the United States” are omitted as surplus.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–271][/us/pl/108/271] substituted “Government Accountability Office” for “General Accounting Office” in section catchline and subsec. (a).

    1988—Subsecs. (c), (d). [Pub. L. 100–545][/us/pl/100/545] redesignated subsec. (d) as (c) and struck out former subsec. (c) which directed Administrator of General Services to provide Comptroller General with space in General Accounting Office Building.
