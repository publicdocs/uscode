    The words “By February 3, 1984” are substituted for “at least one year prior to the expiration of this chapter” for clarity and to reflect the 5-year extension granted the joint funding simplification program by the Act of December 16, 1980 ([Pub. L. 96–534][/us/pl/96/534], [94 Stat. 3164][/us/stat/94/3164]). The word “comprehensive” is omitted as unnecessary. The word “amendment” is substituted for “modification” for clarity. The word “include” is substituted for “provide”, and the word “operation” is substituted for “functioning”, for consistency in the chapter.
