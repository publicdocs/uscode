## § 6704. State area allocations; allocations and payments to territorial governments

    (a)  __Formula Allocation by State__  __.—__ 

    For each payment period, the Secretary shall allocate to each State out of the amount appropriated for the period under the authority of section 6702(b) (minus the amounts allocated to territorial governments under subsection (e) for the payment period) an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount appropriated (minus such amounts allocated under subsection (e)) as the amount allocated to the State under this section bears to the total amount allocated to all States under this section. The Secretary shall—

        (1) determine the amount allocated to the State under subsection (b) or (c) of this section and allocate the larger amount to the State; and

        (2) allocate the amount allocated to the State to units of general local government in the State under sections 6705 and 6706.

    (b) __General Formula.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the amount allocated to a State under this subsection for a payment period is the amount bearing the same ratio to $5,300,000,000 as—

            (A) the population of the State, multiplied by the general tax effort factor of the State (determined under paragraph (2)), multiplied by the relative income factor of the State (determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by the relative rate of the labor force unemployed in the State (determined under paragraph (4)); bears to

            (B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for all States.

        (2)  __General tax effort factor__  __.—__ 

        The general tax effort factor of a State for a payment period is—

            (A) the net amount of State and local taxes of the State collected during the year 1991 as reported by the Bureau of the Census in the publication Government Finances 1990–1991; divided by

            (B) the total income of individuals, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce for national accounts purposes for 1992 as reported in the publication Survey of Current Business (August 1993), attributed to the State for the same year.

        (3)  __Relative income factor__  __.—__ 

        The relative income factor of a State is a fraction in which—

            (A) the numerator is the per capita income of the United States; and

            (B) the denominator is the per capita income of the State.

        (4)  __Relative rate of labor force__  __.—__ 

        The relative rate of the labor force unemployed in a State is a fraction in which—

            (A) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and

            (B) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes).

    (c)  __Alternative Formula__  __.—__ 

    For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the amount allocated to a State under this subsection for a payment period is the total amount the State would receive if—

        (1) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the population of the State bears to the population of all States;

        (2)

         $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population inversely weighted for per capita income, by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as—

            (A)

             the population of the State, multiplied by a fraction in which—

                (i) the numerator is the per capita income of all States; and

                (ii) the denominator is the per capita income of the State; bears to

            (B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) for all States;

        (3) $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of income tax collections by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the income tax amount of the State (determined under subsection (d)(1)) bears to the sum of the income tax amounts of all States;

        (4) $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of general tax effort by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the general tax effort amount of the State (determined under subsection (d)(2)) bears to the sum of the general tax effort amounts of all States;

        (5)

         $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of unemployment by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as—

            (A)

             the labor force of the State, multiplied by a fraction in which—

                (i) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and

                (ii) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes)

                bears to

            (B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) for all States; and

        (6) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of urbanized population by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the urbanized population of the State bears to the urbanized population of all States. In this paragraph, the term “urbanized population” means the population of an area consisting of a central city or cities of at least 50,000 inhabitants and the surrounding closely settled area for the city or cities considered as an urbanized area as published by the Bureau of the Census for 1990 in the publication General Population Characteristics for Urbanized Areas.

    (d) __Income Tax Amount and Tax Effort Amount.—__ 

        (1)  __Income tax amount__  __.—__ 

        The income tax amount of a State for a payment period is 15 percent of the net amount collected during the calendar year ending before the beginning of the payment period from the tax imposed on the income of individuals by the State and described as a State income tax under section 164(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ([26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3)][/us/usc/t26/s164/a/3]). The income tax amount for a payment period shall be at least 1 percent but not more than 6 percent of the United States Government individual income tax liability attributed to the State for the taxable year ending during the last calendar year ending before the beginning of the payment period. The Secretary shall determine the Government income tax liability attributed to the State by using the data published by the Secretary for 1991 in the publication Statistics of Income Bulletin (Winter 1993–1994).

        (2)  __General tax effort amount__  __.—__ 

        The general tax effort amount of a State for a payment period is the amount determined by multiplying—

            (A) the net amount of State and local taxes of the State collected during the year 1991 as reported in the Bureau of  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “of the”. </sup></sup>  Census in the publication Government Finances 1990–1991; and

            (B) the general tax effort factor of the State determined under subsection (b)(2).

    (e) __Allocation for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            (A) For each payment period for which funds are available for allocation under this chapter, the Secretary shall allocate to each territorial government an amount equal to the product of 1 percent of the amount of funds available for allocation multiplied by the applicable territorial percentage.

            (B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the applicable territorial percentage of a territory is equal to the quotient resulting from the division of the territorial population of such territory by the sum of the territorial population for all territories.

        (2)  __Payments to local governments__  __.—__ 

        The governments of the territories shall make payments to local governments within their jurisdiction from sums received under this subsection as they consider appropriate.

        (3)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) the term “territorial government” means the government of a territory;

            (B) the term “territory” means Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands; and

            (C) the term “territorial population” means the most recent population for each territory as determined by the Bureau of 1 Census.
