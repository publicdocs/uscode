    In the chapter, the words “chief executive officer” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In the section, before clause (1), the words “It is the purpose of this chapter” are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “each State which receives block grant funds under this Act shall comply with the requirements of this chapter, to the extent that such funds may be used at the discretion of the State, as described in subsection (b)(1)(B)” are omitted as surplus and because of the restatement of the source provisions in section 7302 of the revised title. In clause (2), the words “urban and rural” are omitted as surplus.
