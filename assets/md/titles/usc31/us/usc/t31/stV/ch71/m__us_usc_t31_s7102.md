In clause (1), the words “applying for” are substituted for “seeking” for clarity. The words “acting separately or together” are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 42:4261(4) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 102 of the revised title.

    In clause (2), the words “of the United States Government” are added for clarity. The words “assistance in the form of” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In clause (3), the words “a county, city, political subdivision of a county or city, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State” are substituted for “a local unit of government including a city, county, parish, town, township, village,” for consistency in the revised title and because of 1:2. The word “agency” is omitted because it is included in “instrumentality”.

    In clause (4), the words “that contribute” are substituted for “if each of those components” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “whether of a temporary or continuing nature” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In clause (5), the words “any of the several” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” are omitted as being included in “territory or possession of the United States” and as unnecessary because of 48:734.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Par. (3). [Pub. L. 103–272][/us/pl/103/272] substituted “political” for “politicial” after “other general purpose”.
