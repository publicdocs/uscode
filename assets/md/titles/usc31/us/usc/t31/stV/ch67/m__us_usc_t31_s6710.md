        (2)  __Senior citizens__  __.—__ 

        A unit of general local government holding a hearing required under this subsection or by the budget process of the government shall try to provide senior citizens and senior citizen organizations with an opportunity to present views at the hearing before the government makes a final decision on the use of the payment.

    (b) __Disclosure of Information.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        By the 10th day before a hearing required under subsection (a)(1) is held, a unit of general local government shall—

            (B) publish in at least one newspaper of general circulation the proposed use of the payment with the summary of the proposed budget and a notice of the time and place of the hearing.

        (2)  __Availability__  __.—__ 

        By the 30th day after adoption of the budget under State or local law, the government shall—

    (c)  __Waivers of Requirements__  __.—__ 

    A requirement—

            (B) includes a hearing on the proposed use of a payment received under this chapter in relation to the entire budget of the government; and

        (2) under subsection (b)(1)(B) and paragraph (2)(B) may be waived if the cost of publishing the information would be unreasonably burdensome in relation to the amount allocated to the government from amounts available for payment under this chapter, or if publication is otherwise impracticable.
