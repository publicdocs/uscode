## § 3125. Relief for lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced obligations

    (a) In this section, “obligation” means a direct obligation of the United States Government issued under law for valuable consideration, including bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills, and interim certificates issued for an obligation.

    (b) The Secretary of the Treasury may provide relief for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of an obligation identified by number and description.

    (c)

        (1) An indemnity bond is required as a condition of relief if the obligation is payable to bearer or assigned so as to become payable to bearer and is not proven clearly to have been destroyed. The Secretary may prescribe for the indemnity bond the form, amount, and surety or security requirements.

        (2) Relief for interest coupons claimed to have been attached to an obligation may be provided only if the Secretary is satisfied that the coupons have not been paid and are destroyed or will not become the basis of a valid claim against the Government.

    In the section, the word “obligation” is substituted for “security” in the defined term for consistency in the chapter and the revised title and to eliminate using the word “security” in 2 different ways in the same section.

    In subsection (b), the words “Under such regulations as he may deem necessary for the administration of this section” are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321(b) of the revised title.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “whether before, at, or after maturity” and “in effect” are omitted as surplus.
