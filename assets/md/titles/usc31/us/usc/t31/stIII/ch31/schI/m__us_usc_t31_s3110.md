## § 3110. Sale of obligations of governments of foreign countries

    (a)

     With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may sell obligations of the government of a foreign country when the obligations were acquired under—

        (1) the First Liberty Bond Act and matured before June 16, 1947;

        (2) the Second Liberty Bond Act and matured before October 16, 1938; or

        (3) section 7(a) of the Victory Liberty Loan Act.

    (b) The Secretary may prescribe the conditions and frequency for receiving payment under obligations of a government of a foreign country acquired under the laws referred to in subsection (a) of this section. A sale of an obligation acquired under those Acts shall at least equal the purchase price and accrued interest. The proceeds of obligations sold under this section and payments received from governments on the principal of their obligations shall be used to redeem or buy (for not more than par value and accrued interest) bonds of the United States Government issued under this chapter. If those bonds cannot be redeemed or bought, the Secretary shall redeem or buy other outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the Government that are subject to redemption or which can be bought at not more than par value and accrued interest.

    In the section, the words “government of a foreign country” are substituted for “foreign governments” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a), the text of 31:801 and 802 (related to converting certain obligations of foreign governments into obligations bearing a higher rate of interest or with a longer term to maturity) is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (b), the text of 31:804 is omitted as unnecessary. The word “conditions” is substituted for “terms and conditions” because it is inclusive. The words “unless otherwise hereafter provided by law” are omitted as surplus.
