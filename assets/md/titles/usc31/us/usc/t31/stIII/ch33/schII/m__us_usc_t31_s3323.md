    In the section, the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” for consistency.

    Subsection (a) is substituted for 31:76(2d sentence words before 3d comma) and 147(related to disbursement) to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (b), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “Treasurer” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title.

    In subsection (b)(1), the words “instead of being specified on the warrant” are omitted as surplus. The reference to “[section 3526 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3526]” is used because section 72, referred to in 31:76, has been omitted from the restatement superseded by 31:82i and 31:82i is restated in section 3526.

    In subsection (c), the word “depositing” is substituted for “covering” for clarity and consistency.
