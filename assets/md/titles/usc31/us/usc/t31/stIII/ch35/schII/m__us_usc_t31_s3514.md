## § 3514. Discontinuing certain accounts maintained by the Comptroller General

    The Comptroller General may discontinue an agency appropriation, expenditure, limitation, receipt, or personal ledger account maintained by the Comptroller General when the Comptroller General believes that the accounting system and internal controls of the agency will allow the Comptroller General to carry out the functions related to the account.

    The words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” for consistency. The word “agency” is substituted for “executive, legislative, and judicial agencies” because of sections 101, 102, and 3501 of the revised title. The word “properly” is omitted as surplus.
