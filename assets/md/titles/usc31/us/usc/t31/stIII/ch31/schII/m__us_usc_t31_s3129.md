## § 3129. Appropriation to pay expenses

    (a)

     Amounts to pay necessary expenses (including rent) for an issue of obligations authorized under this chapter are appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury. However, the amount appropriated under this section may not be more than—

        (1) .2 percent of the amount of bonds and notes authorized under this chapter;

        (2) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of indebtedness authorized under [section 3104 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3104]; and

        (3) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of indebtedness authorized under the First Liberty Bond Act.

    (b) An appropriation under this section is available for obligation only through the end of the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the issue was made. During a period for which an appropriation for a specified amount is made for expenses for which this section makes an appropriation for an unspecified amount, only the appropriation for the specified amount is available for obligation.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “an issue of obligations authorized under this chapter” are substituted for 31:761(less proviso) to reflect consolidation of the authority for issues of obligations in the revised chapter and for consistency. The text of 31:757c(e) is omitted as unnecessary and superseded by 39:410. The words “out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated” in 31:760 are omitted as unnecessary and for consistency. The words “to be expended as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct” in 31:760 are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the .2 percent limitation on expenses of bonds referred to in 31:760 is made applicable to a “note” because of the definition of bond in 31:753(d)(last sentence). The words “sections 735 to 738, . . . 765, . . . 773 of this title and [section 84 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s84]” in 31:753(d)(last sentence) are omitted because they refer to sections previously repealed (31:735–738, 765) or obsolete (31:773, which was superseded by 39:410) and because 12:84 was amended to express the result required by the source provisions by [section 10 of the Act of February 25, 1927][/us/act/1927-02-25/s10] (ch. 191, [44 Stat. 1229][/us/stat/44/1229]).

    In subsection (b), the words “appropriation for the specified amount” are substituted for “definite appropriation”, and the words “appropriation for an unspecified amount” are substituted for “indefinite appropriation”, as being more precise. The word “only” is substituted for “and the indefinite appropriation shall not be available for obligation” to eliminate unnecessary words.
