## § 3907. Relationship to other laws

    (a) A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this chapter may be filed under [section 7103 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s7103].

    (b)

        (1)

         An interest penalty under this chapter does not continue to accrue—

            (A) after a claim for a penalty is filed under chapter 71 of title 41; or

            (B) for more than one year.

        (2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not prevent an interest penalty from accruing under section 7109(a)(1) and (b) of title 41 after a penalty stops accruing under this chapter. A penalty accruing under section 7109(a)(1) and (b) may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this chapter.

    (c) Except as provided in [section 3904 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3904], this chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract. A claim related to the dispute, and interest payable for the period during which the dispute is being resolved, is subject to chapter 71 of title 41.
