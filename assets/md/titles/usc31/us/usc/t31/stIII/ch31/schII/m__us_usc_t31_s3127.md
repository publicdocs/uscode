## § 3127. Credit to officers, employees, and agents for stolen Treasury notes

    When an officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government authorized to receive, redeem, or cancel Treasury notes receives or pays a note that was stolen and put in circulation after it had been received or redeemed by an officer, employee, or agent authorized to receive or redeem the note, the Secretary of the Treasury may allow the officer, employee, or agent receiving or paying the stolen note a credit for the amount of the note. The Secretary may allow the credit only if the Secretary is satisfied that the note was received or paid in good faith and in exercising ordinary prudence.

    The word “employee” is added for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words “of the United States Government” are added for clarity and consistency. The word “duly” is omitted as surplus. The words “issued by authority of law” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “which has subsequently thereto” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “is satisfied” are substituted for “upon full and satisfactory proof” to eliminate unnecessary words.
