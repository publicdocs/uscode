            (B) in the case of a filing of a paper at the Government Accountability Office or a Federal agency, such last day is a day on which weather or other conditions cause the closing of the Government Accountability Office or Federal agency, in which event the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday shall be included.

        (2) __Imposition of fees.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            The Comptroller General may require each person who files a protest under this subchapter to pay a fee to support the establishment and operation of the electronic system under this subsection, without regard to whether or not the person uses the system with respect to the protest.

            (B)  __Amount__  __.—__ 

            The Comptroller General shall establish (and from time to time shall update) a schedule setting forth the amount of the fee to be paid under subparagraph (A).

        (3) __Treatment of amounts collected.—__ 

            (A)  __Establishment of account__  __.—__ 

            The Comptroller General shall maintain a separate account among the accounts of the Government Accountability Office for the electronic system under this subsection, and shall deposit all amounts received as fees under paragraph (2) into the account.

            (B)  __Use of amounts__  __.—__ 

            Amounts in the account maintained under this paragraph shall be available to the Comptroller General, without fiscal year limitation, solely to establish and operate the electronic system under this subsection.
