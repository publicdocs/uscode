    In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasurer” before “is not liable” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word “depositary” is substituted for “upon the Treasurer of the United States through any Federal Reserve Bank” for consistency in the revised title. The words “Whenever . . . heretofore has been or hereafter” and “or on behalf of” are omitted as surplus. In clause (A), the word “Treasury” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” after “drawn upon the” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title and Department of the Treasury Order 229 of January 14, 1974 (39 F.R. 2280). In clause (B), the words “public . . . of the United States, including any obligation of any type whatever, the payment of which is” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “of the Treasury or the depositary” are substituted for “Treasurer’s” because of the restatement.

    In subsection (b), the words “another individual” are substituted for “any person, other than the Treasurer of the United States” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “now existing or which may hereafter exist” are omitted as unnecessary.
