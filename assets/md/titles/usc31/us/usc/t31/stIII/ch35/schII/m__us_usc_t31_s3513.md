    In subsection (a), the words “the results of” are omitted as surplus. The words “The report” are substituted for “Provided, That” for clarity. The word “information” is substituted for “data” for consistency. The word “President” is substituted for “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, [84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]) redesignated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President. The words “in connection with the preparation of the Budget or for other purposes of the Office” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “The head of” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “by rules and regulations” are omitted as unnecessary because of [section 321(b) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s321/b]. The words “to prepare the reports” are substituted for “for the effective performance of his responsibilities under this section” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

In subsection (b)(2), the words “install, revise, or eliminate”, “the several bureaus and offices of”, “with such concentration of accounting and reporting as is necessary”, and “the activities of” are omitted as surplus. The word “be” is substituted for “provide” for clarity. The text of 31:66b(b)(last sentence) is omitted as unnecessary because of [section 321 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s321].

    In subsection (c), before clause (1), the text of 31:66b(c) is omitted as unnecessary. The words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” for consistency. In clause (1), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “Treasury Department” in 31:66(b)(related to Treasury Department) for consistency. The word “central” is omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the word “considers” is substituted for “deemed” as being more precise. The words “under [section 3511 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3511]” are substituted for “by him” for clarity.
