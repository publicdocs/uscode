    In the section, before clause (1), the words “except as provided in [section 523 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s523]” are omitted as superseded by title 39. The words “of the United States, to the credit of the Treasurer” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the words “if the Secretary believes the safety of the public money and convenience require it” are substituted for “as the safety of the public moneys and the convenience of the public service shall seem to him to require” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
