The agency head may comment on the inspector general’s statement, but may not modify the statement.

    (e) A report under subsection (a) shall include a transmittal letter from the agency head containing, in addition to any other content, an assessment by the agency head of the completeness and reliability of the performance and financial data used in the report.
