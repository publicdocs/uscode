    In subsection (a), the words “public money” are substituted for “the moneys of the United States” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency. The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasurer” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. In clauses (3) and (4), the words “deposited in the Treasury” are substituted for “received by him” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. In clause (4), the words “signed by the Secretary of the Treasury” are omitted as surplus. In clauses (5) and (6), the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” for consistency. In clause (5), the word “submit” is substituted for “render” for consistency.
