## § 3715. Buying real property of a debtor

    The head of an agency for whom a civil action is brought against a debtor of the United States Government may buy real property of the debtor at a sale on execution of the real property of the debtor resulting from the action. The head of the agency may not bid more for the property than the amount of the judgment for which the property is being sold, and costs. The marshal of the district in which the sale is held shall transfer the property to the Government.

The words “for whom a civil action is brought” are substituted for “at whose instance suit was instituted” for consistency. The words “real property” are substituted for “lands or tenements” for clarity and consistency. The words “in behalf of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The words “for the property” are added for clarity. The word “property” is substituted for “such estate” for consistency in the section.
