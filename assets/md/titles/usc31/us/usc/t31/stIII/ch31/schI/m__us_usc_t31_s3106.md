## § 3106. Retirement and savings bonds

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue retirement and savings bonds of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under [section 3111 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3111]. The proceeds from the bonds shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Retirement and savings bonds may be issued only on a discount basis. The maturity period of the bonds shall be at least 10 years from the date of issue but not more than 30 years from the date of issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount received on redeeming a bond is interest under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ([26 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t26/s1] et seq.).

    (b) With the approval of the President, the Secretary may allow owners of retirement and savings bonds to keep the bonds after maturity and continue to earn interest on them at rates that are consistent with the rate of investment yield provided by retirement and savings bonds.

    (c) Section 3105(c)(1)–(5) of this title applies to this section. Sections 3105(c)(6) and (d) and 3126 of this title apply to this section to the extent consistent with this section. The Secretary may prescribe the maximum amount of retirement and savings bonds issued under this section in a year that may be held by one person. However, the maximum amount shall be at least $3,000.

    In subsection (a), the words “In addition to the United States savings bonds authorized to be issued under [section 757c of this title][/us/usc/t31/s757c]” are omitted as surplus. The words “through the United States Postal Service or otherwise” are omitted as surplus and unnecessary because of 39:411. The words “and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under [section 3111 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s3111]” are added because of the restatement. The words “and to retire any outstanding obligations of the United States bearing interest or issued on a discount basis” are omitted as unnecessary because of section 3111 of the revised title. The words “as the terms thereof may provide” are omitted because of the restatement.

    In subsection (b), the word “conditions” is substituted for “terms” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “by regulations” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “at their option” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the words “Section 3105(c)(1)–(5) of this title applies to this section” are substituted for 31:757c–2(a)(last sentence) and (b)(1)(2d sentence words before 1st comma, 3d sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “by regulations” are omitted as unnecessary.
