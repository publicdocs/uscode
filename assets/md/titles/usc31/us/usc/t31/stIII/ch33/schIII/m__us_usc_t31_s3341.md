    In subsection (a), the words “disbursing official” are substituted for “officer” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words “either directly or indirectly” and “or dispose of to any person” are omitted as surplus. The words “Government warrant, check, draft, or obligation” are substituted for “Treasury note, draft, warrant, or other public security” for consistency in the revised title. The words “or sell . . . avails or . . . in his hands for disbursement” are omitted as surplus. The words “only if the official deposits the premium and the proceeds in the Treasury or with a depositary” are substituted for “without making return of such premium, and accounting therefor by charging the same in his account” for clarity and consistency in the chapter.

    In subsection (b), the words “from office” are omitted as unnecessary.
