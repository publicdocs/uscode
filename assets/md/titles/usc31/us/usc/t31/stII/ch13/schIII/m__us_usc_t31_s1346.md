    In the section, the words “executive agency” are substituted for “any executive department or other Government establishment” for clarity and because of section 102 of the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(1), before subclause (A), the words “made by Congress” are omitted as surplus. In subclause (C), the words “the detail or cost of personal services of an officer” are substituted for “by detail, hereafter or heretofore made, or otherwise personal services” to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “of the Government” are omitted as surplus. The words “absent a special appropriation” are substituted for “until special appropriations shall have been made by law” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “On or after May 3, 1945” are omitted as executed. The words “interagency group” are substituted for “committees, boards, or other interagency groups” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “includes a representative of the agency” are substituted for “composed in whole or in part of representatives thereof” for clarity.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “authorized by law” are substituted for “unless the creation . . . shall be or shall have been authorized by law” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “armed forces” are substituted for “military or naval service of the United States” for consistency.

    Subsection (c)(3) is substituted for the last sentence of 31:672 to eliminate unnecessary words.
