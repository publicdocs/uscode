## § 1109. Current programs and activities estimates

    (a) On or before the first Monday after January 3 of each year (on or before February 5 in 1986), the President shall submit to both Houses of Congress the estimated budget outlays and proposed budget authority that would be included in the budget for the following fiscal year if programs and activities of the United States Government were carried on during that year at the same level as the current fiscal year without a change in policy. The President shall state the estimated budget outlays and proposed budget authority by function and subfunction under the classifications in the budget summary table under the heading “Budget Authority and Outlays by Function and Agency”, by major programs in each function, and by agency. The President also shall include a statement of the economic and program assumptions on which those budget outlays and budget authority are based, including inflation, real economic growth, and unemployment rates, program caseloads, and pay increases.

    (b) The Joint Economic Committee shall review the estimated budget outlays and proposed budget authority and submit an economic evaluation of the budget outlays and budget authority to the Committees on the Budget of both Houses before March 1 of each year.

    In the section, the words “budget outlays” are substituted for “outlays” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a), the words “Before November 11” are substituted for “On or before November 10”, the words “both Houses of Congress” are substituted for “the Senate and the House of Representatives”, the word “following” is substituted for “ensuing”, and the word “current” is substituted for “in progress”, for consistency. The words “(beginning with 1975)” are omitted as executed. The words “of the United States Government” are added for clarity. The words “in such programs and activities” are omitted as surplus. The words “The President shall state” are substituted for “shall be shown”, and the words “The President also shall include” are substituted for “Accompanying these estimates shall be”, because of the restatement.

    In subsection (b), the words “so submitted” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “before January 1” are substituted for “on or before December 31” for consistency.
