    The words “On and after April 27, 1937” are omitted as executed. The words “Charges for telephone and metered services” are substituted for “in making payments for commodities or services the quantity of which is determined by metered readings . . . and for telephone services” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “another fiscal year or allotment period” are substituted for “another”, and the words “time period covered by the service” are substituted for “such period”, for clarity.
