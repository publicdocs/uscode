    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “by warrant” are omitted as unnecessary because of chapter 33 of the revised title. The word “appropriation” is substituted for “moneys appropriated” for consistency in the revised title. The words “for a private organization” are substituted for “for the aid, use, support, or benefit of any charitable, industrial, or other association, institution, or corporation” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “official” is substituted for “officer” for consistency in the revised title. In clause (1), the word “Treasury” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title and Department of the Treasury Order 229 of January 14, 1974 (39 F.R. 2280). The words “or of an assistant treasurer” in [section 1 of the Act of June 23, 1874][/us/act/1874-06-23/s1], are omitted as superseded by section 1(1st par. under heading “Independent Treasury”) of the Act of May 29, 1920 (ch. 214, [41 Stat. 254][/us/stat/41/254]).

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “The fiscal official may pay an amount out of the appropriation” are substituted for “shall be paid out” for clarity. In clause (1), the words “for services, materials, or any other purpose” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the words “in writing” are omitted as surplus. The word “purpose” is substituted for “object or purpose” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsections (b)(2) and (c), the word “amount” is substituted for “the avails thereof” for clarity.

    In subsection (c)(1), before clause (A), the words “an amount of less than $20 out of the appropriation” are substituted for “payments are to be made under $20” for clarity. In clause (B), the words “in writing on the check” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (c)(2), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “Treasurer” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title.
