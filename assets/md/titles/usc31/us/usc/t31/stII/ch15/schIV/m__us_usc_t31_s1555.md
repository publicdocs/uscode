    In subsection (a), the words “indefinite period” are substituted for “not limited to a definite period of time” for consistency in the revised title. The words “consecutive fiscal years” are substituted for “full consecutive fiscal years” to eliminate an unnecessary word.

    In subsection (b), the words “or were heretofore withdrawn from the appropriation account by administrative action” are omitted as executed.

 __Amendments__ 

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–510][/us/pl/101/510] substituted “Closing of appropriation accounts available” for “Withdrawal of unobligated balances of appropriations” in section catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:

    “(a) An unobligated balance of an appropriation for an indefinite period shall be withdrawn in the way provided in [section 1552(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s1552/a/2] when the head of the agency concerned decides that the purposes for which the appropriation was made have been carried out or when no disbursement is made against the appropriation for 2 consecutive fiscal years.

    “(b) An amount of an appropriation withdrawn under this section may be restored to the applicable appropriation account to pay obligations and to settle accounts.”

 __Effective Date of 1990 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 101–510][/us/pl/101/510] applicable to any appropriation account the obligated balance of which, on Nov. 5, 1990, has not been transferred under [section 1552(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t31/s1552/a/1], as in effect Nov. 4, 1990, with transitional provisions, see [section 1405(b) of Pub.
