    In subsection (a), the words “head of the agency” are substituted for “agency concerned” for consistency. The word “President” is substituted for “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, [84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.

    “(1) The Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall estimate each year the effect on the Federal deficit of payments and adjustments made with respect to sections 1552 and 1553 of this title. Such estimate shall be made separately for accounts of each agency.

    “(2) The Director shall include in the annual report of the Director to the Committees on the Budget of the Senate and House of Representatives under paragraph (1) of section 202(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 a statement of the estimates made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection during the preceding year (including any revisions to estimates contained in earlier reports under such paragraph). The Director shall include in any report under paragraph (2) of that section any revisions to such estimates made since the most recent report under paragraph (1) of such section.”

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–510][/us/pl/101/510] substituted “Audit, control, and reporting” for “Review of appropriation accounts” in section catchline and amended text generally, substituting subsecs.

> “At the same time that the President submits to Congress the budget for each of fiscal years 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996 under [section 1105 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105], United States Code, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall submit to Congress a report regarding the effect on the Federal deficit of payments and adjustments made with respect to sections 1552 and 1553 of such title for the fiscal year in which such budget is submitted, the fiscal year preceding that fiscal year, and the fiscal year covered by that budget.
