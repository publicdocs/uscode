    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Before July 16” are substituted for “on or before July 15” for consistency. The words “budget for the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted” are substituted for “Budget for the ensuing fiscal year transmitted to the Congress by the President” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter. The words “in such form and detail as he may determine” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (1)(D), the words “in summary form” and “summary of” are omitted as unnecessary. The word “necessary” is omitted as being included in “advisable”. In clauses (2) and (3), the word “information” is substituted for “summaries” because of the restatement. In clause (2), the words “programs authorized to continue in future years, or that are considered mandatory, under law” are substituted for “continuing programs which have a legal commitment for future years or are considered mandatory under existing law” for consistency.

    In subsection (b), the words “Before April 11 and July 16” are substituted for “on or before April 10 and July 15”, the word “changes” is substituted for “all amendments to or revisions in”, and the words “budget outlays” are substituted for “outlays”, the words “fiscal year for which the budget is submitted” are substituted for “ensuing fiscal year set forth in the Budget transmitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section”, for consistency. The word “information” is substituted for “summary data” because of the restatement.
