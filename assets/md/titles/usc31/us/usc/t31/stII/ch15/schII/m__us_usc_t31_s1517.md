    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “District of Columbia government” are added because of [section 9 of the Act of June 26, 1912][/us/act/1912-06-26/s9] (ch. 182, [37 Stat. 184][/us/stat/37/184]). In clause (1), the word “apportionment” is substituted for “apportionment or reapportionment” because of section 1512(a)(last sentence) of the revised title.

    In subsection (b), the word “Mayor” is used because of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Aug. 11, 1967, [81 Stat. 948][/us/stat/81/948]) and sections 421, 422, and 771 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act ([Pub. L. 93–198][/us/pl/93/198], [87 Stat. 789][/us/stat/87/789], 818). The word “President” is substituted for “President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, [84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447] inserted at end “A copy of each report shall also be transmitted to the Comptroller General on the same date the report is transmitted to the President and Congress.”
