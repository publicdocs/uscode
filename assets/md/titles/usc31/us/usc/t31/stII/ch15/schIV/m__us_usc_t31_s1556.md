    In the section, the word “President” is substituted for “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, [84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.

 __Amendments__ 

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–510][/us/pl/101/510] substituted “General: reports” for “General reports” in section catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:

    “(a) In carrying out audit responsibilities, the Comptroller General shall report on operations under this subchapter to—

    “(1) the head of the agency concerned;

    “(2) the Secretary of the Treasury; and

    “(3) the President.

    “(b) A report under this section shall include an appraisal of unpaid obligations under appropriation accounts established under [section 1552 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s1552]. By the 30th day after receiving a report, the head of the agency concerned shall carry out actions required by [section 1554 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s1554] that the report shows is necessary.”

 __Effective Date of 1990 Amendment__

L. 101–510][/us/pl/101/510/s1405/b], set out as a note under [section 1551 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s1551].
