## § 1534. Adjustments between appropriations

    (a)

     An appropriation available to an agency may be charged at any time during a fiscal year for the benefit of another appropriation available to the agency to pay costs—

        (1) when amounts are available in both the appropriation to be charged and the appropriation to be benefited; and

        (2) subject to limitations applicable to the appropriations.

    (b) Amounts paid under this section are charged on a final basis during, or as of the close of, the fiscal year to the appropriation benefited. The appropriation charged under subsection (a) of this section shall be appropriately credited.

([Pub. L. 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], Sept. 13, 1982, [96 Stat. 933][/us/stat/96/933].)

    In subsection (a), the words “Subject to limitations applicable with respect to each appropriation concerned” are omitted as surplus. The words “or any bureau or office thereof” are omitted as being included in “agency”. The words “to pay costs” are substituted for “for the purpose of financing the procurement of materials and services, or financing other costs” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “amounts paid under this section” are substituted for “such expenses so financed”, and the words “appropriations charged under subsection (a) of this section” are substituted for “financing appropriation”, for clarity.
