If the Secretary approves, a Federal reserve bank or a bank designated as a depositary or fiscal agent of the United States Government may keep the accounts. The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection.

        (1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to maintaining a temporary account of not more than $50,000 in one bank.

        (2) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to a mixed-ownership Government corporation when the corporation has no capital of the Government.

However, the head of each of those banks shall report each year to the Secretary the names of depositaries where accounts are kept. If the Secretary considers it advisable when an annual report is received, the Secretary may make a written report to the corporation, the President, and Congress.
