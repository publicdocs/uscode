## § 9308. Civil penalty

    A surety corporation is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of at least $500 but not more than $5,000 for violating section 9304, 9305, or 9306 of this title. A civil action under this section may be brought in a judicial district in which a civil action may be brought against the corporation under [section 9307 of this title][/us/usc/t31/s9307]. A penalty imposed under this section does not affect the validity of a contract made by the surety corporation.
