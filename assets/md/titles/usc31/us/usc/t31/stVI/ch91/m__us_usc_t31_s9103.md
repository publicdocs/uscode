    In subsection (a), the word “President” is substituted for “Office of Management and Budget” because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, [84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President. The words “in a way, and before a date, the President prescribes by regulation for the budget program” are substituted for “under such rules and regulations as the President may establish as to the date of submission, the form and content, the classifications of data, and the manner in which such budget program shall be prepared and presented” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “budget program” are substituted for “budget program shall be a business-type budget, or plan of operation” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “actual” and “completed” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “as are necessary or desirable”, “types of”, “together with”, and “funds” are omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words “as authorized by law” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the words “as changed” are substituted for “as modified, amended, or revised” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “submit” is substituted for “transmitted” for consistency. The word “annual” is omitted as surplus. The word “thereafter” is added for clarity. The text of 31:848 (last par.) is omitted as unnecessary.
