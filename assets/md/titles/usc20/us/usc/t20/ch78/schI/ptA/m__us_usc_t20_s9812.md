 __References in Text__ 

    Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, referred to in par. (4), was amended by [Pub. L. 114–95][/us/pl/114/95] and, as so amended, is now section 8101 of the Act and no longer defines “highly qualified”. A reference in this section to “highly qualified”, as defined in section 9101 of the Act, with respect to a teacher, means that the teacher meets applicable State certification and licensure requirements, including any requirements for certification obtained through alternative routes to certification. See [section 9214(a)(2) of Pub. L. 114–95][/us/pl/114/95/s9214/a/2], set out as a Use of the Term “Highly Qualified” in Other Laws note under [section 1070g–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070g–2].

    [Section 1401 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1401], referred to in par. (4), was amended by [Pub. L. 114–95, title IX][/us/pl/114/95/tIX], § 9214(d)(1), Dec. 10, 2015, [129 Stat. 2164][/us/stat/129/2164], and, as so amended, no longer contains a definition of the term “highly qualified”.
