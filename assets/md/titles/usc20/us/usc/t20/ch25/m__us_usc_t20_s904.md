        Subject to the regulations prescribed and issued by the Secretary of Defense under [section 902 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s902], each teacher (other than an individual employed as a substitute teacher) shall be entitled to cumulative leave, with pay, which shall accrue at the rate of one day for each calendar month, or part thereof, of a school year, except that if the school year includes more than eight months, any such teacher who shall have served for the entire school year shall be entitled to ten (or, if such teacher is employed in a supervisory position or higher, not less than ten and not more than thirteen) days of cumulative leave with pay.

    (b) __Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and nonwork days__ 

        Saturdays, Sundays, regularly scheduled holidays, and other administratively authorized nonwork days shall not be considered to be days of leave for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Purposes for taking leave__ 

    Subject to the regulations prescribed and issued by the Secretary of Defense, leave earned by any teacher under subsection (a) of this section may be used by such teacher—

        (1) for maternity purposes,

        (2) in the event of the illness of such teacher,

        (3) in the event of illness, contagious disease, or death in the immediate family of such teacher, and

        (4) in the event of any personal emergency.

        If appropriate advance notice is given of the intended absence of a teacher, not to exceed three days of such leave may be granted for any purpose in each school year to such teacher.

    (d) __Credit for persons holding teaching positions and for employees transferred, promoted or re­appointed__ 

    Any individual—

        (2) who is an employee of the Federal Government or the municipal government of the District of Columbia who is transferred, promoted, or reappointed, without break in service, from a position under a different leave system to a teaching position,

        shall be credited, for the purposes of the leave system provided by this section, with the annual and sick leave to his credit immediately prior to the effective date of such determination, transfer, promotion, or reappointment.

        Any annual leave remaining, upon his separation from the service, to the credit of an individual within the purview of this section shall be liquidated in accordance with [section 5551 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5551], except that leave earned or included under subsection (a) of this section shall not be liquidated.

    (g) __Transfer of leave credit for teachers transferred, promoted or reappointed to positions under different leave system__ 

        In the case of any teacher who is transferred, promoted, or reappointed, without break in service, to a position under a different leave system, the annual leave, and any other leave earned or credited under this section, which is to his credit immediately prior to such transfer, promotion, or reappointment, shall be transferred to his credit in the employing agency on an adjusted basis in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.

    (h) __Voluntary leave transfer and bank programs__
