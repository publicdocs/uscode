    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized by contract or otherwise to establish, equip, and operate day care center facilities for the purpose of serving children who are members of households of employees of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary is authorized to establish or provide for the establishment of appropriate fees and charges to be chargeable against the Department employees or others who are beneficiaries of services provided by such facilities to pay for the cost of their operation and to accept money, equipment, or other property donated for use in connection with the facilities. No appropriated funds may be used for the equipping or operation of any centers provided under this authority. The prohibition made by the preceding sentence shall not preclude the provision of appropriate donated space nor the purchase of the initial equipment for the centers, except that the cost of such equipment shall be reimbursed over the expected life of such equipment, not to exceed 10 years.
