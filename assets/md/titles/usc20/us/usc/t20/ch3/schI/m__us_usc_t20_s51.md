## § 51. Library

    The Regents shall make, from the interest of the fund, an appropriation, not exceeding an average of $25,000 annually, for the gradual formation of a library composed of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge.

(R.S. § 5587.)

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 5587 derived from [act Aug. 10, 1846, ch. 178, § 8][/us/act/1846-08-10/ch178/s8], [9 Stat. 105][/us/stat/9/105].

 __Public Use of Research and Study Facilities of Certain Institutions__ 

    Under provisions of R.S. § 94 and [act Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 179][/us/act/1875-03-03/ch179], [18 Stat. 512][/us/stat/18/512], the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress was authorized to extend the use of the Library to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. These provisions were not classified to the Code, being rendered superfluous by a general declaration of public policy by Congress, by a joint resolution adopted Apr. 12, 1892, [27 Stat. 395][/us/stat/27/395], to the effect that facilities for study and research in the Library of Congress, the National Museum, and similar institutions shall be afforded investigators, students, etc., in the several states and territories as well as in the District of Columbia.
