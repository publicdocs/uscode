        (3) obtain grants from, and make contracts with, State, Federal, local, and private agencies, organizations, institutions, and individuals;

        (4) acquire such site as a location for the Center as may subsequently be authorized by the Congress;

    (b) __Relocation assistance and programs__ 

        The Board shall, in connection with acquisition of any site authorized by Congress, as provided for in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this section, provide, to businesses and residents displaced from any such site, relocation assistance, including payments and other benefits, equivalent to that authorized to displace businesses and residents under the Housing Act of 1949, as amended \[[42 U.S.C. 1441][/us/usc/t42/s1441] et seq.\].
