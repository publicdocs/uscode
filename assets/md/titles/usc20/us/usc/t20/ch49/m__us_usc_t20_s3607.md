## § 3607. Recovery of costs by United States

    (a) __Suit by United States on behalf of grant or loan recipient for recovery of costs of activities of recipient; proceeds of judgment__ 

        (1) As a condition of the award of any grant under [section 3604 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3604] or loan under [section 3605 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3605], the recipient of any such grant or loan shall permit the United States to sue on behalf of such recipient any person determined by the Attorney General to be liable to the recipient for the costs of any activities undertaken by the recipient under such sections.

        (2)

         The proceeds from any judgment recovered in any suit brought by the United States under paragraph (1) (or, if the recipient files a similar suit on its own behalf, the proceeds from any judgment recovered by the recipient in such suit) shall be used to repay to the United States, to the extent that the proceeds are sufficient to provide for such repayment, an amount equal to the sum of—

            (A) the amount of any grant made to the recipient under [section 3604 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3604];

            (B) the amount outstanding on any loan made to the recipient under [section 3605 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3605]; and

            (C) an amount equal to the interest which would have been charged on such loan were the loan made by a commercial lender at prevailing interest rates (as determined by the Secretary).

    (b) __Investigation and report by Attorney General respecting feasibility of recovery of costs from any person determined by Attorney General to be liable__ 

        The Attorney General shall conduct an investigation to determine whether, by using all available means, the United States should or could recover, from any person determined by the Attorney General to be liable for such costs, the amounts expended by the United States to carry out this chapter. Within one year after June 14, 1980, the Attorney General shall submit to the Congress a report containing the results of the study, together with any appropriate recommendations.

    (c) __Expeditious proceedings by Attorney General__ 

        If the Attorney General determines in the report under subsection (b) of this section that the United States should seek to recover the amounts expended by the United States to carry out this chapter, the Attorney General shall proceed in an expeditious manner to recover such amounts from the persons referred to in subsection (b) of this section.
