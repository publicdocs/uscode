## § 10012. Fiscal relief

    (a) __In general__

    (b) __Duration__ 

        A waiver or modification under this section shall be for any of fiscal year 2009, fiscal year 2010, or fiscal year 2011, as determined by the Secretary.

    (c) __Criteria__ 

        The Secretary shall not grant a waiver or modification under this section unless the Secretary determines that the State receiving such waiver or modification will not provide for elementary, secondary, and public higher education, for the fiscal year under consideration, a smaller percentage of the total revenues available to the State than the percentage provided for such purpose in the preceding fiscal year.

    (d) __Maintenance of effort__ 

        Upon prior approval from the Secretary, a State or local educational agency that receives funds under this chapter may treat any portion of such funds that is used for elementary, secondary, or postsecondary education as non-Federal funds for the purpose of any requirement to maintain fiscal effort under any other program, including part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ([20 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t20/s1431] et seq.), administered by the Secretary.

    (e) __Subsequent level of effort__ 

        Notwithstanding (d), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “subsection (d),”. </sup></sup>  the level of effort required by a State or local educational agency for the following fiscal year shall not be reduced.
