    (a) __Reservations and State allotment__ 

        (1) __Reservations__ 

        From the sum appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall reserve—

            (A) 0.13 percent to carry out [section 2325 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2325]; and

            (B)

             1.50 percent to carry out [section 2326 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2326], of which—

                (i) 1.25 percent of the sum shall be available to carry out [section 2326(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2326/b]; and

                (ii) 0.25 percent of the sum shall be available to carry out [section 2326(h) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2326/h].

        (2) __State allotment formula__ 

        Subject to paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), from the remainder of the sum appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] and not reserved under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to a State for the fiscal year—

            (A) an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 15 to 19 inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;

            (B) an amount that bears the same ratio to 20 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 20 to 24, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;

            (C) an amount that bears the same ratio to 15 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 25 to 65, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States; and

            (D) an amount that bears the same ratio to 15 percent of the sum being allotted as the amounts allotted to the State under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) for such years bears to the sum of the amounts allotted to all the States under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) for such year.

        (3) __Minimum allotment for years with no additional funds__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), and paragraph (5), for a fiscal year for which there are no additional funds (as such term is defined in paragraph (4)(D)), no State shall receive for such fiscal year under this subsection less than ½ of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] and not reserved under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year. Amounts necessary for increasing such payments to States to comply with the preceding sentence shall be obtained by ratably reducing the amounts to be paid to other States.

            (B) __Requirement__ 

                No State, by reason of the application of subparagraph (A), shall receive for a fiscal year more than 150 percent of the amount the State received under this subsection for the preceding fiscal year.

            (C) __Special rule__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Subject to paragraph (5), no State, by reason of the application of subparagraph (A), shall be allotted for a fiscal year more than the lesser of—

                    (I) 150 percent of the amount that the State received in the preceding fiscal year; and

                    (II) the amount calculated under clause (ii).

                (ii) __Amount__ 

                The amount calculated under this clause shall be determined by multiplying—

                    (I) the number of individuals in the State counted under paragraph (2) in the preceding fiscal year; by

                    (II) 150 percent of the national average per pupil payment made with funds available under this section for that year.

        (4) __Minimum allotment for years with additional funds__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B) and paragraph (5), for a fiscal year for which there are additional funds, no State shall receive for such fiscal year under this subsection less than ½ of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] and not reserved under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year. Amounts necessary for increasing such payments to States to comply with the preceding sentence shall be obtained by ratably reducing the amounts to be paid to other States.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

            In the case of a qualifying State, the minimum allotment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year for the qualifying State shall be the lesser of—

                (i) ½ of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] and not reserved under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year; and

                (ii)

                 the sum of—

                    (II)

                     the product of—

                        (aa) ⅓ of the additional funds; multiplied by

                        (bb)

                         the quotient of—

                            (AA) the qualifying State’s ratio described in subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; divided by

                            (BB) the sum of all such ratios for all qualifying States for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

            (C) __Ratio__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii)(II)(bb)(AA), the ratio for a qualifying State for a fiscal year shall be 1.00 less the quotient of—

                (i) the amount the qualifying State was allotted under paragraph (2) for fiscal year 2006 (as such paragraph was in effect on the day before August 12, 2006); divided by

                (ii) ½ of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under [section 2307 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2307] and not reserved under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

        (5) __Hold harmless__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                No State shall receive an allotment under this section for a fiscal year that is less than the allotment the State received under part A of title I of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act ([20 U.S.C. 2311][/us/usc/t20/s2311] et seq.) (as such part was in effect on the day before October 31, 1998) for fiscal year 1998.

            (B) __Ratable reduction__ 

                If for any fiscal year the amount appropriated for allotments under this section is insufficient to satisfy the provisions of subparagraph (A), the payments to all States under such subparagraph shall be ratably reduced.

    (b) __Reallotment__ 

        If the Secretary determines that any amount of any State’s allotment under subsection (a) for any fiscal year will not be required for such fiscal year for carrying out the activities for which such amount has been allotted, the Secretary shall make such amount available for reallotment. Any such reallotment among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria established by regulation. No funds may be reallotted for any use other than the use for which the funds were appropriated. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year shall remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year and shall be deemed to be part of the State’s allotment for the year in which the amount is obligated.

    (c) __Allotment ratio__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The allotment ratio for any State shall be 1.00 less the product of—

            (A) 0.50; and

            (B)

             the quotient obtained by dividing the per capita income for the State by the per capita income for all the States (exclusive of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands), except that—

                (i) the allotment ratio in no case shall be more than 0.60 or less than 0.40; and

                (ii) the allotment ratio for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands shall be 0.60.

        (2) __Promulgation__ 

            The allotment ratios shall be promulgated by the Secretary for each fiscal year between October 1 and December 31 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made. Allotment ratios shall be computed on the basis of the average of the appropriate per capita incomes for the 3 most recent consecutive fiscal years for which satisfactory data are available.

        (3) __Definition of per capita income__ 

            For the purpose of this section, the term “per capita income” means, with respect to a fiscal year, the total personal income in the calendar year ending in such year, divided by the population of the area concerned in such year.

        (4) __Population determination__ 

            For the purposes of this section, population shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the latest estimates available to the Department of Education.

    (d) __Definition of State__
