        (2) __Formula__ 

            Each eligible institution or consortium of eligible institutions shall be allocated an amount that bears the same relationship to the portion of funds made available under [section 2322(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2322/a/1] to carry out this section for any fiscal year as the sum of the number of individuals who are Federal Pell Grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs enrolled in programs meeting the requirements of [section 2355 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s2355] offered by such institution or consortium in the preceding fiscal year bears to the sum of the number of such recipients enrolled in such programs within the State for such year.

        (3) __Consortium requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In order for a consortium of eligible institutions described in paragraph (2) to receive assistance pursuant to such paragraph, such consortium shall operate joint projects that—

                (i) provide services to all postsecondary institutions participating in the consortium; and

                (ii) are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to be effective.

            (B) __Funds to consortium__

    (c) __Minimum grant amount__
