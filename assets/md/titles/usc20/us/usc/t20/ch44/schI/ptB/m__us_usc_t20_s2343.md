            (A) __In general__ 

            The eligible agency may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, withhold from the eligible recipient all, or a portion, of the eligible recipient’s allotment under this subchapter if the eligible recipient—

            (B) __Waiver for exceptional circumstances__ 

            In determining whether to impose sanctions under subparagraph (A), the eligible agency may waive imposing sanctions—

                (i) due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the eligible recipient; or

                (ii) based on the impact on the eligible recipient’s reported performance of the small size of the career and technical education program operated by the eligible recipient.

        (5) __Funds resulting from reduced allotments__
