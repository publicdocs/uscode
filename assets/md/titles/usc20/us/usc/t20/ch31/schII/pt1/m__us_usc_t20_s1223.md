## § 1223. Forward funding

    (a) To the end of affording the responsible Federal, State, and local officers adequate notice of available Federal financial assistance for carrying out ongoing education activities and projects, appropriations for grants, contracts, or other payments under any applicable program are authorized to be included in the appropriations Act for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year during which such activities and projects shall be carried out.

    (b) In order to effect a transition to the timing of appropriation action authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the application of this section may result in the enactment, in a fiscal year, of separate appropriations for an applicable program (whether in the same appropriations Act or otherwise) for two consecutive fiscal years.

    A prior [section 420 of Pub. L. 90–247][/us/pl/90/247/s420] was renumbered section 426, and is classified to [section 1228 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1228].

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–382][/us/pl/103/382], § 231, amended section generally.

In order to effect a transition to this method of timing appropriation action, the preceding sentence shall apply notwithstanding that its initial application under such program will result in the enactment in the same year (whether in the same appropriation Act or otherwise) of two separate appropriations, one for the then current fiscal year and one for the succeeding fiscal year.”
