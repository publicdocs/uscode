        (4) __Local application__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Each local educational agency or school requesting a waiver of a Federal statutory or regulatory requirement as described in paragraph (1)(A) and any relevant State statutory or regulatory requirement from a State educational agency shall submit an application to the State educational agency at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the State educational agency may reasonably require.

                (ii) describe the purposes and overall expected results of waiving each such requirement;

                (iii) describe, for each school year, specific, measurable, educational goals for each local educational agency or school affected by the proposed waiver, and for the students served by the local educational agency or school who are affected by the waiver;

                (i) has been inadequate to justify continuation of such waiver; or

                (ii) has decreased for two consecutive years, unless the State educational agency determines that the decrease in performance was justified due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances.

        (5) __Oversight and reporting__ 

            (A) __Oversight__
