## § 6062. Funding for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds that—

        (1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \[[20 U.S.C. 1400][/us/usc/t20/s1400] et seq.\] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;

        (2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and

        (3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

    (b) __Sense of Congress__ 

        It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \[[20 U.S.C. 1400][/us/usc/t20/s1400] et seq.\] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.
