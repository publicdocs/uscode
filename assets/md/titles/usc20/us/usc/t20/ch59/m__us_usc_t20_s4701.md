## § 4701. Findings

The Congress makes the following findings:

    (1) Senator Barry Goldwater of the State of Arizona has served his country for 56 years as a soldier and statesman, including service in the United States Senate for a period of 30 years.

    (2) Senator Goldwater has a distinguished record as a Senator, including service as Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and as Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.

    (3) Senator Goldwater has long maintained a special interest in the education of America’s youth, particularly in the fields of science and mathematics.

    (4) It would, therefore, be a fitting tribute to the leadership, courage, and vision of Senator Goldwater to establish in his name a scholarship program to foster and encourage excellence in science and mathematics.
