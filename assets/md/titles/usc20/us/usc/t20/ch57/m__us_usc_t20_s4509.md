## § 4509. Fellowship conditions

    (a) A student awarded a Madison Fellowship shall continue to receive payments only during such periods as the Foundation finds that the student is maintaining satisfactory progress in an approved program of study or research. Recipients of junior fellowships shall devote essentially full time to their program of study.

    (b) The Foundation is authorized to require reports from any fellowship recipient containing such information, in such form, and to be filed at such times as the Foundation determines to be necessary. Such reports shall be accompanied by a certificate from an appropriate official at the institution of higher education, approved by the Foundation, stating that such student is making satisfactory progress in a program of study or research, with such exceptions as the Foundation may establish.
