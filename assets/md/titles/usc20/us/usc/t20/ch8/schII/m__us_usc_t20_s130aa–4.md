        (2) fails to invest its endowment fund corpus or income in accordance with the investment standards set forth in [section 130aa–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s130aa–2]; or

        (3) fails to account properly to the Secretary concerning investments and expenditures of its endowment fund corpus or income.
