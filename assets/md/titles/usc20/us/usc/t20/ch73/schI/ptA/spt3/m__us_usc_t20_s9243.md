## § 9243. Local administrative cost limits

    (a) __In general__ 

    Subject to subsection (b) of this section, of the amount that is made available under this part to an eligible provider—

        (1) not less than 95 percent shall be expended for carrying out adult education and literacy activities; and

        (2) the remaining amount, not to exceed 5 percent, shall be used for planning, administration, personnel development, and interagency coordination.

    (b) __Special rule__ 

        In cases where the cost limits described in subsection (a) of this section are too restrictive to allow for adequate planning, administration, personnel development, and interagency coordination, the eligible provider shall negotiate with the eligible agency in order to determine an adequate level of funds to be used for noninstructional purposes.
