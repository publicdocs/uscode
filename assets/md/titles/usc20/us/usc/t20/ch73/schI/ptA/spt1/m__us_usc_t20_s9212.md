        For each eligible agency, the eligible agency performance measures shall consist of—

            (A)

                (i) the core indicators of performance described in paragraph (2)(A); and

                (ii) additional indicators of performance (if any) identified by the eligible agency under paragraph (2)(B); and

            (B) an eligible agency adjusted level of performance for each indicator described in subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Indicators of performance__ 

            (A) __Core indicators of performance__ 

            The core indicators of performance shall include the following:

                (i) Demonstrated improvements in literacy skill levels in reading, writing, and speaking the English language, numeracy, problem solving, English language acquisition, and other literacy skills.

                (ii) Placement in, retention in, or completion of, postsecondary education, training, unsubsidized employment or career advancement.

                (iii) Receipt of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent.

            (B) __Additional indicators__ 

                An eligible agency may identify in the State plan additional indicators for adult education and literacy activities authorized under this part.

        (3) __Levels of performance__ 

            (A) __Eligible agency adjusted levels of performance for core indicators__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                For each eligible agency submitting a State plan, there shall be established, in accordance with this subparagraph, levels of performance for each of the core indicators of performance described in paragraph (2)(A) for adult education and literacy activities authorized under this part. The levels of performance established under this subparagraph shall, at a minimum—

                    (I) be expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form; and

                    (II) show the progress of the eligible agency toward continuously improving in performance.

                (ii) __Identification in State plan__ 

                    Each eligible agency shall identify, in the State plan submitted under [section 9224 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s9224], expected levels of performance for each of the core indicators of performance for the first 3 program years covered by the State plan.

                (iii) __Agreement on eligible agency adjusted levels of performance for first 3 years__ 

                    In order to ensure an optimal return on the investment of Federal funds in adult education and literacy activities authorized under this part, the Secretary and each eligible agency shall reach agreement on levels of performance for each of the core indicators of performance, for the first 3 program years covered by the State plan, taking into account the levels identified in the State plan under clause (ii) and the factors described in clause (iv).

                (iv) __Factors__ 

                The agreement described in clause (iii) or (v) shall take into account—

                    (II) the extent to which such levels involved promote continuous improvement in performance on the performance measures by such eligible agency and ensure optimal return on the investment of Federal funds.

                (v) __Agreement on eligible agency adjusted levels of performance for 4th and 5th years__ 

                    Prior to the fourth program year covered by the State plan, the Secretary and each eligible agency shall reach agreement on levels of performance for each of the core indicators of performance for the fourth and fifth program years covered by the State plan, taking into account the factors described in clause (iv). The levels agreed to under this clause shall be considered to be the eligible agency adjusted levels of performance for the eligible agency for such years and shall be incorporated into the State plan.
