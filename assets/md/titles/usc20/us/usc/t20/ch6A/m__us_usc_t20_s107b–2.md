## § 107b–2. Omitted

 __Codification__ 

    Section, [Pub. L. 93–516, title II, § 210][/us/pl/93/516/s210], Dec. 7, 1974, [88 Stat. 1630][/us/stat/88/1630], required the Secretary to promulgate national standards for funds set aside, to study and report the feasibility of establishing retirement, pension, and health insurance systems for blind licensees, and to evaluate the income assignment methods and required the State agencies to submit certain reports.

    The content of [Pub. L. 93–516][/us/pl/93/516], including provisions of section 210 thereof which enacted this section, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974.

    Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Kennedy v. Jones, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation [Pub. L. 93–651][/us/pl/93/651]. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this section should be deemed to have been enacted by [Pub. L. 93–651, title II, § 210][/us/pl/93/651/s210], Nov. 21, 1974, [89 Stat. 2–15][/us/stat/89/2-15], in exactly the same manner as it was enacted by [Pub. L. 93–516][/us/pl/93/516].
