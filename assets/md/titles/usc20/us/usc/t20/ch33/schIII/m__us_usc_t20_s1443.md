## § 1443. Allocation of funds

    (a) __Reservation of funds for outlying areas__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            From the sums appropriated to carry out this subchapter for any fiscal year, the Secretary may reserve not more than 1 percent for payments to Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in accordance with their respective needs for assistance under this subchapter.

        (2) __Consolidation of funds__ 

            The provisions of [Public Law 95–134][/us/pl/95/134], permitting the consolidation of grants to the outlying areas, shall not apply to funds those areas receive under this subchapter.

    (b) __Payments to Indians__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall, subject to this subsection, make payments to the Secretary of the Interior to be distributed to tribes, tribal organizations (as defined under [section 450b of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s450b]), or consortia of the above entities for the coordination of assistance in the provision of early intervention services by the States to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families on reservations served by elementary schools and secondary schools for Indian children operated or funded by the Department of the Interior. The amount of such payment for any fiscal year shall be 1.25 percent of the aggregate of the amount available to all States under this subchapter for such fiscal year.

        (2) __Allocation__ 

            For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Interior shall distribute the entire payment received under paragraph (1) by providing to each tribe, tribal organization, or consortium an amount based on the number of infants and toddlers residing on the reservation, as determined annually, divided by the total of such children served by all tribes, tribal organizations, or consortia.

        (3) __Information__ 

            To receive a payment under this subsection, the tribe, tribal organization, or consortium shall submit such information to the Secretary of the Interior as is needed to determine the amounts to be distributed under paragraph (2).

        (4) __Use of funds__ 

            The funds received by a tribe, tribal organization, or consortium shall be used to assist States in child find, screening, and other procedures for the early identification of Indian children under 3 years of age and for parent training. Such funds may also be used to provide early intervention services in accordance with this subchapter. Such activities may be carried out directly or through contracts or cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, local educational agencies, and other public or private nonprofit organizations. The tribe, tribal organization, or consortium is encouraged to involve Indian parents in the development and implementation of these activities. The above entities shall, as appropriate, make referrals to local, State, or Federal entities for the provision of services or further diagnosis.

        (5) __Reports__ 

            To be eligible to receive a payment under paragraph (2), a tribe, tribal organization, or consortium shall make a biennial report to the Secretary of the Interior of activities undertaken under this subsection, including the number of contracts and cooperative agreements entered into, the number of infants and toddlers contacted and receiving services for each year, and the estimated number of infants and toddlers needing services during the 2 years following the year in which the report is made. The Secretary of the Interior shall include a summary of this information on a biennial basis to the Secretary of Education along with such other information as required under [section 1411(h)(3)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1411/h/3/E]. The Secretary of Education may require any additional information from the Secretary of the Interior.

        (6) __Prohibited uses of funds__ 

            None of the funds under this subsection may be used by the Secretary of the Interior for administrative purposes, including child count, and the provision of technical assistance.

    (c) __State allotments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), from the funds remaining for each fiscal year after the reservation and payments under subsections (a), (b), and (e), the Secretary shall first allot to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such remainder as the number of infants and toddlers in the State bears to the number of infants and toddlers in all States.

        (2) __Minimum allotments__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (3), no State shall receive an amount under this section for any fiscal year that is less than the greater of—

            (A) ½ of 1 percent of the remaining amount described in paragraph (1); or

            (B) $500,000.

        (3) __Ratable reduction__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the sums made available under this subchapter for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all States are eligible to receive under this subsection for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allotments to such States for such year.

            (B) __Additional funds__ 

                If additional funds become available for making payments under this subsection for a fiscal year, allotments that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis the allotments were reduced.

        (4) __Definitions__ 

        In this subsection—

            (A) the terms “infants” and “toddlers” mean children under 3 years of age; and

            (B) the term “State” means each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

    (d) __Reallotment of funds__ 

        If a State elects not to receive its allotment under subsection (c), the Secretary shall reallot, among the remaining States, amounts from such State in accordance with such subsection.

    (e) __Reservation for State incentive grants__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under [section 1444 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1444] exceeds $460,000,000, the Secretary shall reserve 15 percent of such appropriated amount to provide grants to States that are carrying out the policy described in [section 1435(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1435/c] in order to facilitate the implementation of such policy.

        (2) __Amount of grant__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the Secretary shall provide a grant to each State under paragraph (1) in an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount reserved under such paragraph as the number of infants and toddlers in the State bears to the number of infants and toddlers in all States receiving grants under such paragraph.

            (B) __Maximum amount__ 

                No State shall receive a grant under paragraph (1) for any fiscal year in an amount that is greater than 20 percent of the amount reserved under such paragraph for the fiscal year.

        (3) __Carryover of amounts__ 

            (A) __First succeeding fiscal year__ 

                Pursuant to [section 1225(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1225/b], amounts under a grant provided under paragraph (1) that are not obligated and expended prior to the beginning of the first fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which such amounts were appropriated shall remain available for obligation and expenditure during such first succeeding fiscal year.

            (B) __Second succeeding fiscal year__ 

                Amounts under a grant provided under paragraph (1) that are not obligated and expended prior to the beginning of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which such amounts were appropriated shall be returned to the Secretary and used to make grants to States under [section 1433 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1433] (from their allotments under this section) during such second succeeding fiscal year.
