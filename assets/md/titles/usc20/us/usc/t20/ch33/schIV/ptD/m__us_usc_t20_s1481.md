([Pub. L. 91–230, title VI][/us/pl/91/230/tVI], § 681, as added [Pub. L. 108–446, title I][/us/pl/108/446/tI], § 101, Dec. 3, 2004, [118 Stat. 2795][/us/stat/118/2795]; amended [Pub. L. 114–95, title IX][/us/pl/114/95/tIX], § 9215(ss)(11), Dec. 10, 2015, [129 Stat. 2183][/us/stat/129/2183].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 9567b(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s9567b/c], referred to in subsec. (a)(1), was in the original “section 178(c) of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002”, meaning [section 178(c) of Pub. L. 107–279][/us/pl/107/279/s178/c], which was translated as reading [section 177(c) of Pub. L. 107–279][/us/pl/107/279/s177/c], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 107–279][/us/pl/107/279] does not contain a section 178 and section 177(c) of that Act requires development of a plan.

    The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, referred to in subsec. (d)(3)(K), is [Pub. L. 89–10][/us/pl/89/10], Apr. 11, 1965, [79 Stat. 27][/us/stat/79/27]. Title VII of the Act is classified generally to subchapter VII (§ 7701 et seq.) of chapter 70 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 6301 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6301] and Tables.
