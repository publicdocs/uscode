                The Secretary shall not waive under this section any statutory requirements of, or regulatory requirements relating to, applicable civil rights requirements.

        (4) __Termination of waiver__ 

        The Secretary shall terminate a State’s waiver under this section if the Secretary determines that the State—

            (A) needs assistance under [section 1416(d)(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1416/d/2/A/ii] and that the waiver has contributed to or caused such need for assistance;

            (B) needs intervention under [section 1416(d)(2)(A)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1416/d/2/A/iii] or needs substantial intervention under [section 1416(d)(2)(A)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1416/d/2/A/iv]; or
