            (A) __In general__ 

                If any State is dissatisfied with the Secretary’s action with respect to the eligibility of the State under [section 1412 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412], such State may, not later than 60 days after notice of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. A copy of the petition shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings upon which the Secretary’s action was based, as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112].

            (B) __Jurisdiction; review by United States Supreme Court__ 

                Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part.

            (C) __Standard of review__ 

                The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence, and the Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary’s previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

    (f) __State enforcement__ 

        If a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the requirements of this subchapter, including the targets in the State’s performance plan, the State educational agency shall prohibit the local educational agency from reducing the local educational agency’s maintenance of effort under [section 1413(a)(2)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1413/a/2/C] for any fiscal year.

    (g) __Rule of construction__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the Secretary from utilizing any authority under the General Education Provisions Act \[[20 U.S.C. 1221][/us/usc/t20/s1221] et seq.\] to monitor and enforce the requirements of this chapter.

    (h) __Divided State agency responsibility__ 

    For purposes of this section, where responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency pursuant to [section 1412(a)(11)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412/a/11/C], the Secretary, in instances where the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of this subchapter are related to a failure by the public agency, shall take appropriate corrective action to ensure compliance with this subchapter, except that—

        (1) any reduction or withholding of payments to the State shall be proportionate to the total funds allotted under [section 1411 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1411] to the State as the number of eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the State educational agency; and

        (2) any withholding of funds under paragraph (1) shall be limited to the specific agency responsible for the failure to comply with this subchapter.

    (i) __Data capacity and technical assistance review__ 

    The Secretary shall—

        (1) review the data collection and analysis capacity of States to ensure that data and information determined necessary for implementation of this section is collected, analyzed, and accurately reported to the Secretary; and

        (2) provide technical assistance (from funds reserved under [section 1411(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1411/c]), where needed, to improve the capacity of States to meet the data collection requirements.
