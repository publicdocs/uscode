## § 1413. Local educational agency eligibility

    (a) __In general__ 

    A local educational agency is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if such agency submits a plan that provides assurances to the State educational agency that the local educational agency meets each of the following conditions:

        (1) __Consistency with State policies__ 

            The local educational agency, in providing for the education of children with disabilities within its jurisdiction, has in effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established under [section 1412 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412].

        (2) __Use of amounts__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Amounts provided to the local educational agency under this subchapter shall be expended in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subchapter and—

                (i) shall be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities;

                (ii) shall be used to supplement State, local, and other Federal funds and not to supplant such funds; and

                (iii) shall not be used, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), to reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with disabilities made by the local educational agency from local funds below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            Notwithstanding the restriction in subparagraph (A)(iii), a local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures where such reduction is attributable to—

                (i) the voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or departure for just cause, of special education personnel;

                (ii) a decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities;

                (iii)

                 the termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with this subchapter, to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the State educational agency, because the child—

                    (I) has left the jurisdiction of the agency;

                    (II) has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide a free appropriate public education to the child has terminated; or

                    (III) no longer needs such program of special education; or

                (iv) the termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.

            (C) __Adjustment to local fiscal effort in certain fiscal years__ 

                (i) __Amounts in excess__ 

                    Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which the allocation received by a local educational agency under [section 1411(f) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1411/f] exceeds the amount the local educational agency received for the previous fiscal year, the local educational agency may reduce the level of expenditures otherwise required by subparagraph (A)(iii) by not more than 50 percent of the amount of such excess.

                (ii) __Use of amounts to carry out activities under ESEA__ 

                    If a local educational agency exercises the authority under clause (i), the agency shall use an amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures under clause (i) to carry out activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \[[20 U.S.C. 6301][/us/usc/t20/s6301] et seq.\].

                (iii) __State prohibition__ 

                    Notwithstanding clause (i), if a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is unable to establish and maintain programs of free appropriate public education that meet the requirements of subsection (a) or the State educational agency has taken action against the local educational agency under [section 1416 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1416], the State educational agency shall prohibit the local educational agency from reducing the level of expenditures under clause (i) for that fiscal year.

                (iv) __Special rule__ 

                    The amount of funds expended by a local educational agency under subsection (f) shall count toward the maximum amount of expenditures such local educational agency may reduce under clause (i).

            (D) __Schoolwide programs under title I of the ESEA__ 

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) or any other provision of this subchapter, a local educational agency may use funds received under this subchapter for any fiscal year to carry out a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \[[20 U.S.C. 6314][/us/usc/t20/s6314]\], except that the amount so used in any such program shall not exceed—

                (i) the number of children with disabilities participating in the schoolwide program; multiplied by

                (ii)

                    (I) the amount received by the local educational agency under this subchapter for that fiscal year; divided by

                    (II) the number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of that agency.

        (3) __Personnel development__ 

            The local educational agency shall ensure that all personnel necessary to carry out this subchapter are appropriately and adequately prepared, subject to the requirements of [section 1412(a)(14) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412/a/14] and section 2102(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \[[20 U.S.C. 6612(b)][/us/usc/t20/s6612/b]\].

        (4) __Permissive use of funds__ 

            (A) __Uses__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(A) or [section 1412(a)(17)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412/a/17/B] (relating to commingled funds), funds provided to the local educational agency under this subchapter may be used for the following activities:

                (i) __Services and aids that also benefit nondisabled children__ 

                    For the costs of special education and related services, and supplementary aids and services, provided in a regular class or other education-related setting to a child with a disability in accordance with the individualized education program of the child, even if 1 or more nondisabled children benefit from such services.

                (ii) __Early intervening services__ 

                    To develop and implement coordinated, early intervening educational services in accordance with subsection (f).

                (iii) __High cost education and related services__ 

                    To establish and implement cost or risk sharing funds, consortia, or cooperatives for the local educational agency itself, or for local educational agencies working in a consortium of which the local educational agency is a part, to pay for high cost special education and related services.

            (B) __Administrative case management__ 

                A local educational agency may use funds received under this subchapter to purchase appropriate technology for recordkeeping, data collection, and related case management activities of teachers and related services personnel providing services described in the individualized education program of children with disabilities, that is needed for the implementation of such case management activities.

        (5) __Treatment of charter schools and their students__ 

        In carrying out this subchapter with respect to charter schools that are public schools of the local educational agency, the local educational agency—

            (A) serves children with disabilities attending those charter schools in the same manner as the local educational agency serves children with disabilities in its other schools, including providing supplementary and related services on site at the charter school to the same extent to which the local educational agency has a policy or practice of providing such services on the site to its other public schools; and

            (B)

             provides funds under this subchapter to those charter schools—

                (i) on the same basis as the local educational agency provides funds to the local educational agency’s other public schools, including proportional distribution based on relative enrollment of children with disabilities; and

                (ii) at the same time as the agency distributes other Federal funds to the agency’s other public schools, consistent with the State’s charter school law.

        (6) __Purchase of instructional materials__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Not later than 2 years after December 3, 2004, a local educational agency that chooses to coordinate with the National Instructional Materials Access Center, when purchasing print instructional materials, shall acquire the print instructional materials in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as a State educational agency acquires print instructional materials under [section 1412(a)(23) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1412/a/23].

            (B) __Rights of local educational agency__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a local educational agency to coordinate with the National Instructional Materials Access Center.

    (b) __Exception for prior local plans__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If a local educational agency or State agency has on file with the State educational agency policies and procedures that demonstrate that such local educational agency, or such State agency, as the case may be, meets any requirement of subsection (a), including any policies and procedures filed under this subchapter as in effect before the effective date of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the State educational agency shall consider such local educational agency or State agency, as the case may be, to have met such requirement for purposes of receiving assistance under this subchapter.

        (2) __Modification made by local educational agency__

        (2) __Additional requirement__ 

            Any State agency or local educational agency in receipt of a notice described in paragraph (1) shall, by means of public notice, take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within the jurisdiction of such agency.

            (B) __Charter school exception__ 

                A State educational agency may not require a charter school that is a local educational agency to jointly establish its eligibility under subparagraph (A) unless the charter school is explicitly permitted to do so under the State’s charter school law.

        (2) __Activities__ 

        In implementing coordinated, early intervening services under this subsection, a local educational agency may carry out activities that include—

            (A) professional development (which may be provided by entities other than local educational agencies) for teachers and other school staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic instruction and behavioral interventions, including scientifically based literacy instruction, and, where appropriate, instruction on the use of adaptive and instructional software; and

        (2) the agency meets such other conditions of this section as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

    (i) __Disciplinary information__ 

        The State may require that a local educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same extent that such disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children. The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child.
