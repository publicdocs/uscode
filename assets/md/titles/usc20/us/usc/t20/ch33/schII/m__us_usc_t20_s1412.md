## § 1412. State eligibility

    (a) __In general__ 

    A State is eligible for assistance under this subchapter for a fiscal year if the State submits a plan that provides assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that the State meets each of the following conditions:

        (1) __Free appropriate public education__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.

            (B) __Limitation__ 

            The obligation to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to children—

                (i) aged 3 through 5 and 18 through 21 in a State to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with State law or practice, or the order of any court, respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges; and

                (ii)

                 aged 18 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require that special education and related services under this subchapter be provided to children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to their incarceration in an adult correctional facility—

                    (I) were not actually identified as being a child with a disability under [section 1401 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1401]; or

                    (II) did not have an individualized education program under this subchapter.

            (C) __State flexibility__ 

                A State that provides early intervention services in accordance with subchapter III to a child who is eligible for services under [section 1419 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1419], is not required to provide such child with a free appropriate public education.

        (2) __Full educational opportunity goal__ 

            The State has established a goal of providing full educational opportunity to all children with disabilities and a detailed timetable for accomplishing that goal.

        (3) __Child find__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                All children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities who are homeless children or are wards of the State and children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of the severity of their disabilities, and who are in need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated and a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services.

            (B) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in [section 1401 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1401] and who, by reason of that disability, needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.

        (4) __Individualized education program__ 

            An individualized education program, or an individualized family service plan that meets the requirements of [section 1436(d) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1436/d], is developed, reviewed, and revised for each child with a disability in accordance with [section 1414(d) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1414/d].

        (5) __Least restrictive environment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

            (B) __Additional requirement__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A State funding mechanism shall not result in placements that violate the requirements of subparagraph (A), and a State shall not use a funding mechanism by which the State distributes funds on the basis of the type of setting in which a child is served that will result in the failure to provide a child with a disability a free appropriate public education according to the unique needs of the child as described in the child’s IEP.

                (ii) __Assurance__ 

                    If the State does not have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with clause (i), the State shall provide the Secretary an assurance that the State will revise the funding mechanism as soon as feasible to ensure that such mechanism does not result in such placements.

        (6) __Procedural safeguards__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Children with disabilities and their parents are afforded the procedural safeguards required by [section 1415 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1415].

            (B) __Additional procedural safeguards__ 

                Procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and procedures utilized for the purposes of evaluation and placement of children with disabilities for services under this chapter will be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. Such materials or procedures shall be provided and administered in the child’s native language or mode of communication, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so, and no single procedure shall be the sole criterion for determining an appropriate educational program for a child.

        (7) __Evaluation__ 

            Children with disabilities are evaluated in accordance with subsections (a) through (c) of [section 1414 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1414].

        (8) __Confidentiality__ 

            Agencies in the State comply with [section 1417(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1417/c] (relating to the confidentiality of records and information).

        (9) __Transition from subchapter III to preschool programs__ 

            Children participating in early intervention programs assisted under subchapter III, and who will participate in preschool programs assisted under this subchapter, experience a smooth and effective transition to those preschool programs in a manner consistent with [section 1437(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1437/a/9]. By the third birthday of such a child, an individualized education program or, if consistent with sections 1414(d)(2)(B) and 1436(d) of this title, an individualized family service plan, has been developed and is being implemented for the child. The local educational agency will participate in transition planning conferences arranged by the designated lead agency under [section 1435(a)(10) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1435/a/10].

        (10) __Children in private schools__ 

            (A) __Children enrolled in private schools by their parents__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                To the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled by their parents in private elementary schools and secondary schools in the school district served by a local educational agency, provision is made for the participation of those children in the program assisted or carried out under this subchapter by providing for such children special education and related services in accordance with the following requirements, unless the Secretary has arranged for services to those children under subsection (f):

                    (I) Amounts to be expended for the provision of those services (including direct services to parentally placed private school children) by the local educational agency shall be equal to a proportionate amount of Federal funds made available under this subchapter.

                    (II) In calculating the proportionate amount of Federal funds, the local educational agency, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools as described in clause (iii), shall conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally placed children with disabilities attending private schools located in the local educational agency.

                    (III) Such services to parentally placed private school children with disabilities may be provided to the children on the premises of private, including religious, schools, to the extent consistent with law.

                    (IV) State and local funds may supplement and in no case shall supplant the proportionate amount of Federal funds required to be expended under this subparagraph.

                    (V) Each local educational agency shall maintain in its records and provide to the State educational agency the number of children evaluated under this subparagraph, the number of children determined to be children with disabilities under this paragraph, and the number of children served under this paragraph.

                (ii) __Child find requirement__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The requirements of paragraph (3) (relating to child find) shall apply with respect to children with disabilities in the State who are enrolled in private, including religious, elementary schools and secondary schools.

                    (II) __Equitable participation__ 

                        The child find process shall be designed to ensure the equitable participation of parentally placed private school children with disabilities and an accurate count of such children.

                    (III) __Activities__ 

                        In carrying out this clause, the local educational agency, or where applicable, the State educational agency, shall undertake activities similar to those activities undertaken for the agency’s public school children.

                    (IV) __Cost__ 

                        The cost of carrying out this clause, including individual evaluations, may not be considered in determining whether a local educational agency has met its obligations under clause (i).

                    (V) __Completion period__ 

                        Such child find process shall be completed in a time period comparable to that for other students attending public schools in the local educational agency.

                (iii) __Consultation__ 

                To ensure timely and meaningful consultation, a local educational agency, or where appropriate, a State educational agency, shall consult with private school representatives and representatives of parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities during the design and development of special education and related services for the children, including regarding—

                    (I) the child find process and how parentally placed private school children suspected of having a disability can participate equitably, including how parents, teachers, and private school officials will be informed of the process;

                    (II) the determination of the proportionate amount of Federal funds available to serve parentally placed private school children with disabilities under this subparagraph, including the determination of how the amount was calculated;

                    (III) the consultation process among the local educational agency, private school officials, and representatives of parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including how such process will operate throughout the school year to ensure that parentally placed private school children with disabilities identified through the child find process can meaningfully participate in special education and related services;

                    (IV) how, where, and by whom special education and related services will be provided for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including a discussion of types of services, including direct services and alternate service delivery mechanisms, how such services will be apportioned if funds are insufficient to serve all children, and how and when these decisions will be made; and

                    (V) how, if the local educational agency disagrees with the views of the private school officials on the provision of services or the types of services, whether provided directly or through a contract, the local educational agency shall provide to the private school officials a written explanation of the reasons why the local educational agency chose not to provide services directly or through a contract.

                (iv) __Written affirmation__ 

                    When timely and meaningful consultation as required by clause (iii) has occurred, the local educational agency shall obtain a written affirmation signed by the representatives of participating private schools, and if such representatives do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the local educational agency shall forward the documentation of the consultation process to the State educational agency.

                (v) __Compliance__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        A private school official shall have the right to submit a complaint to the State educational agency that the local educational agency did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official.

                    (II) __Procedure__ 

                        If the private school official wishes to submit a complaint, the official shall provide the basis of the noncompliance with this subparagraph by the local educational agency to the State educational agency, and the local educational agency shall forward the appropriate documentation to the State educational agency. If the private school official is dissatisfied with the decision of the State educational agency, such official may submit a complaint to the Secretary by providing the basis of the noncompliance with this subparagraph by the local educational agency to the Secretary, and the State educational agency shall forward the appropriate documentation to the Secretary.

                    (II) __Secular, neutral, nonideological__ 

                        Special education and related services provided to parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including materials and equipment, shall be secular, neutral, and nonideological.

                (vii) __Public control of funds__ 

                    The control of funds used to provide special education and related services under this subparagraph, and title to materials, equipment, and property purchased with those funds, shall be in a public agency for the uses and purposes provided in this chapter, and a public agency shall administer the funds and property.

            (B) __Children placed in, or referred to, private schools by public agencies__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Children with disabilities in private schools and facilities are provided special education and related services, in accordance with an individualized education program, at no cost to their parents, if such children are placed in, or referred to, such schools or facilities by the State or appropriate local educational agency as the means of carrying out the requirements of this subchapter or any other applicable law requiring the provision of special education and related services to all children with disabilities within such State.

                (ii) __Standards__ 

                    In all cases described in clause (i), the State educational agency shall determine whether such schools and facilities meet standards that apply to State educational agencies and local educational agencies and that children so served have all the rights the children would have if served by such agencies.

            (C) __Payment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to subparagraph (A), this subchapter does not require a local educational agency to pay for the cost of education, including special education and related services, of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.

                (ii) __Reimbursement for private school placement__ 

                    If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.

                (iii) __Limitation on reimbursement__ 

                The cost of reimbursement described in clause (ii) may be reduced or denied—

                    (I)

                     if—

                        (aa) at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide a free appropriate public education to their child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public expense; or

                        (bb) 10 business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information described in item (aa);

                    (II) if, prior to the parents’ removal of the child from the public school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice requirements described in [section 1415(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1415/b/3], of its intent to evaluate the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child available for such evaluation; or

                    (III) upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents.

                (iv) __Exception__ 

                Notwithstanding the notice requirement in clause (iii)(I), the cost of reimbursement—

                    (I)

                     shall not be reduced or denied for failure to provide such notice if—

                        (aa) the school prevented the parent from providing such notice;

                        (bb) the parents had not received notice, pursuant to [section 1415 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1415], of the notice requirement in clause (iii)(I); or

                        (cc) compliance with clause (iii)(I) would likely result in physical harm to the child; and

                    (II)

                     may, in the discretion of a court or a hearing officer, not be reduced or denied for failure to provide such notice if—

                        (aa) the parent is illiterate or cannot write in English; or

            (B) __Accommodation guidelines__ 

                The State (or, in the case of a districtwide assessment, the local educational agency) has developed guidelines for the provision of appropriate accommodations.

            (C) __Alternate assessments__ 

                (i) __In general__

                (iii) The number of children with disabilities participating in alternate assessments described in subparagraph (C)(ii)(II).

                (iv) The performance of children with disabilities on regular assessments and on alternate assessments (if the number of children with disabilities participating in those assessments is sufficient to yield statistically reliable information and reporting that information will not reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student), compared with the achievement of all children, including children with disabilities, on those assessments.

            (E) __Universal design__ 

                The State educational agency (or, in the case of a districtwide assessment, the local educational agency) shall, to the extent feasible, use universal design principles in developing and administering any assessments under this paragraph.

            (A) __In general__

                The Secretary shall reduce the allocation of funds under [section 1411 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1411] for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State fails to comply with the requirement of subparagraph (A) by the same amount by which the State fails to meet the requirement.

            (C) __Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances__ 

            The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) for a State, for 1 fiscal year at a time, if the Secretary determines that—

                (i) granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State; or

                (ii) the State meets the standard in paragraph (17)(C) for a waiver of the requirement to supplement, and not to supplant, funds received under this subchapter.

            Prior to the adoption of any policies and procedures needed to comply with this section (including any amendments to such policies and procedures), the State ensures that there are public hearings, adequate notice of the hearings, and an opportunity for comment available to the general public, including individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities.
