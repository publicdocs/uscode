            (A) __Allocation__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall—

                    (I) allocate to each State the amount the State received under this section for fiscal year 1997;

                    (II) allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to States on the basis of the States’ relative populations of children aged 3 through 5; and

                    (III) allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to States on the basis of the States’ relative populations of all children aged 3 through 5 who are living in poverty.

                (ii) __Data__ 

                    For the purpose of making grants under this paragraph, the Secretary shall use the most recent population data, including data on children living in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the Secretary.

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), allocations under this paragraph shall be subject to the following:

                (i) __Preceding years__

                        (aa) the amount the State received under this section for the preceding fiscal year; and

                        (bb) that amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase in the funds appropriated under this section from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or

                     the sum of—

                        (aa) the amount the State received under this section for the preceding fiscal year; and

                (i) the amount the State received under this section for fiscal year 1997; and

                (ii) an amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as the increase the State received under this section for the preceding fiscal year over fiscal year 1997 bears to the total of all such increases for all States.

            (B) __Ratable reductions__ 

                If the amount available for allocations is equal to or less than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State shall be allocated the amount the State received for fiscal year 1997, ratably reduced, if necessary.

        (6) at the State’s discretion, to continue service coordination or case management for families who receive services under subchapter III.

    (g) __Subgrants to local educational agencies__ 

        (1) __Subgrants required__ 

        Each State that receives a grant under this section for any fiscal year shall distribute all of the grant funds that the State does not reserve under subsection (d) to local educational agencies in the State that have established their eligibility under [section 1413 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1413], as follows:

            (A) __Base payments__ 

                The State shall first award each local educational agency described in paragraph (1) the amount that agency would have received under this section for fiscal year 1997 if the State had distributed 75 percent of its grant for that year under [section 1419(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1419/c/3], as such section was then in effect.

            (B) __Allocation of remaining funds__ 

            After making allocations under subparagraph (A), the State shall—

                (i) allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those local educational agencies on the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the local educational agency’s jurisdiction; and

                (ii) allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those local educational agencies in accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, as determined by the State educational agency.

        (2) __Reallocation of funds__ 

            If a State educational agency determines that a local educational agency is adequately providing a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the area served by the local educational agency with State and local funds, the State educational agency may reallocate any portion of the funds under this section that are not needed by that local educational agency to provide a free appropriate public education to other local educational agencies in the State that are not adequately providing special education and related services to all children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the areas the other local educational agencies serve.

    (h) __Subchapter III inapplicable__ 

        Subchapter III does not apply to any child with a disability receiving a free appropriate public education, in accordance with this subchapter, with funds received under this section.
