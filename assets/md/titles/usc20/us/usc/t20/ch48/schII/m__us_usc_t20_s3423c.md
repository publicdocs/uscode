([Pub. L. 96–88, title II, § 215][/us/pl/96/88/s215], as added [Pub. L. 103–382, title III, § 372(2)][/us/pl/103/382/s372/2], Oct. 20, 1994, [108 Stat. 3977][/us/stat/108/3977].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This title, referred to in subsec. (b)(2)(A), is title II of [Pub. L. 96–88][/us/pl/96/88], Oct. 17, 1979, [93 Stat. 671][/us/stat/93/671], which is classified to this subchapter, but probably should have been a reference to part A of title IX of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Part A of title IX of that Act was classified generally to part A (§ 7801 et seq.) of subchapter IX of chapter 70 of this title, prior to general amendment by [Pub. L. 107–110, title IX][/us/pl/107/110], §  901, Jan. 8, 2002, [115 Stat. 1956][/us/stat/115/1956]. Provisions similar to those formerly appearing in part A of title IX are contained in part A of title VII of that Act, which is classified generally to part A (§ 7401 et seq.) of subchapter VII of chapter 70 of this title. For complete classification of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 6301 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6301] and Tables.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior [section 215 of Pub. L. 96–88][/us/pl/96/88/s215] was renumbered section 217 and is classified to [section 3424 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3424].

    Provisions similar to those in this section were contained in [section 2641 of Title 25][/us/usc/t25/s2641], Indians, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 103–382, § 367][/us/pl/103/382/s367].

 __Office of Educational Research and Improvement__ 

    The Office of Educational Research and Improvement was established by [section 3419 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s3419]. Section 3419 was repealed and a new section 3419 establishing the Institute of Educational Sciences was enacted by [Pub. L. 107–279, title IV, § 402(2)][/us/pl/107/279/s402/2], Nov. 5, 2002, [116 Stat. 1985][/us/stat/116/1985].
