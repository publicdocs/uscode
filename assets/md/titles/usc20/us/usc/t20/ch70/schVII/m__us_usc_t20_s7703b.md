    (a) __Assistance to schools with significant numbers of military dependent students__ 

        (1) __Assistance authorized__

        (2) __Eligible local educational agencies__ 

            A local educational agency is eligible for assistance under this subsection for a fiscal year if at least 20 percent (as rounded to the nearest whole percent) of the students in average daily attendance in the schools of the local educational agency during the preceding school year were military dependent students counted under [section 7703(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7703/a/1].

    (b) __Assistance to schools with enrollment changes due to base closures, force structure changes, or force relocations__ 

        (1) __Assistance authorized__ 

        To assist communities in making adjustments resulting from changes in the size or location of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of Defense shall provide financial assistance to an eligible local educational agency described in paragraph (2) if, during the period between the end of the school year preceding the fiscal year for which the assistance is authorized and the beginning of the school year immediately preceding that school year, the local educational agency had (as determined by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of Education) an overall increase or reduction of—

            (A) not less than five percent in the average daily attendance of military dependent students in the schools of the local educational agency; or

            (B) not less than 250 military dependent students in average daily attendance in the schools of the local educational agency.

        (2) __Eligible local educational agencies__ 

        A local educational agency is eligible for assistance under this subsection for a fiscal year if—

            (A) the local educational agency is eligible for assistance under subsection (a) of this section for the same fiscal year, or would have been eligible for such assistance if not for the reduction in military dependent students in schools of the local educational agency; and

            (B)

        (3) __Calculation of amount of assistance__ 

            (A) __Pro rata distribution__ 

            The amount of the assistance provided under this subsection to a local educational agency that is eligible for such assistance for a fiscal year shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

                (i) the per-student rate determined under subparagraph (B) for that fiscal year; by

                (ii) the net of the overall increases and reductions in the number of military dependent students in schools of the local educational agency, as determined under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Per-student rate__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the per-student rate for a fiscal year shall be equal to the dollar amount obtained by dividing—

                (i) the total amount of funds made available for that fiscal year to provide assistance under this subsection; by

                (ii) the sum of the overall increases and reductions in the number of military dependent students in schools of all eligible local educational agencies for that fiscal year under this subsection.

            (C) __Maximum amount of assistance__ 

                A local educational agency may not receive more than $1,000,000 in assistance under this subsection for any fiscal year.

        (4) __Duration__ 

            Assistance may not be provided under this subsection after September 30, 2014.
