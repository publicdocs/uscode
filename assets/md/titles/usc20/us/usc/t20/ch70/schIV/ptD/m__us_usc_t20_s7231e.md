## § 7231e. Priority

    (2)

     propose to—

        (A) carry out a new, evidence-based magnet school program;

        (B) significantly revise an existing magnet school program, using evidence-based methods and practices, as available; or

        (C) replicate an existing magnet school program that has a demonstrated record of success in increasing student academic achievement and reducing isolation of minority groups;

    (3) propose to select students to attend magnet school programs by methods such as lottery, rather than through academic examination; and

    (4) propose to increase racial integration by taking into account socioeconomic diversity in designing and implementing magnet school programs.
