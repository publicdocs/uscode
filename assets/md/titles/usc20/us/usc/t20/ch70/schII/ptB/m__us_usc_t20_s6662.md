            (A)

             shall—

                (i) directly relate to the curriculum and academic areas in which the teacher provides instruction, and focus only secondarily on pedagogy;

                (ii) enhance the ability of the teacher to understand and use the challenging State academic content standards for mathematics and science and to select appropriate curricula; and

                (iii)

                 train teachers to use curricula that are—

                    (I) based on scientific research;

                    (II) aligned with challenging State academic content standards; and

                    (III) object-centered, experiment-oriented, and concept- and content-based; and

            (B)

             may include—

                (i) programs that provide teachers and prospective teachers with opportunities to work under the guidance of experienced teachers and college faculty;

                (ii) instruction in the use of data and assessments to inform and instruct classroom practice; and
