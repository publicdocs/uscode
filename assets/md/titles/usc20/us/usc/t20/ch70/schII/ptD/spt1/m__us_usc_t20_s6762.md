            (B) From 50 percent of the remainder and subject to subsection (b) of this section, the State educational agency shall award subgrants, through a State-determined competitive process, to eligible local entities that have submitted applications to the State educational agency under [section 6764 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6764], for the activities described in [section 6766 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6766].

                (i) received allocations under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section that are not of sufficient size to be effective, consistent with the purposes of this part; and

                (ii) are eligible local entities;

            (B) give priority to applications submitted by eligible local educational agencies described in subparagraph (A); and

            (C) determine the minimum amount for awards under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section to ensure that subgrants awarded under that subsection are of sufficient size to be effective.

        (2) __Sufficiency__ 

            In awarding subgrants under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, each State educational agency shall ensure that each subgrant is of sufficient size and duration, and that the program funded by the subgrant is of sufficient scope and quality, to carry out the purposes of this part effectively.

        (3) __Distribution__ 

            In awarding subgrants under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, each State educational agency shall ensure an equitable distribution of assistance under this subpart among urban and rural areas of the State, according to the demonstrated need of those local educational agencies serving the areas.

    (c) __Fiscal agent__ 

        If an eligible local partnership receives a subgrant under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, a local educational agency in the partnership shall serve as the fiscal agent for the partnership.
