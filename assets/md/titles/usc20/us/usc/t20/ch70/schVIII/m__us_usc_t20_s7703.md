## § 7703. Payments for eligible federally connected children

    (a) __Computation of payment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) or (d) of this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools—

            (A)

                (i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or

                (ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;

            (B) resided on Federal property and had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined in [section 101 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s101]);

            (C) resided on Indian lands;

            (D)

                (i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by [section 101 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s101]) but did not reside on Federal property; or

                (ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;

            (E) resided in low-rent housing;

            (F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or

            (G)

             resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated—

                (i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or

                (ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.

        (2) __Determination of weighted student units__ 

        For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:

            (A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.

            (B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.

            (C)

             Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has—

                (i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 5,000; and

                (ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.

            (D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .20.

            (E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.

            (F) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.

        (3) __Special rule__ 

            The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.

        (4) __Military installation and Indian housing undergoing renovation or rebuilding__ 

            (A) __Military installation housing__ 

            Beginning in fiscal year 2014, in determining the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider those children as if they were children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that those children would have resided in housing on Federal property if the housing was not undergoing renovation or rebuilding. The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(B) shall not exceed the lessor of—

                (i) the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(B) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

                (ii) the total number of Federally connected children enrolled at the local educational agency as stated in the application filed for the payment for the year for which the determination is made.

            (B) __Indian lands__ 

            Beginning in fiscal year 2014, in determining the amount of a payment for a local educational agency that received a payment for children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application, the Secretary shall consider those children to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) if the Secretary determines on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that those children would have resided in housing on Indian lands if the housing was not undergoing renovation or rebuilding. The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(C) shall not exceed the lessor of—

                (i) the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(C) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

                (ii) the total number of Federally connected children enrolled at the local educational agency as stated in the application filed for the payment for the year for which the determination is made.

            (C) __Eligible housing__ 

                Renovation or rebuilding shall be defined as projects considered as capitalization, modernization, or restoration, as defined by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Interior (as the case may be) and are projects that last more than 30 days, but do not include “sustainment projects” such as painting, carpeting, or minor repairs.

        (5) __Military “Build to Lease” program housing__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of computing the amount of payment for a local educational agency for children identified under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider children residing in housing initially acquired or constructed under the former [section 2828(g) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2828/g] (commonly known as the “Build to Lease” program), as added by section 801 of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1984, to be children described under paragraph (1)(B) if the property described is within the fenced security perimeter of the military facility upon which such housing is situated.

            (B) __Additional requirements__ 

            If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary—

                (i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and

                (ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.

    (b) __Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency__ 

        (1) __Basic support payments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                From the amount appropriated under [section 7714(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7714/b] for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.

            (B) __Eligibility__ 

            A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of—

                (i) at least 400 such children; or

                (ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.

            (C) __Maximum amount__ 

            The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of—

                (i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

                (ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

                (iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994; or

                (iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.

            (D) __Data__ 

                If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.

            (E) __Special rule__ 

                For purposes of determining the comparable local contribution rate under subparagraph (C)(iii) for a local educational agency described in section 222.39(c)(3) of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, that had its comparable local contribution rate for fiscal year 1998 calculated pursuant to section 222.39 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary shall determine such comparable local contribution rate as the rate upon which payments under this subsection for fiscal year 2000 were made to the local educational agency adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the per pupil expenditure in the State serving the local educational agency calculated on the basis of the second most recent preceding school year compared to the third most recent preceding school year for which school year data are available.

            (F) __Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors__ 

                If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.

            (G) Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.

        (2) __Basic support payments for heavily impacted local educational agencies__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) From the amount appropriated under [section 7714(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7714/b] for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible heavily impacted local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a) of this section.

                (ii) A local educational agency that receives a basic support payment under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall not be eligible to receive a basic support payment under paragraph (1) for that fiscal year.

            (B) __Eligibility for continuing heavily impacted local educational agencies__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                A heavily impacted local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section if the agency—

                    (I) received an additional assistance payment under subsection (f) of this section (as such subsection was in effect on the day before October 30, 2000) for fiscal year 2000; and

                    (II)

                        (aa) is a local educational agency whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation;

                        (bb) has an enrollment of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section that constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of the agency which is not less than 35 percent, has a per-pupil expenditure that is less than the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the agency is located or the average per-pupil expenditure of all States (whichever average per-pupil expenditure is greater), except that a local educational agency with a total student enrollment of less than 350 students shall be deemed to have satisfied such per-pupil expenditure requirement, and has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is not less than 95 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of local educational agencies in the State;

                        (cc) has an enrollment of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section that constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of the agency which is not less than 30 percent, and has a tax rate for general fund purposes which is not less than 125 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes for comparable local educational agencies in the State;

                        (dd) has a total student enrollment of not less than 25,000 students, of which not less than 50 percent are children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and not less than 6,000 of such children are children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section; or

                (ii) __Loss of eligibility__ 

                    A heavily impacted local educational agency that met the requirements of clause (i) for a fiscal year shall be ineligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) if the agency fails to meet the requirements of clause (i) for a subsequent fiscal year, except that such agency shall continue to receive a basic support payment under this paragraph for the fiscal year for which the ineligibility determination is made.

                (iii) __Resumption of eligibility__ 

                    A heavily impacted local educational agency described in clause (i) that becomes ineligible under such clause for 1 or more fiscal years may resume eligibility for a basic support payment under this paragraph for a subsequent fiscal year only if the agency meets the requirements of clause (i) for that subsequent fiscal year, except that such agency shall not receive a basic support payment under this paragraph until the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which the eligibility determination is made.

            (C) __Eligibility for new heavily impacted local educational agencies__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                A heavily impacted local educational agency that did not receive an additional assistance payment under subsection (f) of this section (as such subsection was in effect on the day before October 30, 2000) for fiscal year 2000 is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for fiscal year 2002 and any subsequent fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the agency is a local educational agency whose boundaries are the same as a Federal military installation (or if the agency is a qualified local educational agency as described in clause (iv)), or the agency—

                    (I)

                     has an enrollment of children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section that constitutes a percentage of the total student enrollment of the agency that—

                        (aa) is not less than 50 percent if such agency receives a payment on behalf of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of such subsection; or

                        (bb) is not less than 40 percent if such agency does not receive a payment on behalf of such children;

                    (II)

                (i)

                 Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the maximum amount that a heavily impacted local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section and subject to clause (ii), multiplied by the greater of—

                    (I) four-fifths of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made; or

                    (II) four-fifths of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

                (ii)

                    (I) For a local educational agency with respect to which 35 percent or more of the total student enrollment of the schools of the agency are children described in subparagraph (D) or (E) (or a combination thereof) of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the weighted student units of such children for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 0.55.

                    (II) For a local educational agency that has an enrollment of 100 or fewer children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 1.75.

                    (III) For a local educational agency that does not qualify under (B)(i)(II)(aa)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph (2)(B)(i)(II)(aa)”. </sup></sup>  of this subsection and has an enrollment of more than 100 but not more than 1,000 children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 1.25.

            (E) __Maximum amount for large heavily impacted local educational agencies__ 

                (i)

                    (I) Subject to clause (ii), the maximum amount that a heavily impacted local educational agency described in subclause (II) is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with the formula described in paragraph (1)(C).

                    (II) A heavily impacted local educational agency described in this subclause is a local educational agency that has a total student enrollment of not less than 25,000 students, of which not less than 50 percent are children described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and not less than 6,000 of such children are children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section.

                (ii) For purposes of calculating the maximum amount described in clause (i), the factor used in determining the weighted student units under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be 1.35.

            (F) __Data__

            (H) __Eligibility for heavily impacted local educational agencies affected by privatization of military housing__ 

                (i) __Eligibility__ 

                    For any fiscal year, a heavily impacted local educational agency that received a basic support payment under this paragraph for the prior fiscal year, but is ineligible for such payment for the current fiscal year under subparagraph (B), (C), (D), or (E), as the case may be, by reason of the conversion of military housing units to private housing described in clause (iii), shall be deemed to meet the eligibility requirements under subparagraph (B) or (C), as the case may be, for the period during which the housing units are undergoing such conversion.

                (ii) __Amount of payment__ 

                    The amount of a payment to a heavily impacted local educational agency for a fiscal year by reason of the application of clause (i), and calculated in accordance with subparagraph (D) or (E), as the case may be, shall be based on the number of children in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency for the fiscal year and under the same provisions of subparagraph (D) or (E) under which the agency was paid during the prior fiscal year.

                (iii) __Conversion of military housing units to private housing described__ 

                    For purposes of clause (i), “conversion of military housing units to private housing” means the conversion of military housing units to private housing units pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10 or pursuant to any other related provision of law.

        (3) __Payments with respect to fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under [section 7714(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7714/b] are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.

            (B) __Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (1)__ 

                (i)

                 For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the “threshold payment”) in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (1) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding—

                    (I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and

                    (II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph, and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.

                (ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.

                (iii) For the purpose of determining the percentages described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) that are applicable to the local educational agency providing free public education to students in grades 9 through 12 residing on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the Secretary shall consider only that portion of such agency’s total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under such subclause (I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under subclause (II).

                (iv) In the case of a local educational agency that has a total student enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students and that has a per-pupil expenditure that is less than the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the agency is located or less than the average per-pupil expenditure of all the States, the total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under clause (i) shall not be less than 40 percent.

            (C) __Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (2)__ 

                For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the learning opportunity threshold payment in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (2) shall be equal to the amount obtained under subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph (2), as the case may be.

            (D) __Ratable distribution__ 

                For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make payments as a ratable distribution based upon the computations made under subparagraphs (B) and (C).

        (4) __States with only one local educational agency__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In any of the 50 States of the United States in which there is only one local educational agency, the Secretary shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) or subparagraphs (B) through (D) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, paragraph (3) of this subsection, and subsection (e) of this section, consider each administrative school district in the State to be a separate local educational agency.

            (B) __Computation of maximum amount of basic support payment and threshold payment__ 

            In computing the maximum payment amount under paragraph (1)(C) or subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, and the learning opportunity threshold payment under subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), as the case may be, for an administrative school district described in subparagraph (A)—

                (i) the Secretary shall first determine the maximum payment amount and the total current expenditures for the State as a whole; and

                (ii)

                 the Secretary shall then—

                    (I) proportionately allocate such maximum payment amount among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective weighted student units of such districts; and

                    (II) proportionately allocate such total current expenditures among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective number of students in average daily attendance at such districts.

        (5) __Local educational agencies affected by removal of Federal property__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In computing the amount of a basic support payment under this subsection for a fiscal year for a local educational agency described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall meet the additional requirements described in subparagraph (C).

            (B) __Local educational agency described__ 

                A local educational agency described in this subparagraph is a local educational agency with respect to which Federal property (i) located within the boundaries of the agency, and (ii) on which one or more children reside who are receiving a free public education at a school of the agency, is transferred by the Federal Government to another entity in any fiscal year beginning on or after October 30, 2000, so that the property is subject to taxation by the State or a political subdivision of the State.

            (C) __Additional requirements__ 

            The additional requirements described in this subparagraph are the following:
