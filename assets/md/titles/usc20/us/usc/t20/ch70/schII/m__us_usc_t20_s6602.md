    The term “State authorizer” means an entity designated by the Governor of a State to recognize teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academies within the State that—

        (A) enters into an agreement with a teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academy that specifies the goals expected of the academy, as described in paragraph (4)(A)(i);

        (B) may be a nonprofit organization, State educational agency, or other public entity, or consortium of such entities (including a consortium of States); and

        (C) does not reauthorize a teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academy if the academy fails to produce the minimum number or percentage of effective teachers or principals or other school leaders, respectively (as determined by the State), identified in the academy’s authorizing agreement.

    (4) __Teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academy__ 

    The term “teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academy” means a public or other nonprofit entity, which may be an institution of higher education or an organization affiliated with an institution of higher education, that establishes an academy that will prepare teachers, principals, or other school leaders to serve in high-needs schools, and that—

        (A)

         enters into an agreement with a State authorizer that specifies the goals expected of the academy, including—

            (i) a requirement that prospective teachers, principals, or other school leaders who are enrolled in the academy receive a significant part of their training through clinical preparation that partners the prospective candidate with an effective teacher, principal, or other school leader, as determined by the State, respectively, with a demonstrated record of increasing student academic achievement, including for the subgroups of students defined in [section 6311(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6311/c/2], while also receiving concurrent instruction from the academy in the content area (or areas) in which the prospective teacher, principal, or other school leader will become certified or licensed that links to the clinical preparation experience;

            (ii) the number of effective teachers, principals, or other school leaders, respectively, who will demonstrate success in increasing student academic achievement that the academy will prepare; and

            (iii) a requirement that the academy will award a certificate of completion (or degree, if the academy is, or is affiliated with, an institution of higher education) to a teacher only after the teacher demonstrates that the teacher is an effective teacher, as determined by the State, with a demonstrated record of increasing student academic achievement either as a student teacher or teacher-of-record on an alternative certificate, license, or credential;

            (iv) a requirement that the academy will award a certificate of completion (or degree, if the academy is, or is affiliated with, an institution of higher education) to a principal or other school leader only after the principal or other school leader demonstrates a record of success in improving student performance; and

            (iii) restrictions related to the number of course credits required as part of the program of study;

            (iv) restrictions related to the undergraduate coursework completed by teachers teaching or working on alternative certificates, licenses, or credentials, as long as such teachers have successfully passed all relevant State-approved content area examinations; or

            (v) restrictions related to obtaining accreditation from an accrediting body for purposes of becoming an academy;

        (C) limits admission to its program to prospective teacher, principal, or other school leader candidates who demonstrate strong potential to improve student academic achievement, based on a rigorous selection process that reviews a candidate’s prior academic achievement or record of professional accomplishment; and

        (D) results in a certificate of completion or degree that the State may, after reviewing the academy’s results in producing effective teachers, or principals, or other school leaders, respectively (as determined by the State) recognize as at least the equivalent of a master’s degree in education for the purposes of hiring, retention, compensation, and promotion in the State.
