    (b) __Federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A State educational agency or local educational agency shall use Federal funds received under this part only to supplement the funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.

        (2) __Special rule__ 

            No local educational agency shall be required to provide services under this part through a particular instructional method or in a particular instructional setting in order to demonstrate such agency’s compliance with paragraph (1).

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Comparable services__ 

                Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5), a local educational agency may receive funds under this part only if State and local funds will be used in schools served under this part to provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least comparable to services in schools that are not receiving funds under this part.

            (B) __Substantially comparable services__ 

                If the local educational agency is serving all of such agency’s schools under this part, such agency may receive funds under this part only if such agency will use State and local funds to provide services that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in each school.

            (C) __Basis__ 

                A local educational agency may meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) on a grade-span by grade-span basis or a school-by-school basis.

        (2) __Written assurance__ 

            (A) __Equivalence__ 

            A local educational agency shall be considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (1) if such agency has filed with the State educational agency a written assurance that such agency has established and implemented—

                (i) a local educational agency-wide salary schedule;

                (ii) a policy to ensure equivalence among schools in teachers, administrators, and other staff; and

                (iii) a policy to ensure equivalence among schools in the provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies.

            (B) __Determinations__ 

                For the purpose of this subsection, in the determination of expenditures per pupil from State and local funds, or instructional salaries per pupil from State and local funds, staff salary differentials for years of employment shall not be included in such determinations.

            (C) __Exclusions__ 

                A local educational agency need not include unpredictable changes in student enrollment or personnel assignments that occur after the beginning of a school year in determining comparability of services under this subsection.

        (3) __Procedures and records__ 

        Each local educational agency assisted under this part shall—

            (A) develop procedures for compliance with this subsection; and

            (B) maintain records that are updated biennially documenting such agency’s compliance with this subsection.
