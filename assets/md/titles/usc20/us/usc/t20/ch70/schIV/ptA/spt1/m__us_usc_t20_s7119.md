([Pub. L. 89–10, title IV][/us/pl/89/10/tIV], § 4109, as added [Pub. L. 114–95, title IV][/us/pl/114/95/tIV], § 4101, Dec. 10, 2015, [129 Stat. 1981][/us/stat/129/1981].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 7115(a) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7115/a], referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “section 4015(a)”, and was translated as meaning section 4105(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, [Pub. L. 89–10][/us/pl/89/10], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because that Act does not contain a section 4015 and section 4105(a) refers to allocations.

 __Effective Date__ 

    Section effective Dec. 10, 2015, except with respect to certain noncompetitive programs and competitive programs, see [section 5 of Pub. L. 114–95][/us/pl/114/95/s5], set out as an Effective Date of 2015 Amendment note under [section 6301 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6301].
