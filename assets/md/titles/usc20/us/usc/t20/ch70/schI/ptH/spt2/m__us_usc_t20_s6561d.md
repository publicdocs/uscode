## § 6561d. Strategies and capacity building

Each local educational agency receiving a grant or subgrant under this subpart and each State educational agency receiving a grant under this subpart shall implement scientifically based, sustainable, and widely replicated strategies for school dropout prevention and reentry. The strategies may include—

     specific strategies for targeted purposes, such as—

        (A) effective early intervention programs designed to identify at-risk students;

        (B) effective programs serving at-risk students, including racial and ethnic minorities and pregnant and parenting teenagers, designed to prevent such students from dropping out of school; and

        (C) effective programs to identify and encourage youth who have already dropped out of school to reenter school and complete their secondary education; and

    (2) approaches such as breaking larger schools down into smaller learning communities and other comprehensive reform approaches, creating alternative school programs, and developing clear linkages to career skills and employment.
