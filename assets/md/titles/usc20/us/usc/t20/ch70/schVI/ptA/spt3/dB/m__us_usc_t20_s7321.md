    [Section 7321a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7321a], referred to in subsec. (e)(1)(B), was in the original “section 6251”, meaning [section 6251 of Pub. L. 89–10][/us/pl/89/10/s6251], which was translated as reading section 6152 of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because that Act does not contain a section 6251, and section 6152 of that Act describes programs.
