## § 7710. Federal administration

    (a) __Payments in whole dollar amounts__ 

        The Secretary shall round any payments under this subchapter to the nearest whole dollar amount.

    (b) __Other agencies__ 

        Each Federal agency administering Federal property on which children reside, and each agency principally responsible for an activity that may occasion assistance under this subchapter, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, comply with requests of the Secretary for information the Secretary may require to carry out this subchapter.

    (c) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __Certain children eligible under subparagraphs (A) and (G)(ii) of section 7703(a)(1)__ 

            (A) The Secretary shall treat as eligible under subparagraph (A) of [section 7703(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7703/a/1] any child who would be eligible under such subparagraph except that the Federal property on which the child resides or on which the child’s parent is employed is not in the same State in which the child attends school, if such child meets the requirements of paragraph (2).

            (B) The Secretary shall treat as eligible under subparagraph (G) of [section 7703(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7703/a/1] any child who would be eligible under such subparagraph except that such child does not meet the requirements of clause (ii) of such subparagraph, if such child meets the requirements of paragraph (2).

        (2) __Requirements__ 

        A child meets the requirements of this paragraph if—

            (A)

             such child resides—

                (i) in a State adjacent to the State in which the local educational agency serving the school such child attends is located; or

                (ii) with a parent employed on Federal property in a State adjacent to the State in which such agency is located;

            (B) the schools of such agency are within a more reasonable commuting distance of such child’s home than the schools of the local educational agency that serves the school attendance area where such child resides;

            (C) attending the schools of the local educational agency that serves the school attendance area where such child resides will impose a substantial hardship on such child;

            (D) the State in which such child attends school provides funds for the education of such child on the same basis as all other public school children in the State, unless otherwise permitted under [section 7709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7709/b]; and

            (E) such agency received a payment for fiscal year 1999 under [section 7703(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7703/b] on behalf of children described in paragraph (1).

    (d) __Timely payments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall pay a local educational agency the full amount that the agency is eligible to receive under this subchapter for a fiscal year not later than September 30 of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which such amount has been appropriated if, not later than 1 calendar year following the fiscal year in which such amount has been appropriated, such local educational agency submits to the Secretary all the data and information necessary for the Secretary to pay the full amount that the agency is eligible to receive under this subchapter for such fiscal year.

        (2) __Payments with respect of fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated__ 

            For a fiscal year in which the amount appropriated under [section 7714 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7714] is insufficient to pay the full amount a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this subchapter, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “is available to pay the agency” for “the agency is eligible to receive” each place the term appears.
