                        Subject to the authority and requirements for the individualized education program team for a child with a disability under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ([20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb)][/us/usc/t20/s1414/d/1/A/i/VI/bb]), such team, consistent with the guidelines established by the State and required under section 612(a)(16)(C) of such Act ([20 U.S.C. 1412(c)(16)(C)][/us/usc/t20/s1412/c/16/C])  <sup>\[5\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 5 So in original. Probably should be “([20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(C)][/us/usc/t20/s1412/a/16/C])”. </sup></sup>  and clause (i)(II) of this subparagraph, shall determine when a child with a significant cognitive disability shall participate in an alternate assessment aligned with the alternate academic achievement standards.

                    (II) __Prohibition on local cap__ 

                        Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit the Secretary or a State educational agency to impose on any local educational agency a cap on the percentage of students administered an alternate assessment under this subparagraph, except that a local educational agency exceeding the cap applied to the State under clause (i)(I) shall submit information to the State educational agency justifying the need to exceed such cap.

                    (III) __State support__ 

                        A State shall provide appropriate oversight, as determined by the State, of any local educational agency that is required to submit information to the State under subclause (II).

                    (IV) __Waiver authority__ 

                        This subparagraph shall be subject to the waiver authority under [section 7861 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7861].

            (E) __State authority__ 

            If a State educational agency provides evidence, which is satisfactory to the Secretary, that neither the State educational agency nor any other State government official, agency, or entity has sufficient authority, under State law, to adopt challenging State academic standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which will be applicable to all students enrolled in the State’s public elementary schools and secondary schools, then the State educational agency may meet the requirements of this subsection by—

                (i) adopting academic standards and academic assessments that meet the requirements of this subsection, on a statewide basis, and limiting their applicability to students served under this part; or

                (ii)

                 adopting and implementing policies that ensure that each local educational agency in the State that receives grants under this part will adopt academic content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which—

                (ii) __Secretarial assistance__ 

                    The State shall make every effort to develop such assessments and may request assistance from the Secretary if linguistically accessible academic assessment measures are needed. Upon request, the Secretary shall assist with the identification of appropriate academic assessment measures in the needed languages, but shall not mandate a specific academic assessment or mode of instruction.

            (G) __Assessments of English language proficiency__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each State plan shall demonstrate that local educational agencies in the State will provide for an annual assessment of English proficiency of all English learners in the schools served by the State educational agency.

                (ii) __Alignment__ 

                    The assessments described in clause (i) shall be aligned with the State’s English language proficiency standards described in paragraph (1)(F).

            (H) __Locally-selected assessment__

                    Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a local educational agency from administering a locally-selected assessment in lieu of the State-designed academic assessment under subclause (I)(bb) and subclause (II)(cc) of subparagraph (B)(v), if the local educational agency selects a nationally-recognized high school academic assessment that has been approved for use by the State as described in clause (iii) or (iv) of this subparagraph.

                (ii) __State technical criteria__ 

                    To allow for State approval of nationally-recognized high school academic assessments that are available for local selection under clause (i), a State educational agency shall establish technical criteria to determine if any such assessment meets the requirements of clause (v).

                (iii) __State approval__ 

                If a State educational agency chooses to make a nationally-recognized high school assessment available for selection by a local educational agency under clause (i), which has not already been approved under this clause, such State educational agency shall—

                    (I) conduct a review of the assessment to determine if such assessment meets or exceeds the technical criteria established by the State educational agency under clause (ii);

                    (II) submit evidence in accordance with subsection (a)(4) that demonstrates such assessment meets the requirements of clause (v); and

                    (III) after fulfilling the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II), approve such assessment for selection and use by any local educational agency that requests to use such assessment under clause (i).

                (iv) __Local educational agency option__ 

                    (I) __Local educational agency__ 

                        If a local educational agency chooses to submit a nationally-recognized high school academic assessment to the State educational agency, subject to the approval process described in subclause (I) and subclause (II) of clause (iii) to determine if such assessment fulfills the requirements of clause (v), the State educational agency may approve the use of such assessment consistent with clause (i).

                    (II) __State educational agency__ 

                        Upon such approval, the State educational agency shall approve the use of such assessment in any other local educational agency in the State that subsequently requests to use such assessment without repeating the process described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (iii).

                (v) __Requirements__ 

                To receive approval from the State educational agency under clause (iii), a locally-selected assessment shall—

                    (I) be aligned to the State’s academic content standards under paragraph (1), address the depth and breadth of such standards, and be equivalent in its content coverage, difficulty, and quality to the State-designed assessments under this paragraph (and may be more rigorous in its content coverage and difficulty than such State-designed assessments);

                    (II) provide comparable, valid, and reliable data on academic achievement, as compared to the State-designed assessments, for all students and for each subgroup of students defined in subsection (c)(2), with results expressed in terms consistent with the State’s academic achievement standards under paragraph (1), among all local educational agencies within the State;

                    (III) meet the requirements for the assessments under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, including technical criteria, except the requirement under clause (i) of such subparagraph; and

            (I) __Deferral__ 

                A State may defer the commencement, or suspend the administration, but not cease the development, of the assessments described in this paragraph, for 1 year for each year for which the amount appropriated for grants under part B is less than $369,100,000.

            (J) __Adaptive assessments__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Subject to clause (ii), a State retains the right to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments as the assessments described in this paragraph, provided the computer adaptive assessments meet the requirements of this paragraph, except that—

                    (I) subparagraph (B)(i) shall not be interpreted to require that all students taking the computer adaptive assessment be administered the same assessment items; and

                    (II)

                     such assessment—

                        (aa) shall measure, at a minimum, each student’s academic proficiency based on the challenging State academic standards for the student’s grade level and growth toward such standards; and

                        (bb) may measure the student’s level of academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student’s grade level, including for use as part of a State’s accountability system under subsection (c).

                (ii) __Students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and English learners__ 

                In developing and administering computer adaptive assessments—

            (A)

             with respect to any provisions under this part that require disaggregation of information by each subgroup of students—

                (i) the minimum number of students that the State determines are necessary to be included to carry out such requirements and how that number is statistically sound, which shall be the same State-determined number for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State;

                (ii) how such minimum number of students was determined by the State, including how the State collaborated with teachers, principals, other school leaders, parents, and other stakeholders when determining such minimum number; and

                (iii) how the State ensures that such minimum number is sufficient to not reveal any personally identifiable information.

        (4) __Description of system__ 

        The statewide accountability system described in paragraph (1) shall be based on the challenging State academic standards for reading or language arts and mathematics described in subsection (b)(1) to improve student academic achievement and school success. In designing such system to meet the requirements of this part, the State shall carry out the following:

            (A) __Establishment of long-term goals__

                    (II) for which the term set by the State for such goals is the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State; and

                    (III) that, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measures described in items (aa) and (bb) of subclause (I), take into account the improvement necessary on such measures to make significant progress in closing statewide proficiency and graduation rate gaps; and

                (ii) for English learners, for increases in the percentage of such students making progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline.

            (B) __Indicators__ 

            Except for the indicator described in clause (iv), annually measure, for all students and separately for each subgroup of students, the following indicators:

                (i)

                 For all public schools in the State, based on the long-term goals established under subparagraph (A), academic achievement—

                    (I) as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and

                    (II) at the State’s discretion, for each public high school in the State, student growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

                (ii)

                    (I) in each of the grades 3 through 8; and

                    (II) in the grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I) during the grade 9 through grade 12 period, with such progress being measured against the results of the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G) taken in the previous grade.

                (v)

                    (I)

                     For all public schools in the State, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that—

                 For the purpose of measuring, calculating, and reporting on the indicator described in subparagraph (B)(i), include in the denominator the greater of—

                    (I) 95 percent of all such students, or 95 percent of all such students in the subgroup, as the case may be; or

                    (II) the number of students participating in the assessments.

                (iii) Provide a clear and understandable explanation of how the State will factor the requirement of clause (i) of this subparagraph into the statewide accountability system.

            (F) __Partial attendance__ 

                (i)

                 In the case of a student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year, the performance of such student on the indicators described in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of subparagraph (B)—

                    (I) may not be used in the system of meaningful differentiation of all public schools as described in subparagraph (C) for such school year; and

                    (II) shall be used for the purpose of reporting on the State and local educational agency report cards under subsection (h) for such school year.

                (ii)

                 In the case of a high school student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year and has exited high school without a regular high school diploma and without transferring to another high school that grants a regular high school diploma during such school year, the local educational agency shall, in order to calculate the graduation rate pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), assign such student to the high school—

                    (I) at which such student was enrolled for the greatest proportion of school days while enrolled in grades 9 through 12; or

                    (II) in which the student was most recently enrolled.

                    A local educational agency may provide all students enrolled in a school identified by the State for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i) with the option to transfer to another public school served by the local educational agency, unless such an option is prohibited by State law.

                (ii) __Priority__ 

                    In providing students the option to transfer to another public school, the local educational agency shall give priority to the lowest-achieving children from low-income families, as determined by the local educational agency for the purposes of allocating funds to schools under [section 6313(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6313/a/3].

                (iii) __Treatment__ 

                    A student who uses the option to transfer to another public school shall be enrolled in classes and other activities in the public school to which the student transfers in the same manner as all other students at the public school.

                (iv) __Special rule__ 

                    A local educational agency shall permit a student who transfers to another public school under this paragraph to remain in that school until the student has completed the highest grade in that school.
