## § 6337. Education finance incentive grant program

    (a) __Grants__ 

        From funds appropriated under subsection (f) of this section the Secretary is authorized to make grants to States, from allotments under subsection (b) of this section, to carry out the programs and activities of this part.

    (b) __Distribution based upon fiscal effort and equity__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), funds appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be allotted to each State based upon the number of children counted under [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c] in such State multiplied by the product of—

                (i) the amount in [section 6333(a)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/a/1/B] for all States other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except that the amount determined under that subparagraph shall not be less that 34 percent or more than 46 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States, and the amount in [section 6333(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/a/4] for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except that the amount in [section 6333(a)(4)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/a/4/A/ii] shall be 34 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States; multiplied by

                (ii) such State’s effort factor described in paragraph (2); multiplied by

                (iii) 1.30 minus such State’s equity factor described in paragraph (3).

            (B) __State minimum__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or [section 6332 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6332], from the total amount available for any fiscal year to carry out this section, each State shall be allotted at least the lesser of—

                (i) 0.35 percent of total appropriations; or

                (ii)

                 the average of—

                    (I) 0.35 percent of the total amount available to carry out this section; and

                    (II) 150 percent of the national average grant under this section per child described in [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c], without application of a weighting factor, multiplied by the State’s total number of children described in [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c], without application of a weighting factor.

        (2) __Effort factor__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the effort factor for a State shall be determined in accordance with the succeeding sentence, except that such factor shall not be less than 0.95 nor greater than 1.05. The effort factor determined under this sentence shall be a fraction the numerator of which is the product of the 3-year average per-pupil expenditure in the State multiplied by the 3-year average per capita income in the United States and the denominator of which is the product of the 3-year average per capita income in such State multiplied by the 3-year average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.

            (B) __Commonwealth of Puerto Rico__ 

                The effort factor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be equal to the lowest effort factor calculated under subparagraph (A) for any State.

        (3) __Equity factor__ 

            (A) __Determination__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the equity factor under this section for each State in accordance with clause (ii).

                (ii) __Computation__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        For each State, the Secretary shall compute a weighted coefficient of variation for the per-pupil expenditures of local educational agencies in accordance with subclauses (II), (III), and (IV).

                    (II) __Variation__ 

                        In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall weigh the variation between per-pupil expenditures in each local educational agency and the average per-pupil expenditures in the State according to the number of pupils served by the local educational agency.

                    (III) __Number of pupils__ 

                        In determining the number of pupils under this paragraph served by each local educational agency and in each State, the Secretary shall multiply the number of children counted under [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c] by a factor of 1.4.

                    (IV) __Enrollment requirement__ 

                        In computing coefficients of variation, the Secretary shall include only those local educational agencies with an enrollment of more than 200 students.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

                The equity factor for a State that meets the disparity standard described in section 222.162 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations (as such section was in effect on the day preceding January 8, 2002) or a State with only one local educational agency shall be not greater than 0.10.

    (c) __Use of funds; eligibility of local educational agencies__ 

    All funds awarded to each State under this section shall be allocated to local educational agencies under the following provisions. Within local educational agencies, funds allocated under this section shall be distributed to schools on a basis consistent with [section 6313 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6313], and may only be used to carry out activities under this part. A local educational agency in a State is eligible to receive a targeted grant under this section for any fiscal year if—

        (A) the number of children in the local educational agency counted under [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c], before application of the weighted child count described in paragraph (3), is at least 10; and

        (B) if the number of children counted for grants under [section 6333(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333/c], before application of the weighted child count described in paragraph (3), is at least 5 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the school district of the local educational agency.

        For any fiscal year for which the Secretary allocates funds under this section on the basis of counties, funds made available as a result of applying this subsection shall be reallocated by the State educational agency to other eligible local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the distribution of other funds under this section.

    (d) __Allocation of funds to eligible local educational agencies__ 

    Funds received by States under this section shall be allocated within States to eligible local educational agencies on the basis of weighted child counts calculated in accordance with paragraph (1), (2), or (3), as appropriate for each State.

        (1) __States with an equity factor less than .10__ 

        In States with an equity factor less than .10, the weighted child counts referred to in subsection (d) of this section shall be calculated as follows:

            (A) __Weights for allocations to counties__ 

                (i) __In general__
