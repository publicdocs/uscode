        (2) in other low-incidence languages in the United States for which instruction materials are not readily available.

    (b) __Priority__ 

    In making the grants, the Secretary shall give priority to applicants for the grants who propose—

        (1) to develop instruction materials in languages indigenous to the United States or the outlying areas; and
