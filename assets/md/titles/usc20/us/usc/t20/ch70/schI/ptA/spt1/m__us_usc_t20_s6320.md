        (5) __Documentation__ 

            Each local educational agency shall maintain in the agency’s records and provide to the State educational agency involved a written affirmation signed by officials of each participating private school that the meaningful consultation required by this section has occurred. The written affirmation shall provide the option for private school officials to indicate such officials’ belief that timely and meaningful consultation has not occurred or that the program design is not equitable with respect to eligible private school children. If such officials do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the local educational agency shall forward the documentation that such consultation has, or attempts at such consultation have, taken place to the State educational agency.

            (B) __Procedure__ 

                If the private school official wishes to file a complaint, the official shall provide the basis of the noncompliance with this section by the local educational agency to the State educational agency, and the local educational agency shall forward the appropriate documentation to the State educational agency.

            (C) __State educational agencies__ 

            A State educational agency shall provide services under this section directly or through contracts with public or private agencies, organizations, or institutions, if the appropriate private school officials have—

                (ii) demonstrated that the local educational agency involved has not met the requirements of this section in accordance with the procedures for making such a request, as prescribed by the State educational agency.

    (c) __Allocation for equitable service to private school students__ 

        (1) __Calculation__ 

        A local educational agency shall have the final authority, consistent with this section, to calculate the number of children, ages 5 through 17, who are from low-income families and attend private schools by—

            (A) using the same measure of low income used to count public school children;

            (B) using the results of a survey that, to the extent possible, protects the identity of families of private school students, and allowing such survey results to be extrapolated if complete actual data are unavailable;

            (C) applying the low-income percentage of each participating public school attendance area, determined pursuant to this section, to the number of private school children who reside in that school attendance area; or

            (D) using an equated measure of low income correlated with the measure of low income used to count public school children.

        (2) __Complaint process__ 

            Any dispute regarding low-income data for private school students shall be subject to the complaint process authorized in [section 7883 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7883].

    (d) __Public control of funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The control of funds provided under this part, and title to materials, equipment, and property purchased with such funds, shall be in a public agency, and a public agency shall administer such funds, materials, equipment, and property.

        (2) __Provision of services__ 

            (A) __Provider__ 

            The provision of services under this section shall be provided—

                (i) by employees of a public agency; or

                (ii) through contract by such public agency with an individual, association, agency, or organization.

            (B) __Requirement__ 

                In the provision of such services, such employee, individual, association, agency, or organization shall be independent of such private school and of any religious organization, and such employment or contract shall be under the control and supervision of such public agency.

    (e) __Standards for a bypass__ 

    If a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing for the participation in programs on an equitable basis of eligible children enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools, or if the Secretary determines that a local educational agency has substantially failed or is unwilling, to provide for such participation, as required by this section, the Secretary shall—

        (1) waive the requirements of this section for such local educational agency;

        (2) arrange for the provision of services to such children through arrangements that shall be subject to the requirements of this section and sections 7883 and 7884 of this title; and

        (3) in making the determination under this subsection, consider one or more factors, including the quality, size, scope, and location of the program and the opportunity of eligible children to participate.
