    The term “innovative assessment system” means a system of assessments that may include—

        (1) competency-based assessments, instructionally embedded assessments, interim assessments, cumulative year-end assessments, or performance-based assessments that combine into an annual summative determination for a student, which may be administered through computer adaptive assessments; and

        (2) assessments that validate when students are ready to demonstrate mastery or proficiency and allow for differentiated student support based on individual learning needs.

    (b) __Demonstration authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may provide a State educational agency, or a consortium of State educational agencies, in accordance with paragraph (3), with the authority to establish an innovative assessment system (referred to in this section as “demonstration authority”).

        (2) __Demonstration period__ 

            In accordance with the requirements described in subsection (e), each State educational agency, or consortium of State educational agencies, that submits an application under this section shall propose in its application the period of time over which the State educational agency or consortium desires to exercise the demonstration authority, except that such period shall not exceed 5 years.

        (3) __Initial demonstration authority and expansion__ 

        During the first 3 years that the Secretary provides State educational agencies and consortia with demonstration authority (referred to in this section as the “initial demonstration period”) the Secretary shall provide such demonstration authority to—
