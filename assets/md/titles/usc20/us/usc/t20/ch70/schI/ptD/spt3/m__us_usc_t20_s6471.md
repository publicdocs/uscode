## § 6471. Program evaluations

    (a) __Scope of evaluation__ 

    Each State agency or local educational agency that conducts a program under subpart 1 or 2 of this part shall evaluate the program, disaggregating data on participation by gender, race, ethnicity, and age, not less than once every 3 years, to determine the program’s impact on the ability of participants—

        (1) to maintain and improve educational achievement;

        (2) to accrue school credits that meet State requirements for grade promotion and secondary school graduation;

        (3) to make the transition to a regular program or other education program operated by a local educational agency;

        (4) to complete secondary school (or secondary school equivalency requirements) and obtain employment after leaving the correctional facility or institution for neglected or delinquent children and youth; and

        (5) as appropriate, to participate in postsecondary education and job training programs.

    (b) __Exception__ 

        The disaggregation required under subsection (a) of this section shall not be required in a case in which the number of students in a category is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student.

    (c) __Evaluation measures__ 

        In conducting each evaluation under subsection (a) of this section, a State agency or local educational agency shall use multiple and appropriate measures of student progress.

    (d) __Evaluation results__ 

    Each State agency and local educational agency shall—

        (1) submit evaluation results to the State educational agency and the Secretary; and

        (2) use the results of evaluations under this section to plan and improve subsequent programs for participating children and youth.
