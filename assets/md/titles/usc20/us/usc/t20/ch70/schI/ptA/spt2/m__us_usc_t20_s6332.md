        (1) an amount equal to the amount made available to carry out [section 6333 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333] for fiscal year 2001 shall be allocated in accordance with [section 6333 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333];

        (3) an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount, if any, by which the total amount made available under this subsection for the current fiscal year for which the determination is made exceeds the total amount available to carry out sections 6333 and 6334 of this title for fiscal year 2001 shall be used to carry out sections 6335 and 6337 of this title and such amount shall be divided equally between sections 6335 and 6337 of this title.

    (b) __Adjustments where necessitated by appropriations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the sums available under this subpart for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that all local educational agencies in States are eligible to receive under sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce the allocations to such local educational agencies, subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section.

        (2) __Additional funds__ 

            If additional funds become available for making payments under sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title for such fiscal year, allocations that were reduced under paragraph (1) shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.

    (c) __Hold-harmless amounts__ 

        (1) __Amounts for sections 6333, 6334, and 6335__ 

        For each fiscal year, the amount made available to each local educational agency under each of sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title shall be—

            (A) not less than 95 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the number of children counted for grants under [section 6333 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6333] is not less than 30 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the local educational agency;

        (2) __Payments__ 

            If sufficient funds are appropriated, the amounts described in paragraph (1) shall be paid to all local educational agencies that received grants under [section 6334 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6334] for the preceding fiscal year, regardless of whether the local educational agency meets the minimum eligibility criteria for that fiscal year described in [section 6334(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6334/a/1/A] except that a local educational agency that does not meet such minimum eligibility criteria for 4 consecutive years shall no longer be eligible to receive a hold harmless amount referred to in paragraph (1).

        (3) __Applicability__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not take into consideration the hold-harmless provisions of this subsection for any fiscal year for purposes of calculating State or local allocations for the fiscal year under any program administered by the Secretary other than a program authorized under this part.

        (4) __Population data__ 

            For any fiscal year for which the Secretary calculates grants on the basis of population data for counties, the Secretary shall apply the hold-harmless percentages in paragraphs (1) and (2) to counties and, if the Secretary’s allocation for a county is not sufficient to meet the hold-harmless requirements of this subsection for every local educational agency within that county, the State educational agency shall reallocate funds proportionately from all other local educational agencies in the State that are receiving funds in excess of the hold-harmless amounts specified in this subsection.

    (d) __Ratable reductions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the sums made available under this subpart for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that local educational agencies in all States are eligible to receive under subsection (c) of this section for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce such amounts for such year.

        (2) __Additional funds__ 

            If additional funds become available for making payments under subsection (c) of this section for such fiscal year, amounts that were reduced under paragraph (1) shall be increased on the same basis as such amounts were reduced.
