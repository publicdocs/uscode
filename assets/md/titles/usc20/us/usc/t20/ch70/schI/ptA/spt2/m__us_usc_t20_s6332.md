            If sufficient funds are appropriated, the amounts described in paragraph (1) shall be paid to all local educational agencies that received grants under [section 6334 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6334] for the preceding fiscal year, regardless of whether the local educational agency meets the minimum eligibility criteria for that fiscal year described in [section 6334(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6334/a/1/A] except that a local educational agency that does not meet such minimum eligibility criteria for 4 consecutive years shall no longer be eligible to receive a hold harmless amount referred to in paragraph (1).

        (3) __Applicability__

        (4) __Population data__ 

            For any fiscal year for which the Secretary calculates grants on the basis of population data for counties, the Secretary shall apply the hold-harmless percentages in paragraphs (1) and (2) to counties and, if the Secretary’s allocation for a county is not sufficient to meet the hold-harmless requirements of this subsection for every local educational agency within that county, the State educational agency shall reallocate funds proportionately from all other local educational agencies in the State that are receiving funds in excess of the hold-harmless amounts specified in this subsection.

    (d) __Ratable reductions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the sums made available under this subpart for any fiscal year are insufficient to pay the full amounts that local educational agencies in all States are eligible to receive under subsection (c) of this section for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce such amounts for such year.

        (2) __Additional funds__ 

            If additional funds become available for making payments under subsection (c) of this section for such fiscal year, amounts that were reduced under paragraph (1) shall be increased on the same basis as such amounts were reduced.
