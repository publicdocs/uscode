    (a) __Achievement objectives__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each State educational agency or specially qualified agency receiving a grant under subpart 1 of this part shall develop annual measurable achievement objectives for limited English proficient children served under this part that relate to such children’s development and attainment of English proficiency while meeting challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards as required by [section 6311(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6311/b/1].

                (i) at a minimum, annual increases in the number or percentage of children making progress in learning English;

                (ii) at a minimum, annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining English proficiency by the end of each school year, as determined by a valid and reliable assessment of English proficiency consistent with [section 6311(b)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6311/b/7]; and

                (iii) making adequate yearly progress for limited English proficient children as described in [section 6311(b)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6311/b/2/B]; and

                (i) has experienced a large increase in limited English proficient children or immigrant children and youth;

                (ii) enrolls a statistically significant number of immigrant children and youth from countries where such children and youth had little or no access to formal education; or

        (2) __Improvement plan__ 

            If a State educational agency determines, based on the annual measurable achievement objectives described in subsection (a) of this section, that an eligible entity has failed to make progress toward meeting such objectives for 2 consecutive years, the agency shall require the entity to develop an improvement plan that will ensure that the entity meets such objectives. The improvement plan shall specifically address the factors that prevented the entity from achieving such objectives.

            (D) require such entity to utilize such strategies and activities; and

        (4) __Accountability__ 

        If a State educational agency determines that an eligible entity has failed to meet the annual measurable achievement objectives described in subsection (a) of this section for 4 consecutive years, the agency shall—

            (A) require such entity to modify the entity’s curriculum, program, and method of instruction; or

            (B)
