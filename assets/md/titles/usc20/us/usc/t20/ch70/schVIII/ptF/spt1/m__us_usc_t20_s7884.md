            (A) __Written objections__ 

                The Secretary shall not take any final action under [section 7882 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7882] until the State educational agency, local educational agency, educational service agency, consortium of those agencies, or entity affected by the action has had an opportunity, for not less than 45 days after receiving written notice thereof, to submit written objections and to appear before the Secretary to show cause why that action should not be taken.

            (B) __Prior to reduction__ 

                Pending final resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a determination under this section, the Secretary may withhold from the allocation of the affected State educational agency or local educational agency the amount estimated by the Secretary to be necessary to pay the cost of those services.

        (2) __Petition for review__ 

            (A) __Petition__ 

                If the affected agency, consortium, or entity is dissatisfied with the Secretary’s final action after a proceeding under paragraph (1), the agency, consortium, or entity may, within 60 days after notice of that action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State is located a petition for review of that action.

            (B) __Transmission__ 

                A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary.

        (3) __Findings of fact__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary to take further evidence and the Secretary may then make new or modified findings of fact and may modify the Secretary’s previous action, and shall file in the court the record of the further proceedings.

            (B) __New or modified findings__ 

                Any new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

        (4) __Jurisdiction__

    (b) __Determination__ 

        Any determination by the Secretary under this section shall continue in effect until the Secretary determines, in consultation with that agency, consortium, or entity and representatives of the affected private school children, teachers, or other educational personnel, that there will no longer be any failure or inability on the part of the agency, consortium, or entity to meet the applicable requirements of [section 7881 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s7881] or any other provision of this chapter.
