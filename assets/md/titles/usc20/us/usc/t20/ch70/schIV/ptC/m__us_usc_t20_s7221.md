## § 7221. Purpose

    It is the purpose of this part to—

    (1) improve the United States education system and education opportunities for all people in the United States by supporting innovation in public education in public school settings that prepare students to compete and contribute to the global economy and a stronger Nation;

    (2) provide financial assistance for the planning, program design, and initial implementation of charter schools;

    (3) increase the number of high-quality charter schools available to students across the United States;

    (4) evaluate the impact of charter schools on student achievement, families, and communities, and share best practices between charter schools and other public schools;

    (5) encourage States to provide support to charter schools for facilities financing in an amount more nearly commensurate to the amount States typically provide for traditional public schools;

    (6) expand opportunities for children with disabilities, English learners, and other traditionally underserved students to attend charter schools and meet the challenging State academic standards;

    (7) support efforts to strengthen the charter school authorizing process to improve performance management, including transparency, oversight and monitoring (including financial audits), and evaluation of such schools; and

    (8) support quality, accountability, and transparency in the operational performance of all authorized public chartering agencies, including State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and other authorizing entities.
