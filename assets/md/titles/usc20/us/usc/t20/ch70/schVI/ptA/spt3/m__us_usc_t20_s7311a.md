## § 7311a. Purpose

The purpose of this subpart is to create options for selected State educational agencies and local educational agencies—

    (1) to improve the academic achievement of all students, and to focus the resources of the Federal Government upon such achievement;

    (2) to improve teacher quality and subject matter mastery, especially in mathematics, reading, and science;

    (3) to better empower parents, educators, administrators, and schools to effectively address the needs of their children and students;

    (4) to give participating State educational agencies and local educational agencies greater flexibility in determining how to increase their students’ academic achievement and implement education reforms in their schools;

    (5) to eliminate barriers to implementing effective State and local education reform, while preserving the goals of opportunity for all students and accountability for student progress;

    (6) to hold participating State educational agencies and local educational agencies accountable for increasing the academic achievement of all students, especially disadvantaged students; and

    (7) to narrow achievement gaps between the lowest and highest achieving groups of students so that no child is left behind.
