        (B) monitor properly any subgrantee under the applicable program or programs;

    (2)

     review and analyze the results of monitoring and compliance reviews—

    (3) publicly report the work undertaken by the Secretary to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to such taxpayer funds; and

    (4) work with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education, as needed, to help ensure that employees of the Department understand how to adequately monitor grantees and to help grantees adequately monitor any subgrantees.
