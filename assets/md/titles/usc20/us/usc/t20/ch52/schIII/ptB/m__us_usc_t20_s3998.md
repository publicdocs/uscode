 __References in Text__ 

    The Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, referred to in subsec.

L. 97–35][/us/pl/97/35], Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 463][/us/stat/95/463], as amended. Chapter 1 of the Act was classified generally to subchapter I (§ 3801 et seq.) of chapter 51 of this title, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 100–297, title I][/us/pl/100/297/tI], § 1003(a), Apr. 28, 1988, [102 Stat. 293][/us/stat/102/293]. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.
