    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on and after August 2, 2002, for purposes of [section 501 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s501] (relating to Federal sources of supply, including lodging providers, airlines and other transportation providers), the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program shall be deemed an executive agency for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of [section 5201 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s5201], and the employees of and participants in the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program shall be eligible to have access to such sources of supply on the same basis as employees of an executive agency have such access.

 __Codification__ 

    “[Section 501 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s501]” substituted for “section 201(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949” on authority of [Pub.
