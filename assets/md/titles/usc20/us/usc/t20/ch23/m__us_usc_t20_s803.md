        (2) supporting State and local research that is needed in connection with housing programs and needs, public improvement programing, code problems, efficient land use, urban transportation, and similar community development problems, and collecting, collating, and publishing statistics and information relating to such research.

    (b) __Training in housing management__ 

        Grants may be made under subsection (a) of this section to support (1) the training of persons, especially persons of low income, in acquiring the skills needed in the management of housing for low- and moderate-income persons, and (2) research and the dissemination of information with respect to the problems involved in the management of housing for low- and moderate-income persons.
