## § 1078–3. Federal consolidation loans

    (a) __Agreements with eligible lenders__ 

        (1) __Agreement required for insurance coverage__ 

        For the purpose of providing loans to eligible borrowers for consolidation of their obligations with respect to eligible student loans, the Secretary or a guaranty agency shall enter into agreements in accordance with subsection (b) of this section with the following eligible lenders:

        (2) __Insurance coverage of consolidation loans__ 

            Except as provided in [section 1079(e) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1079/e], no contract of insurance under this part shall apply to a consolidation loan unless such loan is made under an agreement pursuant to this section and is covered by a certificate issued in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section. Loans covered by such a certificate that is issued by a guaranty agency shall be considered to be insured loans for the purposes of reimbursements under [section 1078(c) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/c], but no payment shall be made with respect to such loans under [section 1078(f) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/f] to any such agency.

                        (aa) for the purposes of obtaining income contingent repayment or income-based repayment, and only if the loan has been submitted to the guaranty agency for default aversion or if the loan is already in default;

        For the purpose of paragraph (1), the term “eligible student loans” means loans—

            (A) made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, and first disbursed before July 1, 2010, including loans on which the borrower has defaulted (but has made arrangements to repay the obligation on the defaulted loans satisfactory to the Secretary or guaranty agency, whichever insured the loans);

                    (III) the occupations listed in [section 1087ee of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087ee] that qualify for Federal Perkins Loan cancellation under [section 1087ee(a) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087ee/a];

The guaranty agency may issue a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage to a lender with which it has an agreement under such paragraph. The Secretary shall not issue a certificate to a lender described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section unless the Secretary determines that such lender has first applied to, and has been denied a certificate of insurance by, the guaranty agency which insures the preponderance of its loans (by value).

        (3) __Contents of certificate__ 

        A certificate issued under paragraph (2) shall, at a minimum, provide—

            (A) that all consolidation loans made by such lender in conformity with the requirements of this section will be insured by the Secretary or the guaranty agency (whichever is applicable) against loss of principal and interest;

        (4) __Terms and conditions of loans__ 

        A consolidation loan made pursuant to this section shall be insurable by the Secretary or a guaranty agency pursuant to paragraph (2) only if the loan is made to an eligible borrower who has agreed to notify the holder of the loan promptly concerning any change of address and the loan is evidenced by a note or other written agreement which—

            (A) is made without security and without endorsement, except that if the borrower is a minor and such note or other written agreement executed by him or her would not, under applicable law, create a binding obligation, endorsement may be required;

                    (II) by the Secretary, in the case of a consolidation loan for which the application is received by an eligible lender on or after November 13, 1997, except that the Secretary shall pay such interest only on that portion of the loan that repays Federal Stafford Loans for which the student borrower received an interest subsidy under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078] or Federal Direct Stafford Loans for which the borrower received an interest subsidy under [section 1087e of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087e]; or

In addition, in the event that a borrower chooses to obtain a consolidation loan for the purposes of using the no accrual of interest for active duty service members program offered under section 1087e(o) of this title, the Secretary shall offer a Federal Direct Consolidation loan to any such borrower who applies for participation in such program. A direct consolidation loan offered under this paragraph shall, as requested by the borrower, be repaid either pursuant to income contingent repayment under part C of this subchapter, pursuant to income-based repayment under [section 1098e of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1098e], or pursuant to any other repayment provision under this section, except that if a borrower intends to be eligible to use the public service loan forgiveness program under [section 1087e(m) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087e/m], such loan shall be repaid using one of the repayment options described in [section 1087e(m)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087e/m/1/A]. The Secretary shall not offer such loans if, in the Secretary’s judgment, the Department of Education does not have the necessary origination and servicing arrangements in place for such loans.

        (6) __Nondiscrimination in loan consolidation__

            (C) A consolidation loan made on or after July 1, 1994, and disbursed before July 1, 2010, shall bear interest at an annual rate on the unpaid principal balance of the loan that is equal to the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated, rounded upward to the nearest whole percent.

            (D) A consolidation loan for which the application is received by an eligible lender on or after November 13, 1997, and before October 1, 1998, shall bear interest at an annual rate on the unpaid principal balance of the loan that is equal to the rate specified in [section 1077a(f) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1077a/f], except that the eligible lender may continue to calculate interest on such a loan at the rate previously in effect and defer, until not later than April 1, 1998, the recalculation of the interest on such a loan at the rate required by this subparagraph if the recalculation is applied retroactively to the date on which the loan is made.
