## § 1087–1. Special allowances

    (a) __Findings__ 

        In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.

    (b) __Computation and payment__ 

        (1) __Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance__ 

            A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.

        (2) __Rate of special allowance__ 

            (A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (I) and paragraph (4), the special allowance paid pursuant to this subsection on loans shall be computed (i) by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such 3-month period, (ii) by subtracting the applicable interest rate on such loans from such average, (iii) by adding 3.10 percent to the resultant percent, and (iv) by dividing the resultant percent by 4. If such computation produces a number less than zero, such loans shall be subject to [section 1077a(i) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1077a/i].

            (B)

                (i) The quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations, the income from which is exempt from taxation under title 26 shall be one-half the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), except that, in determining the rate for the purpose of this clause, subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be applied by substituting “3.5 percent” for “3.10 percent”. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interests or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds. This subparagraph shall not apply to loans which were made or insured prior to October 1, 1980.

                (ii) The quarterly rate of the special allowance set under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall not be less than 9.5 percent minus the applicable interest rate on such loans, divided by 4.

                (iii) No special allowance may be paid under this subparagraph unless the issuer of such obligations complies with subsection (d) of this section.

                (iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance for holders of loans which are financed with funds obtained by the holder from the issuance of obligations originally issued on or after October 1, 1993, or refunded after September 30, 2004, the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26, shall be the quarterly rate of the special allowance established under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) as the case may be. Such rate shall also apply to holders of loans which were made or purchased with funds obtained by the holder from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph or from income on the investment of such funds.

                (v)

                 Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance shall be the rate determined under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) of this paragraph, or paragraph (4), as the case may be, for a holder of loans that—

                    (I)

                     were made or purchased with funds—

                        (aa) obtained from the issuance of obligations the income from which is excluded from gross income under title 26 and which obligations were originally issued before October 1, 1993; or

                        (bb) obtained from collections or default reimbursements on, or interest or other income pertaining to, eligible loans made or purchased with funds described in division (aa), or from income on the investment of such funds; and

                    (II)

                     are—

                        (aa) financed by such an obligation that, after September 30, 2004, has matured or been retired or defeased;

                        (bb) refinanced after September 30, 2004, with funds obtained from a source other than funds described in subclause (I) of this clause; or

                        (cc) sold or transferred to any other holder after September 30, 2004.

                (vi)

                 Notwithstanding clauses (i), (ii), and (v), but subject to clause (vii), the quarterly rate of the special allowance shall be the rate determined under subparagraph (A), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (I) of this paragraph, as the case may be, for a holder of loans—

                    (I) that were made or purchased on or after February 8, 2006; or

                    (II) that were not earning a quarterly rate of special allowance determined under clauses (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as of February 8, 2006.

                (vii)

                 Clause (vi) shall be applied by substituting “December 31, 2010” for “February 8, 2006” in the case of a holder of loans that—

                    (I) was, as of February 8, 2006, and during the quarter for which the special allowance is paid, a unit of State or local government or a nonprofit private entity;

                    (II) was, as of February 8, 2006, and during such quarter, not owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, a for-profit entity; and

                            (BB) all loans described in such subclause for which the beneficial owner has the authority to make an election of a waiver under such subclause, regardless of the lender identification number associated with the loan or the lender that holds the loan as eligible lender trustee on behalf of such beneficial owner; and

                            (CC) all future calculations of the special allowance on loans that, on the date of such waiver, are loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB), or that, after such date, become loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB).

                        (bb)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

                        Any waiver pursuant to subclause (II) that is elected for loans described in subitem (AA) or (BB) of item (aa) shall not apply to any loan described in such subitem for which the lender or beneficial owner of the loan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

                            (AA) in accordance with an agreement entered into before the date of enactment of this section by which such lender or owner is governed and that applies to such loans, such lender or owner is not legally permitted to make an election of such waiver with respect to such loans without the approval of one or more third parties with an interest in the loans, and that the lender or owner followed all available options under such agreement to obtain such approval, and was unable to do so; or

                            (BB) such lender or beneficial owner presented the proposal of electing such a waiver applicable to such loans associated with an obligation rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined in [section 78c(a)(62) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/62]), and such rating organization provided a written opinion that the agency would downgrade the rating applicable to such obligation if the lender or owner elected such a waiver.

        (3) __Contractual right of holders to special allowance__ 

            The holder of an eligible loan shall be deemed to have a contractual right against the United States, during the life of such loan, to receive the special allowance according to the provisions of this section. The special allowance determined for any such 3-month period shall be paid promptly after the close of such period, and without administrative delay after receipt of an accurate and complete request for payment, pursuant to procedures established by regulations promulgated under this section.

    (f) __Regulations to prevent denial of loans to eligible students__
