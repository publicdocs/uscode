        (2) __Minimum interval required__ 

            The interval between the first and second such installments shall be not less than one-half of such period of enrollment, except as necessary to permit the second installment to be disbursed at the beginning of the second semester, quarter, or similar division of such period of enrollment.

        (3) __Special rule__ 

            An institution whose cohort default rate (as determined under [section 1085(m) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1085/m]) for each of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data are available is less than 10 percent may disburse any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part in a single installment for any period of enrollment that is not more than 1 semester, 1 trimester, 1 quarter, or 4 months. Notwithstanding section 422(d) of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, this paragraph shall be effective beginning on February 8, 2006.

        (4) __Amendment to special rule__ 

            Beginning on October 1, 2011, the special rule under paragraph (3) shall be applied by substituting “15 percent” for “10 percent”.

    (b) __Disbursement and endorsement requirements__ 

        (1) __First year students__ 

            The first installment of the proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made to a student borrower who is entering the first year of a program of undergraduate education, and who has not previously obtained a loan under this part, shall not (regardless of the amount of such loan or the duration of the period of enrollment) be presented by the institution to the student for endorsement until 30 days after the borrower begins a course of study, but may be delivered to the eligible institution prior to the end of that 30-day period. An institution whose cohort default rate (as determined under [section 1085(m) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1085/m]) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available is less than 10 percent shall be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 422(d) of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, the second sentence of this paragraph shall be effective beginning on February 8, 2006.

        (2) __Other students__ 

            The proceeds of any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part that is made to any student other than a student described in paragraph (1) shall not be disbursed more than 30 days prior to the beginning of the period of enrollment for which the loan is made.

        (3) __Amendment to cohort default rate exemption__ 

            Beginning on October 1, 2011, the exemption to the requirements of paragraph (1) in the second sentence of such paragraph shall be applied by substituting “15 percent” for “10 percent”.

    (c) __Method of multiple disbursement__ 

    Disbursements under subsection (a) of this section—

        (1) shall be made in accordance with a schedule provided by the institution (under [section 1078(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/a/2/A/i/II]) that complies with the requirements of this section;

        (2) may be made directly by the lender or, in the case of a loan under sections 1078 and 1078–1  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, may be disbursed pursuant to the escrow provisions of [section 1078(i) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/i]; and

        (3) notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), may, with the permission of the borrower, be disbursed by the lender on a weekly or monthly basis, provided that the proceeds of the loan are disbursed by the lender in substantially equal weekly or monthly installments, as the case may be, over the period of enrollment for which the loan is made.

    (d) __Withholding of second disbursement__ 

        (1) __Withdrawing students__ 

            A lender or escrow agent that is informed by the borrower or the institution that the borrower has ceased to be enrolled before the disbursement of the second or any succeeding installment shall withhold such disbursement. Any disbursement which is so withheld shall be credited to the borrower’s loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.

        (2) __Students receiving over-awards__ 

            If the sum of a disbursement for any student and the other financial aid obtained by such student exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, the institution such student is attending shall withhold and return to the lender or escrow agent the portion (or all) of such installment that exceeds such eligible amount, except that overawards permitted pursuant to [section 2753(b)(4) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s2753/b/4] shall not be construed to be overawards for purposes of this paragraph. Any portion (or all) of a disbursement installment which is so returned shall be credited to the borrower’s loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.

    (e) __Exclusion of consolidation and foreign study loans__ 

        The provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a loan made under [section 1078–3 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–3], or made to a student to cover the cost of attendance in a program of study abroad approved by the home eligible institution if the home eligible institution has a cohort default rate (as calculated under [section 1085(m) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1085/m]) of less than 5 percent.

    (f) __Beginning of period of enrollment__ 

        For purposes of this section, a period of enrollment begins on the first day that classes begin for the applicable period of enrollment.

    (g) __Sales prior to disbursement prohibited__ 

    An eligible lender shall not sell or transfer a promissory note for any loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part until the final disbursement of such loan has been made, except that the prohibition of this subsection shall not apply if—

        (1) the sale of the loan does not result in a change in the identity of the party to whom payments will be made for the loan; and

        (2) the first disbursement of such loan has been made.
