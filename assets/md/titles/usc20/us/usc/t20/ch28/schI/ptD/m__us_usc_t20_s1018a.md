    (b) __In general__ 

    Except as provided in this section, the PBO shall abide by all applicable Federal procurement laws and regulations when procuring property and services. The PBO shall—

            (B) assess the efficiency of such systems and assess such systems’ ability to meet PBO requirements.

    (c) __Service contracts__ 

        (1) __Performance-based servicing contracts__ 

            The Chief Operating Officer shall, to the extent practicable, maximize the use of performance-based servicing contracts, consistent with guidelines for such contracts published by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, to achieve cost savings and improve service.

        (2) __Fee for service arrangements__ 

            The Chief Operating Officer shall, when appropriate and consistent with the purposes of the PBO, acquire services related to the functions set forth in [section 1018(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1018/b/2] from any entity that has the capability and capacity to meet the requirements set by the PBO. The Chief Operating Officer is authorized to pay fees that are equivalent to those paid by other entities to an organization that provides services that meet the requirements of the PBO, as determined by the Chief Operating Officer.

    (d) __Two-phase source-selection procedures__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The PBO may use a two-phase process for selecting a source for a procurement of property or services.

        (2) __First phase__ 

        The procedures for the first phase of the process for a procurement are as follows:

            (A) __Publication of notice__ 

            The contracting officer for the procurement shall publish a notice of the procurement in accordance with [section 1708 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s1708] and subsections (e), (f), and (g) of [section 637 of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s637], except that the notice shall include only the following:

            (B) __Information submitted by offerors__ 

                Each offeror for the procurement shall submit basic information, such as information on the offeror’s qualifications, the proposed conceptual approach, costs likely to be associated with the proposed conceptual approach, and past performance of the offeror, together with any additional information that is requested by the contracting officer.

            (C) __Selection for second phase__ 

                The contracting officer shall select the offerors that are to be eligible to participate in the second phase of the process.

        (2) the expiration of the authority to use special simplified procedures under section 4202(e) of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 ([110 Stat. 654][/us/stat/110/654]; [10 U.S.C. 2304][/us/usc/t10/s2304] note).

        (1) __In general__ 

            The PBO may satisfy the requirements of the PBO for a system incrementally by carrying out successive procurements of modules of the system. In doing so, the PBO may use procedures authorized under this subsection to procure any such module after the first module.

        (2) __Utility requirement__ 

            A module may not be procured for a system under this subsection unless the module is useful independently of the other modules or useful in combination with another module previously procured for the system.

        (3) __Conditions for use of authority__ 

        The PBO may use procedures authorized under paragraph (4) for the procurement of an additional module for a system if—

            (A) competitive procedures were used for awarding the contract for the procurement of the first module for the system; and

            (B)

             the solicitation for the first module included—

                (i) a general description of the entire system that was sufficient to provide potential offerors with reasonable notice of the general scope of future modules;

                (ii) other information sufficient for potential offerors to make informed business judgments regarding whether to submit offers for the contract for the first module; and

                (iii) a statement that procedures authorized under this subsection could be used for awarding subsequent contracts for the procurement of additional modules for the system.

                Award of the contract on a single-source basis to a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system under competitive procedures or procedures authorized under subparagraph (B).

            Award of the contract on the basis of offers made by—

                (i) a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system after having been selected for award of the contract under this subparagraph or other competitive procedures; and

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Publication of a notice is not required under this paragraph with respect to a use of procedures authorized under paragraph (4) if the contractor referred to in that subparagraph (who is to be solicited to submit an offer) has previously provided a module for the system under a contract that contained cost, schedule, and performance goals and the contractor met those goals.

            (C) __Content of notice__ 

                A notice published under subparagraph (A) with respect to a use of procedures described in paragraph (4) shall contain the information required under [section 1708(c) of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s1708/c], other than paragraph (4) of such section, and shall invite the submission of any assertion that the use of the procedures for the procurement involved is not in the best interest of the Federal Government together with information supporting the assertion.

        (6) __Documentation__ 

            The basis for an award of a contract under this subsection shall be documented. However, a justification pursuant to [section 3304(e) of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s3304/e] or [section 637(h) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s637/h] is not required.

        (7) __Simplified source-selection procedures__ 

            The PBO may award a contract under any other simplified procedures prescribed by the PBO for the selection of sources for the procurement of modules for a system, after the first module, that are not to be procured under a contract awarded on a single-source basis.

    (h) __Use of simplified procedures for small business set-asides for services other than commercial items__ 

        (1) __Authority__
