        (11) a definition of default and the consequences to the borrower if the borrower defaults, together with a statement that the disbursement of, and the default on, a loan under this part, shall be reported to a consumer reporting agency;

        (12) to the extent practicable, the effect of accepting the loan on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student assistance;

        (13) an explanation of any cost the borrower may incur in the making or collection of the loan;

        (14) a notice and explanation regarding the end to future availability of loans made under this part;

        (18) with respect to current undergraduate Federal Perkins loan borrowers, as described in [section 1087aa(b)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087aa/b/1/B], a notice and explanation providing a comparison of the interest rates of loans under this part and part C of this subchapter and informing the borrower that the borrower has reached the maximum annual borrowing limit for which the borrower is eligible on Federal Direct Stafford Loans as referenced under [section 1087e(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087e/a/2/A].

    (b) __Disclosure required prior to repayment__ 

    Each institution of higher education shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the institution will, prior to the start of the repayment period of the student borrower on loans made under this part, disclose to the student borrower the information required under this subsection. Any disclosure required by this subsection may be made by an institution of higher education either in a promissory note evidencing the loan or loans or in a written statement provided to the borrower. The disclosures shall include—

        (1) the name of the institution of higher education, and the address to which communications and payments should be sent;

        (2) the scheduled date upon which the repayment period is to begin;

    (c) __Costs and effects of disclosures__ 

        Such information shall be available without cost to the borrower. The failure of an eligible institution to provide information as required by this section shall not (1) relieve a borrower of the obligation to repay a loan in accordance with its terms, (2) provide a basis for a claim for civil damages, or (3) be deemed to abrogate the obligation of the Secretary to make payments with respect to such loan.
