        (2) If the institution determines that the student inadvertently borrowed amounts in excess of such annual or aggregate maximum loan limits, such institution shall allow the student to repay any amount borrowed in excess of such limits prior to certifying the student’s eligibility for further assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42.

    (g) __Verification of immigration status__

        (1) if the institution has provided such eligibility based on a verification of satisfactory immigration status by the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

        (2) because the institution, under subsection (g)(4)(A)(i) of this section, was required to provide a reasonable opportunity to submit documentation, or

        (3) because the institution, under subsection (g)(4)(B)(i) of this section, was required to wait for the response of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the institution’s request for official verification of the immigration status of the student.

    (i) __Validity of loan guarantees for loan payments made before immigration status verification completed__ 

    Notwithstanding subsection (h) 1 of this section, if—

        (1) a guaranty is made under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for a loan made with respect to an individual,

        (2) at the time the guaranty is entered into, the provisions of subsection (h) 1 of this section had been complied with,

        (3) amounts are paid under the loan subject to such guaranty, and

        (4) there is a subsequent determination that, because of an unsatisfactory immigration status, the individual is not eligible for the loan,

        the official of the institution making the determination shall notify and instruct the entity making the loan to cease further payments under the loan, but such guaranty shall not be voided or otherwise nullified with respect to such payments made before the date the entity receives the notice.

        (3) __Special rule__ 

            For award years beginning prior to July 1, 2008, the Secretary shall not take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other action based on a violation of this subsection against a student or an eligible institution when such action arises out of such institution’s prior award of student assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 if the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that its course of instruction would have been in conformance with the requirements of this subsection.

    (m) __Students with a first baccalaureate or professional degree__

        (2) If there is a determination by the Secretary that the social security number provided to an eligible institution by a student is incorrect, the institution shall deny or terminate the student’s eligibility for any grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 until such time as the student provides documented evidence of a social security number that is determined by the institution to be correct.

        (4)

         Nothing in this subsection shall permit the Secretary to take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against—
