## § 1091b. Institutional refunds

    (a) __Return of title IV funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If a recipient of assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 withdraws from an institution during a payment period or period of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the amount of grant or loan assistance (other than assistance received under part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42) to be returned to the title IV programs is calculated according to paragraph (3) and returned in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.

        (2) __Leave of absence__ 

            (A) __Leave not treated as withdrawal__ 

            In the case of a student who takes 1 or more leaves of absence from an institution for not more than a total of 180 days in any 12-month period, the institution may consider the student as not having withdrawn from the institution during the leave of absence, and not calculate the amount of grant and loan assistance provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that is to be returned in accordance with this section if—

                (i) the institution has a formal policy regarding leaves of absence;

                (ii) the student followed the institution’s policy in requesting a leave of absence; and

                (iii) the institution approved the student’s request in accordance with the institution’s policy.

            (B) __Consequences of failure to return__ 

                If a student does not return to the institution at the expiration of an approved leave of absence that meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), the institution shall calculate the amount of grant and loan assistance provided under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that is to be returned in accordance with this section based on the day the student withdrew (as determined under subsection (c) of this section).

        (3) __Calculation of amount of title IV assistance earned__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amount of grant or loan assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that is earned by the recipient for purposes of this section is calculated by—

                (i) determining the percentage of grant and loan assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that has been earned by the student, as described in subparagraph (B); and

                (ii) applying such percentage to the total amount of such grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed) to the student, or on the student’s behalf, for the payment period or period of enrollment for which the assistance was awarded, as of the day the student withdrew.

            (B) __Percentage earned__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the percentage of grant or loan assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that has been earned by the student is—

                (i) equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment for which assistance was awarded that was completed (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this section) as of the day the student withdrew, provided that such date occurs on or before the completion of 60 percent of the payment period or period of enrollment; or

                (ii) 100 percent, if the day the student withdrew occurs after the student has completed (as determined in accordance with subsection (d)) 60 percent of the payment period or period of enrollment.

            (C) __Percentage and amount not earned__ 

            For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, the amount of grant and loan assistance awarded under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that has not been earned by the student shall be calculated by—

                (i) determining the complement of the percentage of grant assistance under subparts 1 and 3 of part A, or loan assistance under parts B, C, and D, that has been earned by the student described in subparagraph (B); and

                (ii) applying the percentage determined under clause (i) to the total amount of such grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed) to the student, or on the student’s behalf, for the payment period or period of enrollment, as of the day the student withdrew.

        (4) __Differences between amounts earned and amounts received__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                After determining the eligibility of the student for a late disbursement or post-withdrawal disbursement (as required in regulations prescribed by the Secretary), the institution of higher education shall contact the borrower and obtain confirmation that the loan funds are still required by the borrower. In making such contact, the institution shall explain to the borrower the borrower’s obligation to repay the funds following any such disbursement. The institution shall document in the borrower’s file the result of such contact and the final determination made concerning such disbursement.

            (B) __Return__ 

                If the student has received more grant or loan assistance than the amount earned as calculated under paragraph (3)(A), the unearned funds shall be returned by the institution or the student, or both, as may be required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section, to the programs under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 in the order specified in subsection (b)(3) of this section.

    (b) __Return of title IV program funds__ 

        (1) __Responsibility of the institution__ 

        The institution shall return not later than 45 days from the determination of withdrawal, in the order specified in paragraph (3), the lesser of—

            (A) the amount of grant and loan assistance awarded under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that has not been earned by the student, as calculated under subsection (a)(3)(C) of this section; or

            (B)

             an amount equal to—

                (i) the total institutional charges incurred by the student for the payment period or period of enrollment for which such assistance was awarded; multiplied by

                (ii) the percentage of grant and loan assistance awarded under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 that has not been earned by the student, as described in subsection (a)(3)(C)(i) of this section.

        (2) __Responsibility of the student__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Special rule__ 

            The student (or parent in the case of funds due to a loan borrowed by a parent under part B or C of this subchapter) shall return or repay, as appropriate, the amount determined under subparagraph (A) to—

                (i) a loan program under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 in accordance with the terms of the loan; and

                    (II) overpayment collection procedures prescribed by the Secretary.

            (C) __Grant overpayment requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__

                    (II) 50 percent of the total grant assistance received by the student under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for the payment period or period of enrollment.

                (ii) __Minimum__ 

                    A student shall not be required to return amounts of $50 or less.

            (D) __Waivers of Federal Pell Grant repayment by students affected by disasters__ 

            The Secretary may waive the amounts that students are required to return under this section with respect to Federal Pell Grants if the withdrawals on which the returns are based are withdrawals by students—

            In addition to the waivers authorized by subparagraph (D), the Secretary may waive the amounts that students are required to return under this section with respect to any other grant assistance under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 if the withdrawals on which the returns are based are withdrawals by students—
