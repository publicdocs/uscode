## § 1136b. Masters degree programs at predominantly Black institutions

    (a) __Grant program authorized__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to the availability of funds appropriated to carry out this section, the Secretary shall award program grants to each of the institutions listed in subsection (b)(1) that is determined by the Secretary to be making a substantial contribution to graduate education opportunities at the masters level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines for Black Americans.

        (2) __Assurance of non-Federal matching funds__ 

            No grant in excess of $1,000,000 may be made under this section unless the institution provides assurances that 50 percent of the cost of the purposes for which the grant is made will be paid from non-Federal sources, except that no institution shall be required to match any portion of the first $1,000,000 of the institution’s award from the Secretary. After funds are made available to each eligible institution under the funding rules described in subsection (f), the Secretary shall distribute, on a pro rata basis, any amounts which were not so made available (by reason of the failure of an institution to comply with the matching requirements of this paragraph) among the institutions that have complied with such matching requirement.

        (3) __Minimum award__ 

            Subject to subsections (f) and (g), the amount awarded to each eligible institution listed in subsection (b)(1) for a fiscal year shall be not less than $500,000.

        (4) __Duration of grants__ 

            A grant awarded under this section shall be for a period of not more than six years, but may be periodically renewed for a period to be determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Qualified masters degree program__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For the purposes of this section, the term “qualified masters degree program” means a masters degree program that provides a program of instruction in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines in which African Americans are underrepresented and has students enrolled in such program of instruction at the time of application for a grant under this section.

            (B) __Enrollment exception__ 

                Notwithstanding the enrollment requirement contained in subparagraph (A), an institution may use an amount equal to not more than 10 percent of the institution’s grant under this section for the development of a new qualified masters degree program.

        (3) __Institutional choice__ 

            The president or chancellor of the institution may decide which graduate school or qualified masters degree program will receive funds under the grant in any one fiscal year, if the allocation of funds among the schools or programs is delineated in the application for funds submitted to the Secretary under this section.

        (4) __One grant per institution__ 

            The Secretary shall not award more than one grant under this section in any fiscal year to any institution of higher education.

    (c) __Application__ 

    An eligible institution listed in subsection (b)(1) desiring a grant under this section shall submit an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. The application shall—

        (1) demonstrate how the grant funds under this section will be used to improve graduate educational opportunities for Black and low-income students and lead to greater financial independence; and

        (2) provide, in the case of applications for grants in excess of $1,000,000, the assurances required under subsection (a)(2) and specify the manner in which the eligible institution is going to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of the application.

        (4) scholarships, fellowships, and other financial assistance for needy graduate students to permit the enrollment of the students in, and completion of, a masters degree in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines in which African Americans are underrepresented;
