        (1) __Determination of minimum disclosures__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Not later than 18 months after August 14, 2008, the Secretary, in coordination with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall determine the minimum information that lenders, covered institutions, and institution-affiliated organizations of such covered institutions participating in preferred lender arrangements shall make available regarding education loans described in [section 1019(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1019/3/A] that are offered to students and the families of such students.

            In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—

                (i) consult with students, the families of such students, representatives of covered institutions (including financial aid administrators, admission officers, and business officers), representatives of institution-affiliated organizations, secondary school guidance counselors, lenders, loan servicers, and guaranty agencies;

                (ii) include, in the minimum information under subparagraph (A) that is required to be made available, the information that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System requires to be disclosed under [section 1638(e)(1) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s1638/e/1], modified as necessary to apply to such loans; and

                (iii)

                 consider the merits of requiring each covered institution, and each institution-affiliated organization of such covered institution, with a preferred lender arrangement to provide to prospective borrowers and the families of such borrowers the following information for each type of education loan offered pursuant to such preferred lender arrangement:

                    (I) The interest rate and terms and conditions of the loan for the next award year, including loan forgiveness and deferment.

                    (II)

                     Information on any charges, such as origination and Federal default fees, that are payable on the loan, and whether those charges will be—

                        (aa) collected by the lender at or prior to the disbursal of the loan, including whether the charges will be deducted from the proceeds of the loan or paid separately by the borrower; or

                        (bb) paid in whole or in part by the lender.

                    (III) The annual and aggregate maximum amounts that may be borrowed.

                    (IV) The average amount borrowed from the lender by students who graduated from such institution in the preceding year with certificates, undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, and professional degrees, as applicable, and who obtained loans of such type from the lender for the preceding year.

                    (V)

                     The amount the borrower may pay in interest, based on a standard repayment plan and the average amount borrowed from the lender by students who graduated from such institution in the preceding year and who obtained loans of such type from the lender for the preceding year, for—

                        (aa) borrowers of loans made under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078];

                        (bb) borrowers of loans made under section 1078–2 or 1078–8 of this title, who pay the interest while in school; and

                        (cc) borrowers of loans made under section 1078–2 or 1078–8 of this title, who do not pay the interest while in school.

                    (VI) The consequences for the borrower of defaulting on a loan, including limitations on the discharge of an education loan in bankruptcy.
