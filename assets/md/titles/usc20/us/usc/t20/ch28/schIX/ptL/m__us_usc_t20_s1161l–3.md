        To determine the amount of a loan to make available to an institution of higher education under this section, the Secretary shall calculate the monetary amount of losses incurred by such institution as a result of a major disaster or emergency declared by the President, and shall reduce such amount by the amount of collateral source compensation the institution has already received from insurance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Small Business Administration.
