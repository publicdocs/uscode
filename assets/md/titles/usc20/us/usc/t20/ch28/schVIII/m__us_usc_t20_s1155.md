            The Corporation shall not be an agency, instrumentality, or establishment of the United States Government, nor a Government corporation, nor a Government controlled corporation, as such terms are defined in [section 103 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s103].

        (2) __Corporate powers__ 

            The Corporation shall be subject to the provisions of this section, and, to the extent not inconsistent with this section, to the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act (or the comparable law of another State, if applicable). The Corporation shall have the powers conferred upon a corporation by the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act (or such other applicable State law) as from time to time in effect in order to conduct the Corporation’s affairs as a private, for-profit corporation and to carry out the Corporation’s purposes and activities incidental thereto. The Corporation shall have the power to enter into contracts, to execute instruments, to incur liabilities, to provide products and services, and to do all things as are necessary or incidental to the proper management of the Corporation’s affairs and the efficient operation of a private, for-profit business.

        (3) __Limitation on ownership of stock__

            (C) __Financial support or guarantees__ 

                After the Secretary of the Treasury sells the stock of the Corporation owned by the Secretary of Education pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Student Loan Marketing Association may provide financial support or guarantees to the Corporation, if such support or guarantees are subject to terms and conditions that are no more advantageous to the Corporation than the terms and conditions the Student Loan Marketing Association provides to other entities, including, where applicable, other monoline financial guaranty corporations in which the Student Loan Marketing Association has no ownership interest.

        (4) __No Federal guarantee__ 

            (A) __Obligations insured by the Corporation__
