        (4)

         provide that where a note or written agreement evidencing a loan has been in default despite due diligence on the part of the institution in attempting collection thereon—

            (A)

             if the institution has knowingly failed to maintain an acceptable collection record with respect to such loan, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with criteria established by regulation, the Secretary may—

                (ii) apportion any sums collected on such a loan, less an amount not to exceed 30 percent of any sums collected to cover the Secretary’s collection costs, among other institutions in accordance with [section 1087bb of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087bb]; or

        (2)

         Each cooperative agreement made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be made in accordance with the requirements of [section 1080a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1080a] except that such agreement shall provide for the disclosure by the Secretary or an institution, as the case may be, to such consumer reporting agencies, with respect to any loan held by the Secretary or the institution, respectively, of—

            (A) the date of disbursement and the amount of such loans made to any borrower under this part at the time of disbursement of the loan;

        (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (a) of [section 1681c of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s1681c], a consumer reporting agency may make a report containing information received from the Secretary or an institution regarding the status of a borrower’s account on a loan made under this part until the loan is paid in full.

        (4)

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an institution of higher education, after consultation with the Secretary and pursuant to the agreements entered into under paragraph (1), shall disclose at least annually to any consumer reporting agency with which the Secretary has such an agreement the information set forth in paragraph (2), and shall disclose promptly to such consumer reporting agency any changes to the information previously disclosed.

            (B) The Secretary may promulgate regulations establishing criteria under which an institution of higher education may cease reporting the information described in paragraph (2) before a loan is paid in full.

    (d) __Limitation on use of interest bearing accounts__ 

        In carrying out the provisions of subsection (a)(9) of this section, the Secretary may not require that any collection agency, collection attorney, or loan servicer collecting loans made under this part deposit amounts collected on such loans in interest bearing accounts, unless such agency, attorney, or servicer holds such amounts for more than 45 days.

    (e) __Special due diligence rule__ 

        In carrying out the provisions of subsection (a)(5) 1 of this section relating to due diligence, the Secretary shall make every effort to ensure that institutions of higher education may use Internal Revenue Service skip-tracing collection procedures on loans made under this part.
