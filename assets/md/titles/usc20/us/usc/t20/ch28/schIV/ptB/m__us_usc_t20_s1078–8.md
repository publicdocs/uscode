## § 1078–8. Unsubsidized Stafford loans for middle-income borrowers

    (a) __In general__ 

        It is the purpose of this section to authorize insured loans under this part that are first disbursed before July 1, 2010, for borrowers who do not qualify for Federal interest subsidy payments under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078]. Except as provided in this section, all terms and conditions for Federal Stafford loans established under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078] shall apply to loans made pursuant to this section.

    (b) __Eligible borrowers__ 

    Prior to July 1, 2010, any student meeting the requirements for student eligibility under [section 1091 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1091] (including graduate and professional students as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary) shall be entitled to borrow an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan for which the first disbursement is made before such date if the eligible institution at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, has—

        (1) determined and documented the student’s need for the loan based on the student’s estimated cost of attendance (as determined under section 1087ll of this title) and the student’s estimated financial assistance, including a loan which qualifies for interest subsidy payments under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078]; and

        (2)

         provided the lender a statement—

            (A) certifying the eligibility of the student to receive a loan under this section and the amount of the loan for which such student is eligible, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; and

            (B) setting forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of [section 1078–7 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–7].

    (c) __Determination of amount of loan__ 

        The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.

    (d) __Loan limits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under [section 1078(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/b/1], less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under [section 1078 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078].

                (i) in the case of such a student who is a graduate or professional student attending an eligible institution, $12,000; and

                (ii)

                 notwithstanding paragraph (4), in the case of an independent student, or a dependent student whose parents are unable to borrow under [section 1078–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–2] or the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program, who has obtained a baccalaureate degree and who is enrolled in coursework specified in paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of [section 1091(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1091/b]—

                except in cases where the Secretary determines that a higher amount is warranted in order to carry out the purpose of this part with respect to students engaged in specialized training requiring exceptionally high costs of education, but the annual insurable limit per student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments by the lender to the borrower will not be made in any years in excess of the annual limit.

            (B) __Aggregate limit__ 

                The maximum aggregate amount of loans under this section a student described in subparagraph (A) may borrow shall be the amount described in paragraph (1), adjusted to reflect the increased annual limits described in subparagraph (A), as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation.

                    (II) if such student is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education which is less than one academic year, the maximum annual loan amount that such student may receive may not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subclause (I) as the length of such program measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock hours bears to one academic year;

                (i) be paid monthly or quarterly; or

                (ii)

                 be added to the principal amount of the loan by the lender only—

                    (I) when the loan enters repayment;

                    (II) at the expiration of a grace period, in the case of a loan that qualifies for a grace period;

                    (III) at the expiration of a period of deferment or forbearance; or

At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that—

            (A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or
