## § 1087i–1. Temporary authority to purchase student loans

    (a) __Authority to purchase__ 

        (1) __Authority; determination required__ 

            Upon a determination by the Secretary that there is an inadequate availability of loan capital to meet the demand for loans under sections 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title, whether as a result of inadequate liquidity for such loans or for other reasons, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to purchase, or enter into forward commitments to purchase, from any eligible lender, as defined by [section 1085(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1085/d/1], loans first disbursed under sections 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title on or after October 1, 2003, and before July 1, 2010, on such terms as the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget jointly determine are in the best interest of the United States, except that any purchase under this section shall not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased), as determined jointly by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

        (2) __Federal Register notice__ 

        The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall jointly publish a notice in the Federal Register prior to any purchase of loans under paragraph (1) that—

            (A) establishes the terms and conditions governing the purchases authorized by paragraph (1);

            (B) includes an outline of the methodology and factors that the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will jointly consider in evaluating the price at which to purchase loans made under section 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title; and

            (C) describes how the use of such methodology and consideration of such factors used to determine purchase price will ensure that loan purchases do not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased).

        (3) __Temporary authority to purchase rehabilitated loans__ 

            (A) __Authority__ 

                In addition to the authority described in paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to purchase, or enter into forward commitments to purchase, from any eligible lender (as defined in [section 1085(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1085/d/1]), loans that such lender purchased under [section 1078–6 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–6] on or after October 1, 2003, and before July 1, 2010, and that are not in default, on such terms as the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget jointly determine are in the best interest of the United States, except that any purchase under this paragraph shall not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased), as determined jointly by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

            (B) __Federal Register notice__ 

            The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall jointly publish a notice in the Federal Register prior to any purchase of loans under this paragraph that—

                (i) establishes the terms and conditions governing the purchases authorized by this paragraph;

                (ii) includes an outline of the methodology and factors that the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will jointly consider in evaluating the price at which to purchase loans rehabilitated pursuant to [section 1078–6(a) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–6/a]; and

                (iii) describes how the use of such methodology and consideration of such factors used to determine purchase price will ensure that loan purchases do not result in any net cost to the Federal Government (including the cost of servicing the loans purchased).

    (b) __Proceeds__ 

    The Secretary shall require, as a condition of any purchase under subsection (a), that the funds paid by the Secretary to any eligible lender under this section be used—

        (1) to ensure continued participation of such lender in the Federal student loan programs authorized under part B of this subchapter; and

        (2)

            (A) in the case of loans purchased pursuant to subsection (a)(1), to originate new Federal loans to students, as authorized under part B of this subchapter; or

            (B) in the case of loans purchased pursuant to subsection (a)(3), to originate such new Federal loans to students, or to purchase loans in accordance with [section 1078–6(a) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078–6/a].

    (c) __Maintaining servicing arrangements__ 

    The Secretary may, if agreed upon by an eligible lender selling loans under this section, contract with such lender for the servicing of the loans purchased, provided that—

        (1) the cost of such servicing arrangement does not exceed the cost the Federal Government would otherwise incur for the servicing of loans purchased, as determined under subsection (a); and

        (2) such servicing arrangement is in the best interest of the borrowers whose loans are purchased.

    (d) __Guaranty agency responsibilities and payments__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42, beginning on the date on which the Secretary purchases a loan under this section—

        (1) the guaranty agency that insured such loan shall cease to have any obligations, responsibilities, or rights (including rights to any payment) under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 for any activity related to the administration of such loan that is carried out or required to be carried out on or after the date of such purchase; and

        (2) the insurance issued by such agency pursuant to [section 1078(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/b] for such loan shall cease to be effective with respect to any default on such loan that occurs on or after the date of such purchase.
