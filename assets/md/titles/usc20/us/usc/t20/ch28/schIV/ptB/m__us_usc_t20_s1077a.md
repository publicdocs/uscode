                (ii) during any other period, by crediting such excess interest to the reduction of principal to the extent provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

        (2) __Amount of adjustment for 10 percent loans__ 

        The amount of any adjustment of interest on a loan to be made under this subsection for any quarter shall be equal to—

            (A) 10 percent minus the sum of (i) the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such calendar quarter, and (ii) 3.25 percent; multiplied by

            Any adjustment amount computed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection for any quarter shall be credited, by the holder of the loan on the last day of the calendar year in which such quarter falls, to the loan account of the borrower so as to reduce the principal balance of such account. No such credit shall be made to the loan account of a borrower who on the last day of the calendar year is delinquent for more than 30 days in making a required payment on the loan, but the excess interest shall be calculated and credited to the Secretary. Any credit which is to be made to a borrower’s account pursuant to this subsection shall be made effective commencing no later than 30 days following the last day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls for which the credit is being made. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require refunding any repayment of a loan. At the option of the lender, the amount of such adjustment may be distributed to the borrower either by reduction in the amount of the periodic payment on loan, by reducing the number of payments that shall be made with respect to the loan, or by reducing the amount of the final payment of the loan. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the lender to make additional disclosures pursuant to [section 1083(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1083/b].

The notice shall advise the borrower that such rate shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph and shall provide the borrower with a substantially equivalent benefit as the adjustment otherwise provided for under this subsection. Such notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under [section 1083(b) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1083/b] if such disclosure has not been previously made.

            (D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.

            (E) Loans on which the interest rate is converted in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subsection.
