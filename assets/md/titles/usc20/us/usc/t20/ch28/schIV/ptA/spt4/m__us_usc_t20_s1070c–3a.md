        (2) provide need-based grants for access and persistence to eligible low-income students;

        (3) provide early notification to low-income students of the students’ eligibility for financial aid; and

        (4) encourage increased participation in early information and intervention, mentoring, or outreach programs.

                    If a State that applied for and received an allotment under this section for fiscal year 2010 pursuant to subsection (j) meets the specifications established in the State’s application under subsection (c) for fiscal year 2011, then the Secretary shall make an allotment to such State for fiscal year 2011 that is not less than the allotment made pursuant to subsection (j) to such State for fiscal year 2010 under this section (as this section was in effect on the day before August 14, 2008).
