        (6) contain an assurance that the institution will meet the child care needs of low-income students through the provision of services, or through a contract for the provision of services;

        (7) describe the extent to which the child care program will coordinate with the institution’s early childhood education curriculum, to the extent the curriculum is available, to meet the needs of the students in the early childhood education program at the institution, and the needs of the parents and children participating in the child care program assisted under this section;

        (8)

         in the case of an institution seeking assistance for a new child care program—

        (9) contain an assurance that any child care facility assisted under this section will meet the applicable State or local government licensing, certification, approval, or registration requirements; and

        (10) contain a plan for any child care facility assisted under this section to become accredited within 3 years of the date the institution first receives assistance under this section.

    (d) __Priority__ 

    The Secretary shall give priority in awarding grants under this section to institutions of higher education that submit applications describing programs that—

        (1) leverage significant local or institutional resources, including in-kind contributions, to support the activities assisted under this section; and

        (2) utilize a sliding fee scale for child care services provided under this section in order to support a high number of low-income parents pursuing postsecondary education at the institution.

            (A) __Reports__ 

                Each institution of higher education receiving a grant under this section shall report to the Secretary annually.

        (2) __Continuing eligibility__
