## § 1087–3. Reorganization of Student Loan Marketing Association through formation of Holding Company

    (a) __Actions by Association’s Board of Directors__ 

    The Board of Directors of the Association shall take or cause to be taken all such action as the Board of Directors deems necessary or appropriate to effect, upon the shareholder approval described in subsection (b) of this section, a restructuring of the common stock ownership of the Association, as set forth in a plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors (the terms of which shall be consistent with this section) so that all of the outstanding common shares of the Association shall be directly owned by a Holding Company. Such actions may include, in the Board of Director’s discretion, a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company with and into the Association, which would have the effect provided in the plan of reorganization and the law of the jurisdiction in which such subsidiary is incorporated. As part of the restructuring, the Board of Directors may cause—

        (1) the common shares of the Association to be converted, on the reorganization effective date, to common shares of the Holding Company on a one for one basis, consistent with applicable State or District of Columbia law; and

        (2) Holding Company common shares to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    (b) __Shareholder approval__ 

        The plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to common shareholders of the Association for their approval. The reorganization shall occur on the reorganization effective date, provided that the plan of reorganization has been approved by the affirmative votes, cast in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Association common stock.

    (c) __Transition__ 

    In the event the shareholders of the Association approve the plan of reorganization under subsection (b) of this section, the following provisions shall apply beginning on the reorganization effective date:

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as specifically provided in this section, until the dissolution date the Association shall continue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and restrictions of, [section 1087–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2], and the Association shall continue to carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the limitations and restrictions, applicable to the Association under [section 1087–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2], except as specifically provided in this section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association) shall not purchase loans insured under this chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of title 42 until such time as the Association ceases acquiring such loans, except that the Holding Company may purchase such loans if the Association is merely continuing to acquire loans as a lender of last resort pursuant to [section 1087–2(q) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/q] or under an agreement with the Secretary described in paragraph (6).

        (2) __Transfer of certain property__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in this section, on the reorganization effective date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Association shall use the Association’s best efforts to transfer to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company (or both), as directed by the Holding Company, all real and personal property of the Association (both tangible and intangible) other than the remaining property. Subject to the preceding sentence, such transferred property shall include all right, title, and interest in—

                (i) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Association (excluding special purpose funding companies in existence on September 30, 1996, and any interest in any government-sponsored enterprise);

                (ii) contracts, leases, and other agreements of the Association;

                (iii) licenses and other intellectual property of the Association; and

                (iv) any other property of the Association.

            (B) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the Association from transferring remaining property from time to time to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4).

        (3) __Transfer of personnel__ 

            On the reorganization effective date, employees of the Association shall become employees of the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company), and the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company) shall provide all necessary and appropriate management and operational support (including loan servicing) to the Association, as requested by the Association. The Association, however, may obtain such management and operational support from persons or entities not associated with the Holding Company.

        (4) __Dividends__ 

            The Association may pay dividends in the form of cash or noncash distributions so long as at the time of the declaration of such dividends, after giving effect to the payment of such dividends as of the date of such declaration by the Board of Directors of the Association, the Association’s capital would be in compliance with the capital standards and requirements set forth in [section 1087–2(r) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/r]. If, at any time after the reorganization effective date, the Association fails to comply with such capital standards, the Holding Company shall transfer with due diligence to the Association additional capital in such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the Association again complies with the capital standards.

        (5) __Certification prior to dividend__ 

            Prior to the payment of any dividend under paragraph (4), the Association shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the payment of the dividend will be made in compliance with paragraph (4) and shall provide copies of all calculations needed to make such certification.

        (6) __Restrictions on new business activity or acquisition of assets by Association__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            After the reorganization effective date, the Association shall not engage in any new business activities or acquire any additional program assets described in [section 1087–2(d) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/d] other than in connection with—

                (i) student loan purchases through September 30, 2007;

                (ii) contractual commitments for future warehousing advances, or pursuant to letters of credit or standby bond purchase agreements, which are outstanding as of the reorganization effective date;

                (iii) the Association serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to [section 1087–2(q) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/q]; and

                (iv) the Association’s purchase of loans insured under this part, if the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, enters into an agreement with the Association for the continuation or resumption of the Association’s secondary market purchase program because the Secretary determines there is inadequate liquidity for loans made under this part.

            (B) __Agreement__ 

                The Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement described in clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) with the Association covering such secondary market activities. Any agreement entered into under such clause shall cover a period of 12 months, but may be renewed if the Secretary determines that liquidity remains inadequate. The fee provided under [section 1087–2(h)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/h/7] shall not apply to loans acquired under any such agreement with the Secretary.

        (7) __Issuance of debt obligations during the transition period; attributes of debt obligations__ 

            After the reorganization effective date, the Association shall not issue debt obligations which mature later than September 30, 2008, except in connection with serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to [section 1087–2(q) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/q] or with purchasing loans under an agreement with the Secretary as described in paragraph (6). Nothing in this section shall modify the attributes accorded the debt obligations of the Association by [section 1087–2 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2], regardless of whether such debt obligations are incurred prior to, or at any time following, the reorganization effective date or are transferred to a trust in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

        (8) __Monitoring of safety and soundness__ 

            (A) __Obligation to obtain, maintain, and report information__ 

            The Association shall obtain such information and make and keep such records as the Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time prescribe concerning—

                (i) the financial risk to the Association resulting from the activities of any associated person, to the extent such activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition of the Association, including the Association’s capital ratio, the Association’s liquidity, or the Association’s ability to conduct and finance the Association’s operations; and

                (ii) the Association’s policies, procedures, and systems for monitoring and controlling any such financial risk.

            (B) __Summary reports__ 

                The Secretary of the Treasury may require summary reports of the information described in subparagraph (A) to be filed no more frequently than quarterly. If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided pursuant to this subparagraph or other available information, the Secretary of the Treasury has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of the Association, the Secretary of the Treasury may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence and subparagraph (A), require the Association to make reports concerning the activities of any associated person whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the Association.

                (i) __In general__

                (v) __One officer requirement__ 

                    At least one officer of the Association shall be an officer solely of the Association.

                (vi) __Transactions__ 

                    Transactions between the Association and the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company, including any loan servicing arrangements, shall be on terms no less favorable to the Association than the Association could obtain from an unrelated third party offering comparable services.

 __Repeal of Section__ 

[Pub. L. 104–208, div. A, title I, § 101(e)][/us/pl/104/208/s101/e] \[title VI, § 602(d)\], Sept. 30, 1996, [110 Stat. 3009–233][/us/stat/110/3009-233], 3009–289, provided that this section is repealed effective one year after date on which all obligations of trust established under subsec. (d)(1) of this section have been extinguished, if reorganization occurs in accordance with this section, or date on which all obligations of trust established under [section 1087–2(s)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–2/s/3/A] have been extinguished, if reorganization does not occur in accordance with this section.

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1155(e) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1155/e], referred to in subsecs. (c)(9)(B) and (e)(3), was in the original a reference to section 3(e) of the Student Loan Marketing Association Reorganization Act of 1996, and was translated as reading section 603(e) of that Act, which is [Pub. L. 104–208, div. A, title I, § 101(e)][/us/pl/104/208/s101/e] \[title VI, § 603(e)\], Sept. 30, 1996, [110 Stat. 3009–233][/us/stat/110/3009-233], 3009–293, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because that Act does not contain a section 3(e), but does contain a section 603(e) which establishes the account referred to in text.
