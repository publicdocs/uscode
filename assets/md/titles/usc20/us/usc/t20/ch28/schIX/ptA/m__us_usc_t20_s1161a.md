        (1) to provide support and assistance to programs implementing integrated education reform services in order to improve secondary school graduation, postsecondary program attendance, and postsecondary completion rates for low-income students; and

        (2) to promote the establishment of new programs to implement such integrated education reform services.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Low-income student__ 

            The term “low-income student” means a student who is determined by a local educational agency to be from a low-income family using the measures described in [section 6313(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s6313/a/5].

        From the amount appropriated to carry out this section, the Secretary is authorized to award a five-year contract to Project GRAD USA (referred to in this section as the “contractor”), a nonprofit education organization that has as its primary purpose the improvement of secondary school graduation and postsecondary attendance and completion rates for low-income students. Such contract shall be used to carry out the requirements of subsection (d) and to implement and sustain integrated education reform services through subcontractor activities described in subsection (e)(3) at existing Project GRAD program sites and to promote the expansion to new sites.

        (2)

         directly carry out—

            (A) activities to implement and sustain the literacy, mathematics, classroom management, social service, and postsecondary access programs further described in subsection (e)(3);

            (B) activities to build the organizational and management capacity of the subcontractors to effectively implement and sustain the programs;

            (C)

             activities for the purpose of improving and expanding the programs, including activities—

                (i) to further articulate a program for one or more grade levels and across grade levels;

                (ii) to tailor a program for a particular target audience; and

                (iii) to provide tighter integration across programs;

            (D) activities for the purpose of implementing new Project GRAD program sites;

            (E) activities for the purpose of promoting greater public awareness of integrated education reform services to improve secondary school graduation and postsecondary attendance rates for low-income students; and

            (F) other activities directly related to improving secondary school graduation and postsecondary attendance and completion rates for low-income students; and

            (B) costs associated with carrying out the activities and providing the services, as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

    (e) __Supported programs__ 

        (1) __Designation__ 

            The subcontractor programs referred to in this subsection shall be known as Project GRAD programs.

        (2) __Feeder patterns__ 

        Each subcontractor shall implement a Project GRAD program and shall, with the agreement of the contractor—

            (A) identify or establish not less than one feeder pattern of public schools; and

            (B) provide the integrated educational reform services described in paragraph (3) at each identified feeder pattern.

        (3) __Integrated education reform services__ 

        The services provided through a Project GRAD program may include—

            (A) research-based programs in reading, mathematics, and classroom management;

            (B) campus-based social services programs, including a systematic approach to increase family and community involvement in the schools served by the Project GRAD program;

            (C)

             a postsecondary access program that includes—

                (i) providing postsecondary scholarships for students who meet established criteria;

                (ii) proven approaches for increasing student and family postsecondary awareness; and

                (iii) assistance for students in applying for higher education financial aid; and

            (D) such other services identified by the contractor as necessary to increase secondary school graduation and postsecondary attendance and completion rates.

    (f) __Use of funds__ 

        Of the funds made available to carry out this section, not more than five percent of such funds, or $4,000,000, whichever is less, shall be used by the contractor to pay for administration of the contract.

    (g) __Contribution and matching requirement__
