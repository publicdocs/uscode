            (B) __Prequalification process__ 

            The Secretary establishes a prequalification process for eligible lenders desiring to participate in an auction under this paragraph that contains, at a minimum—

            (C) __Timing and origination__ 

                Each State auction takes place every 2 years, and the eligible lenders with the winning bids for the State are the only eligible lenders permitted to originate eligible Federal PLUS Loans made under this paragraph for the cohort of students at the institutions of higher education within the State until the students graduate from or leave the institutions of higher education.

            (D) __Bids__ 

                Each eligible lender’s bid consists of the amount of the special allowance payment (after the application of [section 1087–1(b)(2)(I)(v) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–1/b/2/I/v]) the eligible lender proposes to accept from the Secretary with respect to the eligible Federal PLUS Loans made under this paragraph in lieu of the amount determined under [section 1087–1(b)(2)(I) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–1/b/2/I].

            (E) __Maximum bid__ 

                The maximum bid allowable under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of the special allowance payable on eligible Federal PLUS Loans made under this paragraph computed under [section 1087–1(b)(2)(I) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–1/b/2/I] (other than clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi) of such section), except that for purposes of the computation under this subparagraph, [section 1087–1(b)(2)(I)(i)(III) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1087–1/b/2/I/i/III] shall be applied by substituting “1.79 percent” for “2.34 percent”.

                    (I)

                     The assessment of a penalty on such eligible lender for any eligible Federal PLUS Loans that such eligible lender fails to originate under this paragraph in accordance with the agreement required under clause (i), in the amount of the additional costs (including the amounts of any increase in special allowance payments) incurred by the Secretary in obtaining another eligible lender to originate such eligible Federal PLUS Loans. The Secretary shall collect such penalty by—

                        (aa) reducing the amount of any payments otherwise due to such eligible lender from the Secretary by the amount of the penalty; or

                        (bb) requesting any other Federal agency to reduce the amount of any payments due to such eligible lender from such agency by the amount of the penalty, in accordance with [section 3716 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3716].

                (ii) __Determination of eligible lender of last resort__ 

                    Prior to the start of any auction under this paragraph, eligible lenders that desire to serve as an eligible lender of last resort shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may determine.

                    The Secretary is authorized to set a special allowance payment that shall be payable to a lender of last resort for a State under this subparagraph, which special allowance payment shall be kept confidential, including following the announcement of winning bids. The Secretary shall set such special allowance payment so that it incurs the lowest possible cost to the Federal Government, taking into consideration the lowest bid that was submitted in an auction for such State and the lowest bid submitted in a similar State, as determined by the Secretary.

                Each eligible Federal PLUS Loan originated under this paragraph shall be insured by a guaranty agency in accordance with part B, except that, notwithstanding [section 1078(b)(1)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1078/b/1/G], such insurance shall be in an amount equal to 99 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on the loan.
