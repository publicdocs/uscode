## § 1070h. Scholarships for veteran’s dependents

    (a) __Definition of eligible veteran’s dependent__ 

    The term “eligible veteran’s dependent” means a dependent or an independent student—

        (1) whose parent or guardian was a member of the Armed Forces of the United States and died as a result of performing military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001; and

        (2)

         who, at the time of the parent or guardian’s death, was—

            (A) less than 24 years of age; or

            (B) enrolled at an institution of higher education on a part-time or full-time basis.

    (b) __Grants__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award a grant to each eligible veteran’s dependent to assist in paying the eligible veteran’s dependent’s cost of attendance at an institution of higher education.

        (2) __Designation__ 

            Grants made under this section shall be known as “Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants”.

    (c) __Prevention of double benefits__ 

        No eligible veteran’s dependent may receive a grant under both this section and [section 1070a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070a].

    (d) __Terms and conditions__ 

    The Secretary shall award grants under this section in the same manner, and with the same terms and conditions, including the length of the period of eligibility, as the Secretary awards Federal Pell Grants under [section 1070a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070a], except that—

        (1) the award rules and determination of need applicable to the calculation of Federal Pell Grants, shall not apply to grants made under this section;

        (2) the provisions of subsection (a)(3), subsection (b)(1), the matter following subsection (b)(2)(A)(v), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  subsection (b)(3), and subsection (f), of [section 1070a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070a] shall not apply; and

        (3)

         a grant made under this section to an eligible veteran’s dependent for any award year shall equal the maximum Federal Pell Grant available for that award year, except that such a grant under this section—

            (A) shall not exceed the cost of attendance of the eligible veteran’s dependent for that award year; and

            (B) shall be adjusted to reflect the attendance by the eligible veteran’s dependent on a less than full-time basis in the same manner as such adjustments are made under [section 1070a of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070a].

    (e) __Estimated financial assistance__ 

        For purposes of determinations of need under part E, a grant awarded under this section shall not be treated as estimated financial assistance as described in sections 1087kk(3) and 1087vv(j) of this title.

    (f) __Authorization and appropriations of funds__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated, and there are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Secretary to carry out this section, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2010 and each succeeding fiscal year.
