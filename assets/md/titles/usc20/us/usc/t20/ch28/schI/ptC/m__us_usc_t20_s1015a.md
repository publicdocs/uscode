    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __College Navigator website__ 

            The term “College Navigator website” means the College Navigator website operated by the Department and includes any successor website.

        (2) __Cost of attendance__

        (3) __Net price__ 

        The term “net price” means the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at an institution of higher education after deducting such aid, which shall be determined by calculating the difference between—

            (A) the institution’s cost of attendance for the year for which the determination is made; and

            (B)

             the quotient of—

                (i) the total amount of need-based grant aid and merit-based grant aid, from Federal, State, and institutional sources, provided to such students enrolled in the institution for such year; and

                (ii) the total number of such students receiving such need-based grant aid or merit-based grant aid for such year.

        (4) __Tuition and fees__ 

            The term “tuition and fees” means the average annual cost of tuition and fees for an institution of higher education for first-time, full-time undergraduate students enrolled in the institution.

    (b) __Calculations for public institutions__ 

    In making the calculations regarding cost of attendance, net price, and tuition and fees under this section with respect to a public institution of higher education, the Secretary shall calculate the cost of attendance, net price, and tuition and fees at such institution in the manner described in subsection (a), except that—

        (1) the cost of attendance, net price, and tuition and fees shall be calculated for first-time, full-time undergraduate students enrolled in the institution who are residents of the State in which such institution is located; and

        (2) in determining the net price, the average need-based grant aid and merit-based grant aid described in subsection (a)(3)(B) shall be calculated based on the average total amount of such aid received by first-time, full-time undergraduate students who are residents of the State in which such institution is located, divided by the total number of such resident students receiving such need-based grant aid or merit-based grant aid at such institution.

    (c) __College affordability and transparency lists__

            (C) A list of the five percent of institutions in each such category that have the largest increase, expressed as a percentage change, in tuition and fees over the most recent three academic years for which data are available, using the first academic year of the three-year period as the base year to compute such percentage change.
