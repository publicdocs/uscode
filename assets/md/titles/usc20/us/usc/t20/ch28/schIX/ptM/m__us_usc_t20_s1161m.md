        (2) __Use of funds__ 

            Funds awarded to an institution of higher education under paragraph (1) shall be distributed by the institution in the form of need-based grant aid to students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants, except that no student shall receive an amount under this section that would cause the amount of total financial aid received by such student to exceed the cost of attendance of the institution.

        (1) four-year public institutions of higher education;

            For each institution of higher education that the Secretary determines complies with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide to such institution a bonus amount. Such institution shall award the bonus amount in the form of need-based aid first to students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants who were in attendance at the institution during the award year that such institution satisfied the eligibility criteria for maintaining low tuition and fees, then to students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants who were not in attendance at the institution during such award year.

        (3) __Less-than four-year institutions__
