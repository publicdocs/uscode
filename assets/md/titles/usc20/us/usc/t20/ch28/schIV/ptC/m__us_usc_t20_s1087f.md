                (iii) __Ineligibility__

                (ii) __Servicer allocation__ 

                    The Secretary may reallocate, increase, reduce, or terminate an eligible not-for-profit servicer’s allocation of servicing rights under clause (i) based on the performance of such servicer, on the same terms as loan allocations provided by contracts awarded pursuant to paragraph (1).
