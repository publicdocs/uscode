 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 1070d–35, [Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, § 419E][/us/pl/89/329/s419E], as added [Pub. L. 98–558, title VIII, § 801(a)][/us/pl/98/558/s801/a], Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 2901][/us/stat/98/2901]; amended [Pub.

Byrd Honors Scholarship Program, prior to the general revision of this part by [Pub. L. 99–498][/us/pl/99/498].

 __Amendments__ 

    1992—Par. (3). [Pub. L. 102–325, § 406(g)(2)(A)][/us/pl/102/325/s406/g/2/A], inserted “and” after semicolon.

    Par. (4). [Pub. L. 102–325, § 406(g)(2)(B)][/us/pl/102/325/s406/g/2/B], substituted “$1,500.” for “$1,500 at an awards ceremony in accordance with [section 1070d–39 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070d–39]; and”.

    Par. (5). [Pub. L. 102–325, § 406(g)(3)][/us/pl/102/325/s406/g/3], which directed that par. (5) be struck out without specifying the section to which the amendment applied, was executed by striking out par. (5) of this section to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Prior to amendment, par. (5) read as follows: “the State educational agency will use the amount of the allocation described in paragraph (2) of [section 1070d–34 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070d–34] for administrative expenses, including the conduct of the awards ceremony required by [section 1070d–39 of this title][/us/usc/t20/s1070d–39].”
