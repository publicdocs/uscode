## § 1161v. Modeling and simulation

    (a) __Purpose; definition__ 

        (1) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this section is to promote the study of modeling and simulation at institutions of higher education, through the collaboration with new and existing programs, and specifically to promote the use of technology in such study through the creation of accurate models that can simulate processes or recreate real life, by—

            (A) establishing a task force at the Department of Education to raise awareness of and define the study of modeling and simulation;

            (B) providing grants to institutions of higher education to develop new modeling and simulation degree programs; and

            (C) providing grants for institutions of higher education to enhance existing modeling and simulation degree programs.

        (2) __Definition__ 

            In this section, the term “modeling and simulation” means a field of study related to the application of computer science and mathematics to develop a level of understanding of the interaction of the parts of a system and of a system as a whole.

    (b) __Establishment of task force__ 

        (1) __In general__

            (A) helping to define the study of modeling and simulation (including the content of modeling and simulation classes and programs);

            (B) identifying best practices for such study;

            (C) identifying core knowledge and skills that individuals who participate in modeling and simulation programs should acquire; and

            (D)

             providing recommendations to the Secretary with respect to—

                (i) the information described in subparagraphs (A) through (C); and

                (ii) a system by which grants under this section will be distributed.

        (2) __Task force membership__ 

        The membership of the task force under this subsection shall be composed of representatives from—

            (A) institutions of higher education with established modeling and simulation degree programs;

            (B) the National Science Foundation;

            (C) Federal Government agencies that use modeling and simulation extensively, including the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Transportation;

            (D) private industries with a primary focus on modeling and simulation;

            (E) national modeling and simulation organizations; and

            (F) the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

    (c) __Enhancing modeling and simulation at institutions of higher education__ 

        (1) __Enhancement grants authorized__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary is authorized to award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible institutions to enhance modeling and simulation degree programs at such eligible institutions.

            (B) __Duration of grant__ 

                A grant awarded under this subsection shall be awarded for a three-year period, and such grant period may be extended for not more than two years if the Secretary determines that an eligible institution has demonstrated success in enhancing the modeling and simulation degree program at such eligible institution.

            (C) __Minimum grant amount__ 

                Subject to the availability of appropriations, a grant awarded to an eligible institution under this subsection shall not be less than $750,000.

            (D) __Non-Federal share__ 

                Each eligible institution receiving a grant under this subsection shall provide, from non-Federal sources, in cash or in-kind, an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of the grant to carry out the activities supported by the grant. The Secretary may waive the non-Federal share requirement under this subparagraph for an eligible institution if the Secretary determines a waiver to be appropriate based on the financial ability of the institution.

        (2) __Eligible institutions__ 

        For the purposes of this subsection, an eligible institution is an institution of higher education that—

            (A) has an established modeling and simulation degree program, including a major, minor, or career-track program; or

            (B) has an established modeling and simulation certificate or concentration program.

        (3) __Application__ 

        To be considered for a grant under this subsection, an eligible institution shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. Such application shall include—

            (A) a letter from the president or provost of the eligible institution that demonstrates the institution’s commitment to the enhancement of the modeling and simulation program at the institution of higher education;

            (B) an identification of designated faculty responsible for the enhancement of the institution’s modeling and simulation program; and

            (C) a detailed plan for how the grant funds will be used to enhance the modeling and simulation program of the institution.

        (4) __Uses of funds__ 

        A grant awarded under this subsection shall be used by an eligible institution to carry out the plan developed in accordance with paragraph (3)(C) to enhance modeling and simulation programs at the institution, which may include—

            (A) in the case of an institution that is eligible under paragraph (2)(B), activities to assist in the establishment of a major, minor, or career-track modeling and simulation program at the eligible institution;

            (B) expanding the multidisciplinary nature of the institution’s modeling and simulation programs;

            (C) recruiting students into the field of modeling and simulation through the provision of fellowships or assistantships;

            (D) creating new courses to complement existing courses and reflect emerging developments in the modeling and simulation field;

            (E) conducting research to support new methodologies and techniques in modeling and simulation; and

            (F) purchasing equipment necessary for modeling and simulation programs.
