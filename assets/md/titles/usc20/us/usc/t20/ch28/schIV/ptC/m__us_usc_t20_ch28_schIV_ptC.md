#### Part C—William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program

 __Codification__ 

    This part was, in the original, part D of title IV of [Pub. L. 89–329][/us/pl/89/329], the Higher Education Act of 1965. The letter designation was changed from “D” to “C” for codification purposes. Part C of title IV of [Pub. L. 89–329][/us/pl/89/329], consisting of sections 441 to 447, as added by [Pub. L. 99–498, title IV, § 403(a)][/us/pl/99/498/s403/a], Oct. 17, 1986, [100 Stat. 1429][/us/stat/100/1429], is set out as section 2751 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, because sections 441 to 446 of [Pub. L. 89–329][/us/pl/89/329] had originally been enacted as part C of title I of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, consisting of sections 121 to 126 of [Pub. L. 88–452][/us/pl/88/452], Aug. 20, 1964, [78 Stat. 513][/us/stat/78/513], prior to the transfer of such sections into [Pub. L. 89–329][/us/pl/89/329], and had already been classified to section 2751 et seq. of Title 42 at the time of the transfer.
