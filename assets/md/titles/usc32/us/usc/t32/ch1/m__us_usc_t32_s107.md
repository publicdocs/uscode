In subsection (a), the words “strengths in enlisted members of the active” are substituted for the words “number of enlisted men in active service”. The words between the eighth and ninth semicolons of 32:22, relating to horses and draft animals, are omitted as obsolete, since no animals are now authorized for the National Guard. The words “under [section 106 of this title][/us/usc/t32/s106]” are inserted, since only appropriations under that revised section are required to be apportioned.

    In subsection (b)(1) and (2), the words “actual and” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “Reserve Officers holding commission in the National Guard” are omitted as covered by the words “officers of a \* \* \* reserve component of the Army or the Air Force”. The words “Army General Staff” are substituted for the words “War Department General Staff” to conform to [section 3031(b) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s3031/b].

    In subsection (c), the words “under sections 251 and 252 of title 37” are substituted for the words “provided in [section 19 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s19]”, since allowances for subsistence and quarters are now covered by those sections. The words “shall be paid from appropriations for the National Guard, but not from the allotment of a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone, or the District of Columbia” are substituted for the words “shall constitute a charge against the whole sum annually appropriated for the support of the National Guard, and shall be paid therefrom and not from the allotment duly apportioned for any particular State, Territory, or the District of Columbia”.
