    The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)–(17) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. Where established uses conflict, a choice has been made.

    In clause (1), the definition of “Territory” in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.

    In clause (2), a definition of “National Guard” is inserted for clarity.

In clause (3)(A), the words “a land force” are substituted for 32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, § 117 (last 66 words), [39 Stat. 212][/us/stat/39/212], is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the [act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, § 3][/us/act/1925-02-28/ch374/s3], [43 Stat. 1081][/us/stat/43/1081].

    In clauses (3) and (4), the word “Army” is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.

    In clauses (3) and (5), the words “unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires—” and “as provided in this title”, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.

    In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words “has its officers appointed” are substituted for the word “officered”, in 32:4b.

    In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.

    In clause (5)(A), the words “an air force” are substituted for the words “for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law”, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to Army National Guard), to make the definition of “Air National Guard” parallel with the definition of “Army National Guard”, and to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.

    In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are inserted to make clear that enlistment is not the only method of becoming a member in an enlisted grade.

    In clause (2), the term “armed forces” is defined for legislative convenience and is defined the same as that term is defined in [section 101(4) of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s101/4], United States Code.

    The definition in clause (18) reflects the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the term has been commonly used.

>     “(a) __Findings.—__ 

>     Congress makes the following findings:

>         “(1) In 1629, Captain John Endicott organized the first militia in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Salem.

>         “(2) The colonists had adopted the English militia system, which required all males between the ages of 16 and 60 to possess arms and participate in the defense of the community.

>         “(3) In 1636, the Massachusetts General Court ordered the organization of three militia regiments, designated as the North, South, and East regiments.

>         “(4) These regiments drilled once a week and provided guard details each evening to sound the alarm in case of attack.

>         “(5) The East Regiment, the predecessor of the 101st Engineer Battalion, assembled as a regiment for the first time in 1637 on the Salem Common, marking the beginning of the Massachusetts National Guard and the National Guard of the United States.

>         “(6) Since 1785, Salem’s own Second Corps of Cadets (101st and 102nd Field Artillery) has celebrated the anniversary of that first muster.

>         “(7) As the policy contained in [section 102 of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s102], United States Code, clearly expresses, the National Guard continues its historic mission of providing units for the first line defense of the United States and current missions throughout the world.

>         “(8) The designation of the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States will contribute positively to tourism and economic development in the city, create jobs, and instill pride in both the local and State communities.

>     “(b) __Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as National Guard Birthplace.—__ 

>     In light of the findings made in subsection (a), the City of Salem, Massachusetts, is hereby designated as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.

>     “(c) __Responsibilities.—__ 

>         “(1) __Military ceremonial support.—__ 

>         The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Council of Governors, and the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts, shall provide military ceremonial support at the dedication of any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.

>         “(2) __Funding source.—__ 

>         Federal funds may not be used to design, procure, prepare, install, or maintain any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States, but the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts may accept and expend contributions of non-Federal funds for this purpose.”
