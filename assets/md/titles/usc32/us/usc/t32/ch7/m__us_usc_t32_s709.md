    In subsection (a), the words “may be spent” are substituted for the words “shall be available”.

The word “persons” is substituted for the word “help”. The words “Army National Guard” and “Air National Guard” are substituted for the words “organizations of all kinds”. The words “the support of” are omitted as surplusage.
