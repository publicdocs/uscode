    In subsection (a), the definition of the term “Department”, in 37:361, is omitted as unnecessary, since the particular departments referred to are spelled out in the revised text. The definition of the term “uniformed services”, in 37:361, is omitted as covered by the word “member” in this revised section. Clauses (1)–(6) are substituted for the last 5 clauses of 37:362. The words “regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned” are substituted for the words “regulations of the Department concerned”, since the “Department”, as such, cannot issue regulations.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “Surviving spouse” are substituted for the words “widow or widower”. As defined in [section 101(18) of this title][/us/usc/t32/s101/18], “spouse” includes a widower.

    In subsection (b), the words “are subject to” are substituted for the words “shall be made under”.

    In subsection (c), the word “Under” is substituted for the words “Subject to”. The words “rules and” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 104–316][/us/pl/104/316], in first sentence, substituted “Secretary concerned” for “Comptroller General” and struck out at end “Payment under clause (6) of subsection (a) shall be made—

    “(1) upon settlement by the General Accounting Office; or

    “(2) as otherwise authorized by the Comptroller General.”

    1961—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 87–46][/us/pl/87/46] substituted “Payment under clause (6) of subsection (a) shall be made—

    “(1) upon settlement by the General Accounting Office; or

    “(2) as otherwise authorized by the Comptroller General.”

    for “Payments under clauses (2)–(6) of subsection (a) may be paid only after settlement by the General Accounting Office.”

 __Designation of Beneficiary Made Before January 1, 1956__ 

    Designation of beneficiary made before Jan. 1, 1956, considered as the designation of a beneficiary for the purposes of this section, see note set out under [section 2771 of Title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2771], Armed Forces.
