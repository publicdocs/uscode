    Subsection (a) is substituted for 32:154 (last par., less 1st 26, and last 26, words) to reflect an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953).

    In subsection (b), the words “is entitled to a discharge certificate similar in form and classification to the corresponding certificate” are substituted for the words “shall receive a discharge in writing in such form and with such classification as is or shall be”. The words “service in” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), the words “his enlistment expires” are substituted for the words “the expiration of terms of enlistment”.
