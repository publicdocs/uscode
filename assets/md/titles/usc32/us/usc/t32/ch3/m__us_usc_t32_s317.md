## § 317. Command during joint exercises with Federal troops

    When any part of the National Guard that is not in Federal service participates in an encampment, maneuver, or other exercise for instruction, together with troops in Federal service, the command of the post, air base, or other place where it is held, and of the troops in Federal service on duty there, remains with the officers in Federal service who command that place and the Federal troops on duty there, without regard to the rank of the officers of the National Guard not in Federal service who are temporarily participating in the exercise.

([Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 605][/us/stat/70A/605].)

    The words “not in Federal service” are inserted to show that the revised section applies only to joint exercises involving National Guard troops not in Federal service, since 32:72 was enacted before the establishment of the National Guard of the United States, in 1933. The words “troops in Federal service” are substituted for the words “troops of the United States”. The words “officers in Federal service who command” are substituted for the words “commander of the United States troops”. The words “post, air base, or other place” are substituted for the words “military post, or reservation, or elsewhere”. The words “that place and the Federal troops on duty there” are substituted for the words “there or elsewhere” The words “including outdoor target practice” and “field and coast defense instruction” are omitted as surplusage.

 __Usual and Customary Arrangement__
