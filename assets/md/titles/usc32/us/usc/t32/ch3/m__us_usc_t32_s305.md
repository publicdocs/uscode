    The words “June 4, 1920” are omitted as obsolete. The words “Only persons selected from the following categories are eligible for individual Federal recognition as commissioned officers” are substituted for the words “Persons commissioned \* \* \* shall not be recognized as such under any of the provisions of this title unless they shall have been selected from the following classes”.

    In clause (4), the words “under honorable conditions” are inserted for clarity.
