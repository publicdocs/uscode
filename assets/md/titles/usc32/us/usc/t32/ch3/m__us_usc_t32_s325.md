In subsection (a), the words “in the service of the United States” are omitted as surplusage. The words “effective date of his order to active duty until he is relieved from that duty” are substituted for the words “active-duty date of the orders and for as long as they remain on active duty in the service of the United States”. 50:1120 (last sentence) is omitted as surplusage, since the persons involved are members of the Army or the Air Force.

    In subsection (b), the words “upon relief from that duty” are substituted for the words “upon being relieved from active duty”. The words “their National Guard status” are substituted for the words “to the National Guard and Air National Guard in their respective States, Territories, and the District of Columbia”.
