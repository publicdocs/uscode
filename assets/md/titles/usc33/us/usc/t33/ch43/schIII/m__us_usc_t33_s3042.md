## § 3042. Separation pay

    (a) __Authorization of payment__ 

        An officer who is separated under [section 3041(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3041/a/2] and who has completed more than three years of continuous active service immediately before that separation is entitled to separation pay computed under subsection (b) of this section unless the Secretary determines that the conditions under which the officer is separated do not warrant payment of that pay.

    (b) __Amount of separation pay__ 

        (1) __Six or more years__ 

        In the case of an officer who has completed six or more years of continuous active service immediately before that separation, the amount of separation pay to be paid to the officer under this section is 10 percent of the product of—

            (A) the years of active service creditable to the officer; and

            (B) 12 times the monthly basic pay to which the officer was entitled at the time of separation.

        (2) __Three to six years__ 

            In the case of an officer who has completed three or more but fewer than six years of continuous active service immediately before that separation, the amount of separation pay to be paid to the officer under this section is one-half of the amount computed under paragraph (1).

    (c) __Other conditions, requirements, and administrative provisions__ 

        The provisions of subsections (f), (g), and (h) of [section 1174 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s1174] shall apply to separation pay under this section in the same manner as such provisions apply to separation pay under that section.
