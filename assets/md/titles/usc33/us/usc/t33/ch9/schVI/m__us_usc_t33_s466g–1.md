    (a) __Jurisdiction of actions by States__ 

    The United States district courts shall have original jurisdiction (concurrent with that of the Supreme Court of the United States, and concurrent with that of any other court of the United States or of any State of the United States in matters in which the Supreme Court, or any other court, has original jurisdiction) of any case or controversy—

        (1) which involves the construction or application of an interstate compact which (A) in whole or in part relates to the pollution of the waters of an interstate river system or any portion thereof, and (B) expresses the consent of the States signatory to said compact to be sued in a district court in any case or controversy involving the application or construction thereof; and

        (2) which involves pollution of the waters of such river system, or any portion thereof, alleged to be in violation of the provisions of said compact; and

        (3) in which one or more of the States signatory to said compact is a plaintiff or plaintiffs; and

        (4) which is within the judicial power of the United States as set forth in the Constitution of the United States.

    (b) __Amount in controversy; residence, situs or citizenship; nature, character, or legal status of parties__ 

        The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of a case or controversy such as is referred to in subsection (a) of this section, without any requirement, limitation, or regard as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy, or of the place of residence or situs or citizenship, or of the nature, character, or legal status, of any of the proper parties plaintiff or defendant in said case or controversy other than the signatory State or States plaintiff or plaintiffs referred to in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section: Provided, That nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing a State to sue its own citizens in said courts.

    (c) __Suits between States signatory to interstate compact__ 

        The original jurisdiction conferred upon the district courts by this section shall include, but not be limited to, suits between States signatory to such interstate compact: Provided, That nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing a State to sue another State which is not a signatory to such compact in said courts.

    (d) __Venue__ 

        The venue of such case or controversy shall be as prescribed by law: Provided, That in addition thereto, such case or controversy may be brought in in any judicial district in which the acts of pollution complained of, or any portion thereof, occur, regardless of the place or places of residence, or situs, of any of the parties plaintiff or defendant.
