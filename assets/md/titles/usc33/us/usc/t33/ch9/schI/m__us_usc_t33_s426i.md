        The Secretary of the Army is authorized to investigate, study, plan, and implement structural and nonstructural measures for the prevention or mitigation of shore damages attributable to Federal navigation works and shore damage attributable to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, if a non-Federal public body agrees to operate and maintain such measures, and, in the case of interests in real property acquired in conjunction with nonstructural measures, to operate and maintain the property for public purposes in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (b) __Cost sharing__ 

        The costs of implementing measures under this section shall be cost-shared in the same proportion as the cost-sharing provisions applicable to the project causing the shore damage.

    (c) __Requirement for specific authorization__ 

        No such project shall be initiated without specific authorization by Congress if the Federal first cost exceeds $5,000,000.

    (d) __Coordination__ 

    The Secretary shall—

        (1) coordinate the implementation of the measures under this section with other Federal and non-Federal shore protection projects in the same geographic area; and

        (2) to the extent practicable, combine mitigation projects with other shore protection projects in the same area into a comprehensive regional project.
