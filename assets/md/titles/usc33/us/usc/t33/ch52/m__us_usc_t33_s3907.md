    (a) __Eligibility requirements__ 

    To be eligible to receive financial assistance under this chapter, a project shall meet the following criteria, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, as applicable:

        (1) __Creditworthiness__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The project and obligor shall be creditworthy, which shall be determined by the Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable.

            (B) __Considerations__ 

            In determining the creditworthiness of a project and obligor, the Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall take into consideration relevant factors, including—

                (i) the terms, conditions, financial structure, and security features of the proposed financing;

                (ii) the dedicated revenue sources that will secure or fund the project obligations;

                (iii) the financial assumptions upon which the project is based; and

                (iv) the financial soundness and credit history of the obligor.

            (C) __Security features__ 

                The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall ensure that any financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, supporting the project obligations to ensure repayment.

            (D) __Rating opinion letters__ 

                (i) __Preliminary rating opinion letter__ 

                    The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall require each project applicant to provide, at the time of application, a preliminary rating opinion letter from at least 1 rating agency indicating that the senior obligations of the project (which may be the Federal credit instrument) have the potential to achieve an investment-grade rating.

                (ii) __Final rating opinion letters__ 

                    The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall require each project applicant to provide, prior to final acceptance and financing of the project, final rating opinion letters from at least 2 rating agencies indicating that the senior obligations of the project have an investment-grade rating.

            (E) __Special rule for certain combined projects__ 

                The Administrator shall develop a credit evaluation process for a Federal credit instrument provided to a State infrastructure financing authority for a project under [section 3905(8) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3905/8] or an entity for a project under [section 3905(9) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3905/9], which may include requiring the provision of a final rating opinion letter from at least 2 rating agencies.

        (2) __Eligible project costs__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the eligible project costs of a project shall be reasonably anticipated to be not less than $20,000,000.

            (B) __Small community water infrastructure projects__ 

                For a project described in paragraph (2) or (3) of [section 3905 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3905] that serves a community of not more than 25,000 individuals, the eligible project costs of a project shall be reasonably anticipated to be not less than $5,000,000.

        (3) __Dedicated revenue sources__ 

            The Federal credit instrument for the project shall be repayable, in whole or in part, from dedicated revenue sources that also secure the project obligations.

        (4) __Public sponsorship of private entities__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If an eligible project is carried out by an entity that is not a State or local government or an agency or instrumentality of a State or local government or a tribal government or consortium of tribal governments, the project shall be publicly sponsored.

            (B) __Public sponsorship__ 

                For purposes of this chapter, a project shall be considered to be publicly sponsored if the obligor can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary or the Administrator, as appropriate, that the project applicant has consulted with the affected State, local, or tribal government in which the project is located, or is otherwise affected by the project, and that such government supports the proposed project.

        (5) __Use of existing financing mechanisms__ 

            (A) __Notification__ 

                For each eligible project for which the Administrator has authority under paragraph (2) or (3) of [section 3902(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3902/b] and for which the Administrator has received an application for financial assistance under this chapter, the Administrator shall notify, not later than 30 days after the date on which the Administrator receives a complete application, the applicable State infrastructure financing authority of the State in which the project is located that such application has been submitted.

            (B) __Determination__ 

            If, not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a notification under subparagraph (A), a State infrastructure financing authority notifies the Administrator that the State infrastructure financing authority intends to commit funds to the project in an amount that is equal to or greater than the amount requested under the application, the Administrator may not provide any financial assistance for that project under this chapter unless—

                (i) by the date that is 180 days after the date of receipt of a notification under subparagraph (A), the State infrastructure financing authority fails to enter into an assistance agreement to provide funds for the project; or

                (ii) the financial assistance to be provided by the State infrastructure financing authority will be at rates and terms that are less favorable than the rates and terms for financial assistance provided under this chapter.

        (6) __Operation and maintenance plan__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall determine whether an applicant for assistance under this chapter has developed, and identified adequate revenues to implement, a plan for operating, maintaining, and repairing the project over the useful life of the project.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

                An eligible project described in [section 3905(1) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3905/1] that has not been specifically authorized by Congress shall not be eligible for Federal assistance for operations and maintenance.
