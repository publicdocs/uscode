## § 3843. EPA enforcement

    (a) __Inspections, subpoenas__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of enforcing this chapter or any regulation prescribed under this chapter, officers or employees of the Environmental Protection Agency or of any State designated by the Administrator may enter at reasonable times any location where there is being held or may be held organotin or any other substance or antifouling system regulated under the Convention, for the purpose of inspecting and obtaining samples of any containers or labeling for organotin or other substance or system regulated under the Convention.

        (2) __Subpoenas__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In any investigation under this section, the Administrator may issue a subpoena to require the attendance of a witness or the production of documents or other evidence if—

                (i) before the issuance of the subpoena, the Administrator requests a determination by the Attorney General of the United States as to whether the subpoena will interfere with a criminal investigation; and

                (ii)

                 the Attorney General—

                    (I) determines that the subpoena will not interfere with a criminal investigation; or

                    (II) fails to make a determination under subclause (I) before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the Administrator makes a request under clause (i).

            (B) __Enforcement__ 

                In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person under this paragraph, the Administrator may request the Attorney General to invoke the aid of the appropriate district court of the United States to compel compliance.

    (b) __Stop manufacture, sale, use, or removal orders__ 

        Consistent with [section 3803 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3803], whenever any organotin or other substance or system regulated under the Convention is found by the Administrator and there is reason to believe that a manufacturer, seller, distributor, or user has violated or is in violation of any provision of this chapter, or that such organotin or other substance or system regulated under the Convention has been or is intended to be manufactured, distributed, sold, or used in violation of this chapter, the Administrator may issue a stop manufacture, sale, use, or removal order to any person that owns, controls, or has custody of such organotin or other substance or system regulated under the Convention. After receipt of that order the person may not manufacture, sell, distribute, use, or remove the organotin or other substance or system regulated under the Convention described in the order except in accordance with the order.
