            (A) location information of all Federal levees in the Nation (including global information system information) and updated levee information provided by States, Indian tribes, Federal agencies, and other entities;

            (B) utilizing such information as is available, the general condition of each levee; and

            (C) an estimate of the number of structures and population at risk and protected by each levee that would be adversely impacted if the levee fails or water levels exceed the height of the levee.

        (3) __Availability of information__ 

            (A) __Availability to Federal, State, and local governmental agencies__ 

                The Secretary shall make all of the information in the database available to appropriate Federal, State, and local governmental agencies.

    (b) __Inventory and inspection of levees__ 

        (1) __Federal levees__

        (2) __Federally constructed, nonfederally operated and maintained levees__ 

            The Secretary shall establish an inventory and conduct an inspection of all federally constructed, non-federally operated and maintained levees, at the original cost share for the project.

        (3) __Participating levees__ 

            For non-Federal levees the owners of which are participating in the emergency response to natural disasters program established under [section 701n of this title][/us/usc/t33/s701n], the Secretary shall establish an inventory and conduct an inspection of each such levee if the owner of the levee requests such inspection.

            The Secretary shall carry out a one-time inventory and review of all levees identified in the national levee database.

        (3) __Review criteria__ 

            In carrying out the inventory and review, the Secretary shall use the levee safety action classification criteria to determine whether a levee should be classified in the inventory as requiring a more comprehensive inspection.

            (A) allow an official of the State or Indian tribe to participate in the review of the levee; and

            (B) provide information to the State or Indian tribe relating to the location, construction, operation, or maintenance of the levee.
