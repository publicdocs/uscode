## § 3425. Competitiveness

    (a) __Discretionary fund__ 

        The Program shall allocate no more than 10 percent of its annual budget to a discretionary fund that may be used only for program administration and priority undersea research projects identified by the Director but not covered by funding available from centers.

    (b) __Competitive selection__ 

        The Administrator shall conduct an initial competition to select the regional centers that will participate in the program 90 days after the publication of the final program direction under [section 3423 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3423] and every 5 years thereafter.
