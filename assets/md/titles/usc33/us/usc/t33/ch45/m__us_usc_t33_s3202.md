## § 3202. Purposes

The purposes of this chapter are—

    (1) to improve tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, notification, outreach, and mitigation to protect life and property in the United States;

    (2) to enhance and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms, and increase the accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and to expand detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable States and United States territories, including the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico areas;

    (3) to improve mapping, modeling, research, and assessment efforts to improve tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, notification, outreach, mitigation, response, and recovery;

    (4) to improve and increase education and outreach activities and ensure that those receiving tsunami warnings and the at-risk public know what to do when a tsunami is approaching;

    (5) to provide technical and other assistance to speed international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian Ocean; and

    (6) to improve Federal, State, and international coordination for detection, warnings, and outreach for tsunami and other coastal impacts.
