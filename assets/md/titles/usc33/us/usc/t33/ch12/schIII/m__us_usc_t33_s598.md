## § 598. Resettlement of displaced families, individuals, and business concerns

    (a) __Acquisition of land; condemnation expenses; bond__ 

        Whenever any State, or any agency or instrumentality of a State or local government, or any nonprofit incorporated body organized or chartered under the law of the State in which it is located, or any nonprofit association or combination of such bodies, agencies or instrumentalities, shall undertake to secure any lands or interests therein as a site for the resettlement of families, individuals, and business concerns displaced by a river and harbor improvement, flood control or other water resource project duly authorized by Congress, and when it has been determined by the Secretary of the Army that the State is unable to acquire necessary lands or interests in lands or is unable to acquire such lands or interests in lands with sufficient promptness, the Secretary, upon the request of the Governor of the State in which such site is located, and after consultation with appropriate Federal, State, interstate, regional, and local departments and agencies, is authorized, in the name of the United States and prior to the approval of title by the Attorney General, to acquire, enter upon, and take possession of such lands or interests in lands by purchase, donation, condemnation or otherwise in accordance with the laws of the United States (including sections 3114–3116 and 3118 of title 40). All expenses of said acquisition and any award that may be made under a condemnation proceeding, including costs of examination and abstract of title, certificate of title, appraisal, advertising, and any fees incident to acquisition, shall be paid by such State or body, agency, or instrumentality. The State, agency, instrumentality, or nonprofit body may repay such amounts from any funds made available to it for such purposes by any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality (other than the Department of the Army) having authority to make funds available for such a purpose. Pending such payment, the Secretary may expend from any funds hereafter appropriated for the project occasioning such acquisition such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section. To secure payment, the Secretary may require any such State or agency, body, or instrumentality to execute a proper bond in such amount as he may deem necessary before acquisition is commenced. Any sums paid to the Secretary by any such State or agency, body or instrumentality shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the appropriation for such project.

    (b) __Acquisition provisions__ 

        No acquisition shall be undertaken under the authority of this section unless the Secretary has determined, after consultation with appropriate Federal, State, and local governmental agencies that (1) the development of a site is necessary in order to alleviate hardships to displaced persons; (2) the location of the site is suitable for development in relation to present or potential sources of employment; and (3) a plan for development of the site has been approved by appropriate local governmental authorities in the area or community in which such site is located.

    (c) __Conveyance to State, public or private nonprofit body__ 

        The Secretary is further authorized and directed by proper deed, executed in the name of the United States, to convey any lands or interests in land acquired in any State under the provisions of this section, to the State, or such public or private nonprofit body, agency, or institution in the State as the Governor may prescribe, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary, the Governor, and the agency to which the conveyance is to be made.
