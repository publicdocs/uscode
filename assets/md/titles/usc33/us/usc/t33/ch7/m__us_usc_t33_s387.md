## § 387. Duties of officers of customs and marshals as to seizure

    The collectors of the several ports of entry, the surveyors of the several ports of delivery, and the marshals of the several judicial districts within the United States, shall seize any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentioned in [section 385 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s385], which may be found within their respective ports or districts, and to cause the same to be proceeded against and disposed of as provided by that section.

(R.S. § 4299.)

 __References in Text__ 

    Surveyors of the several ports of delivery, referred to in text, are probably obsolete offices in view of [act July 5, 1932, ch. 430][/us/act/1932-07-05/ch430], title I, § 1, [47 Stat. 584][/us/stat/47/584], which abolished the offices of surveyors of customs, except at the Port of New York. Ports of delivery, except those which were made ports of entry, were abolished and the use of the term “port of delivery” was discontinued under the President’s plan of reorganization of the customs service communicated to Congress by message dated Mar. 3, 1913.

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 4299 derived from [act Aug. 5, 1861, ch. 48, § 3][/us/act/1861-08-05/ch48/s3], [12 Stat. 315][/us/stat/12/315].

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    All offices of collector of customs, comptroller of customs, surveyor of customs, and appraiser of merchandise in Bureau of Customs of Department of the Treasury to which appointments were required to be made by President with advice and consent of Senate ordered abolished, with such offices to be terminated not later than December 31, 1966, by Reorg.
