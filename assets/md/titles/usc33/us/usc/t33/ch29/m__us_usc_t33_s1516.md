## § 1516. Judicial review; persons aggrieved; jurisdiction of courts of appeal

    Any person suffering legal wrong, or who is adversely affected or aggrieved by the Secretary’s decision to issue, transfer, modify, renew, suspend, or revoke a license may, not later than 60 days after any such decision is made, seek judicial review of such decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit within which the nearest adjacent coastal State is located. A person shall be deemed to be aggrieved by the Secretary’s decision within the meaning of this chapter if he—

    (A) has participated in the administrative proceedings before the Secretary (or if he did not so participate, he can show that his failure to do so was caused by the Secretary’s failure to provide the required notice); and

    (B) is adversely affected by the Secretary’s action.
