## § 1505. Environmental review criteria

    (a) __Establishment; evaluation of proposed deepwater ports__ 

    The Secretary, in accordance with the recommendations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and after consultation with any other Federal departments and agencies having jurisdiction over any aspect of the construction or operation of a deepwater port, shall establish, as soon as practicable after January 3, 1975, environmental review criteria consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act \[[42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.\]. Such criteria shall be used to evaluate a deepwater port as proposed in an application, including—

        (1) the effect on the marine environment;

        (2) the effect on oceanographic currents and wave patterns;

        (3) the effect on alternate uses of the oceans and navigable waters, such as scientific study, fishing, and exploitation of other living and nonliving resources;

        (4) the potential dangers to a deepwater port from waves, winds, weather, and geological conditions, and the steps which can be taken to protect against or minimize such dangers;

        (5) effects of land-based developments related to deepwater port development;

        (6) the effect on human health and welfare; and

        (7) such other considerations as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.

    (b) __Review and revision__ 

        The Secretary shall periodically review and, whenever necessary, revise in the same manner as originally developed, criteria established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Concurrent development of criteria and regulations__ 

        Criteria established pursuant to this section shall be developed concurrently with the regulations in subsection (a) of [section 1504 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1504] and in accordance with the provisions of that subsection.
