        (2) the establishment of an oil spill removal organization at appropriate locations in Prince William Sound, consisting of trained personnel in sufficient numbers to immediately remove, to the maximum extent practicable, a worst case discharge or a discharge of 200,000 barrels of oil, whichever is greater;

        (3) training in oil removal techniques for local residents and individuals engaged in the cultivation or production of fish or fish products in Prince William Sound;

 __References in Text__ 

    The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, referred to in subsec. (a), is title II of [Pub. L. 93–153][/us/pl/93/153], Nov. 16, 1973, [87 Stat. 584][/us/stat/87/584], which is classified generally to chapter 34 (§ 1651 et seq.) of Title 43, Public Lands. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1651 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1651] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1992—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 102–388][/us/pl/102/388] substituted “tanker loading cargo at” for “tank vessel operating on Prince William Sound, or” and directed the insertion of “and a response plan for such a facility,” after “([43 U.S.C. 1651][/us/usc/t43/s1651] et seq.).”, which was executed by making the insertion after “([43 U.S.C. 1651][/us/usc/t43/s1651] et seq.),” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
