## § 2702. Elements of liability

    (a) __In general__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject to the provisions of this Act, each responsible party for a vessel or a facility from which oil is discharged, or which poses the substantial threat of a discharge of oil, into or upon the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone is liable for the removal costs and damages specified in subsection (b) of this section that result from such incident.

    (b) __Covered removal costs and damages__ 

        (1) __Removal costs__ 

        The removal costs referred to in subsection (a) of this section are—

            (A) all removal costs incurred by the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe under subsection (c), (d), (e), or (l) of [section 1321 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1321], under the Intervention on the High Seas Act ([33 U.S.C. 1471][/us/usc/t33/s1471] et seq.), or under State law; and

            (B) any removal costs incurred by any person for acts taken by the person which are consistent with the National Contingency Plan.

        (2) __Damages__ 

        The damages referred to in subsection (a) of this section are the following:

            (A) __Natural resources__ 

                Damages for injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing the damage, which shall be recoverable by a United States trustee, a State trustee, an Indian tribe trustee, or a foreign trustee.

            (B) __Real or personal property__ 

                Damages for injury to, or economic losses resulting from destruction of, real or personal property, which shall be recoverable by a claimant who owns or leases that property.

            (C) __Subsistence use__ 

                Damages for loss of subsistence use of natural resources, which shall be recoverable by any claimant who so uses natural resources which have been injured, destroyed, or lost, without regard to the ownership or management of the resources.

            (D) __Revenues__ 

                Damages equal to the net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, or net profit shares due to the injury, destruction, or loss of real property, personal property, or natural resources, which shall be recoverable by the Government of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof.

            (E) __Profits and earning capacity__ 

                Damages equal to the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to the injury, destruction, or loss of real property, personal property, or natural resources, which shall be recoverable by any claimant.

            (F) __Public services__ 

                Damages for net costs of providing increased or additional public services during or after removal activities, including protection from fire, safety, or health hazards, caused by a discharge of oil, which shall be recoverable by a State, or a political subdivision of a State.

    (c) __Excluded discharges__ 

    This subchapter does not apply to any discharge—

        (1) permitted by a permit issued under Federal, State, or local law;

        (2) from a public vessel; or

        (3) from an onshore facility which is subject to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act ([43 U.S.C. 1651][/us/usc/t43/s1651] et seq.).

    (d) __Liability of third parties__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Third party treated as responsible party__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in any case in which a responsible party establishes that a discharge or threat of a discharge and the resulting removal costs and damages were caused solely by an act or omission of one or more third parties described in [section 2703(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2703/a/3] (or solely by such an act or omission in combination with an act of God or an act of war), the third party or parties shall be treated as the responsible party or parties for purposes of determining liability under this subchapter.

            (B) __Subrogation of responsible party__ 

            If the responsible party alleges that the discharge or threat of a discharge was caused solely by an act or omission of a third party, the responsible party—

                (i) in accordance with [section 2713 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2713], shall pay removal costs and damages to any claimant; and

                (ii) shall be entitled by subrogation to all rights of the United States Government and the claimant to recover removal costs or damages from the third party or the Fund paid under this subsection.

        (2) __Limitation applied__ 

            (A) __Owner or operator of vessel or facility__ 

                If the act or omission of a third party that causes an incident occurs in connection with a vessel or facility owned or operated by the third party, the liability of the third party shall be subject to the limits provided in [section 2704 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2704] as applied with respect to the vessel or facility.

            (B) __Other cases__ 

                In any other case, the liability of a third party or parties shall not exceed the limitation which would have been applicable to the responsible party of the vessel or facility from which the discharge actually occurred if the responsible party were liable.
