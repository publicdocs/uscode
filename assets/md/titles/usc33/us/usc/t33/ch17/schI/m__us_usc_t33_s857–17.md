 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Provisions similar to those contained in this section, which required the designation of senior policy officials as observers, directed the Secretary of Commerce to provide administrative assistance, and authorized requests for assistance from Federal agencies by the Federal Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere as originally established on Aug. 16, 1971, were contained in sections 857–8 and 857–11 of this title prior to repeal by [section 7(a) of Pub. L. 95–63][/us/pl/95/63/s7/a].
