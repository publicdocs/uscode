## § 857–16. Compensation and travel expenses

    Members of the Committee shall each be entitled to receive compensation not to exceed the daily rate for a GS–18 for each day (including traveltime) during which they are engaged in the actual performance of the duties of the Committee. In addition, while away from their homes or regular places of business in the performance of the duties of the Committee, each member of the Committee shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in the same manner as persons employed intermittently in the Government service are allowed expenses under section 5703(b)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 5.

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 5703 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5703], referred to in text, was amended generally by [Pub. L. 94–22, § 4][/us/pl/94/22/s4], May 19, 1975, [89 Stat. 85][/us/stat/89/85], and, as so amended, does not contain a subsec. (b).

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A provision similar to that contained in this section, which authorized compensation and travel expenses for members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere as originally established on Aug. 16, 1971, was contained in [section 857–10 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s857–10] prior to repeal by [section 7(a) of Pub.

 __Amendments__ 

    1981—[Pub. L. 97–87][/us/pl/97/87] substituted “not to exceed the daily rate for a GS–18” for “of $100 per day”.

 __Termination of Advisory Committees__ 

    Advisory committees established after Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of their establishment, unless, in the case of a committee established by the President or an officer of the Federal Government, such committee is renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a committee established by the Congress, its duration is otherwise provided for by law. See [section 14 of Pub. L. 92–463][/us/pl/92/463/s14], Oct. 6, 1972, [86 Stat. 776][/us/stat/86/776], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
