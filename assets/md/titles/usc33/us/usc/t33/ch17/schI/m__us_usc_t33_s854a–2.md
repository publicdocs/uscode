## § 854a–2. Pay and allowances; date of acceptance of promotion

    Any commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration promoted to a higher grade at any time after December 7, 1941, shall be deemed for all purposes to have accepted his promotion to higher grade upon the date such promotion is made by the President unless he shall expressly decline such promotion, and shall receive the pay and allowances of the higher grade from such date unless he is entitled under some other provision of law to receive the pay and allowances of the higher grade from an earlier date. No such officer who shall have subscribed to the oath of office required by [section 3331 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3331], shall be required to renew such oath or to take a new oath upon his promotion to a higher grade, if his service after the taking of such an oath shall have been continuous.

 __Codification__ 

    “[Section 3331 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3331]” substituted in text for “section 1757, Revised Statutes” on authority of [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], § 7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 631][/us/stat/80/631], the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Section 1757 of the Revised Statutes had been classified to section 16 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.

    Provisions similar to this section are contained in [section 3031 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s3031].

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    Coast and Geodetic Survey consolidated with Weather Bureau to form a new agency in Department of Commerce to be known as Environmental Science Services Administration, and commissioned officers of Survey transferred to ESSA, by Reorg.

Plan also transferred to Secretary of Commerce all functions of Coast and Geodetic Survey and Director of Survey. Subsequently, Environmental Science Services Administration abolished, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration established, and Commissioned Officer Corps of ESSA redesignated Commissioned Officer Corps of NOAA by Reorg. Plan No. 4 of 1970, eff. Oct. 3, 1970, 35 F.R. 15627, [84 Stat. 2090][/us/stat/84/2090], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
