## § 2102. Establishment of standards

    Based on the best scientific information available, artificial reefs in waters covered under this chapter shall be sited and constructed, and subsequently monitored and managed in a manner which will—

    (1) enhance fishery resources to the maximum extent practicable;

    (2) facilitate access and utilization by United States recreational and commercial fishermen;

    (3) minimize conflicts among competing uses of waters covered under this chapter and the resources in such waters;

    (4) minimize environmental risks and risks to personal health and property; and

    (5) be consistent with generally accepted principles of international law and shall not create any unreasonable obstruction to navigation.
