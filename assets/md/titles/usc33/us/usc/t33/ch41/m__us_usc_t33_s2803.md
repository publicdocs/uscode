    (b) __Program elements__ 

    The Comprehensive Coastal Water Quality Monitoring Program shall include, but not be limited to—

        (1)

         identification and analysis of the status of environmental quality in the Nation’s coastal ecosystems, including but not limited to, assessment of—

            (A) ambient water quality, including contaminant levels in relation to criteria and standards issued pursuant to title III or  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

            (B)

             establish scientifically valid monitoring methods that will—

                (i) provide simplified methods to survey and assess the water quality and ecological health of coastal waters;

                (ii) identify and quantify through more intensive efforts the severity of existing or anticipated problems in selected coastal waters;

                (iii) identify and quantify sources of pollution that cause or contribute to those problems, including point and nonpoint sources; and

                (iv) evaluate over time the effectiveness of efforts to reduce or eliminate pollution from those sources;

            (C) provide for data compatibility to enable data to be efficiently stored and shared by various users; and

            (D) identify appropriate physical, chemical, and biological indicators of the health and quality of coastal ecosystems.

        (2) __Technical protocols__ 

        Guidelines issued under paragraph (1) shall include protocols for—

            (A) designing statistically valid coastal water quality monitoring networks and monitoring surveys, including assessment of the accumulation of floatables.2

            (B) sampling and analysis, including appropriate physical and chemical parameters, living resource parameters, and sediment analysis techniques; and

            (C) quality control, quality assessment, and data consistency and management.

        (3) __Periodic review__ 

            The Administrator and the Under Secretary shall periodically review the guidelines and protocols issued under this subsection to evaluate their effectiveness, the degree to which they continue to answer program objectives and provide an appropriate degree of uniformity while taking local conditions into account, and any need to modify or supplement them with new guidelines and protocols, as needed.

        (4) __Discharge permit data__ 

            The Administrator or a State permitting authority shall ensure that compliance monitoring conducted pursuant to section 402(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ([33 U.S.C. 1342(a)(2)][/us/usc/t33/s1342/a/2]) for permits for discharges to coastal waters is consistent with the guidelines issued under this subsection. Any modifications of discharge permits necessary to implement this subsection shall be deemed to be minor modifications of such permit. Nothing in this subsection requires dischargers to conduct monitoring other than compliance monitoring pursuant to permits under section 402(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ([33 U.S.C. 1342(a)(2)][/us/usc/t33/s1342/a/2]).

In identifying these coastal areas, the National Research Council shall consider areas that—

                (i) are representatives of coastal ecosystems throughout the United States;

                (ii) will provide information to assess the status and trends of coastal water quality nation-wide; and

                (iii) would benefit from intensive water quality monitoring because of local management needs.

            (B) In making recommendations under this paragraph, the National Research Council shall consult with Regional Research Boards established pursuant to title IV of this Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1447][/us/usc/t16/s1447] et seq.\].
