        The term “covered data” means, with respect to a named storm identified by the Administrator under subsection (b)(2)(A), empirical data that are—

            (A) collected before, during, or after such storm; and

            (B) necessary to determine magnitude and timing of wind speeds, rainfall, the barometric pressure, river flows, the extent, height, and timing of storm surge, topographic and bathymetric data, and other measures required to accurately model and assess damage from such storm.

        (5) __Indeterminate loss__ 

            The term “indeterminate loss” has the meaning given the term in [section 4057(a) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s4057/a].

        (7) __Named Storm Event Model__ 

            The term “Named Storm Event Model” means the official meteorological and oceanographic computerized model, developed by the Administrator under subsection (b)(1)(A), which utilizes covered data to replicate the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with named storms that threaten any portion of a coastal State.

        (9) __Post-storm assessment__ 

            The term “post-storm assessment” means a scientific assessment produced and certified by the Administrator to determine the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with a specific named storm to be used in the COASTAL Formula.

        (10) __State__ 

            The term “State” means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States.

            (B) __Accuracy__ 

                The Named Storm Event Model shall be designed to generate post-storm assessments, as provided in paragraph (2), that have a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent for every indeterminate loss for which a post-storm assessment is utilized.

        (2) __Post-storm assessment__ 

            (A) __Identification of named storms threatening coastal States__ 

                After the establishment of the COASTAL Formula, the Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, identify named storms that may reasonably constitute a threat to any portion of a coastal State.

            (B) __Post-storm assessment required__ 

                Upon identification of a named storm under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall develop a post-storm assessment for such named storm using the Named Storm Event Model and covered data collected for such named storm pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c)(1).

            (C) __Submittal of post-storm assessment__ 

                Not later than 90 days after an identification of a named storm is made under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall submit to the Secretary of Homeland Security the post-storm assessment developed for such storm under subparagraph (B).

        (3) __Accuracy__ 

            The Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that each post-storm assessment developed under paragraph (2) has a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent.

        (4) __Certification__ 

        For each post-storm assessment carried out under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall—

            (A) certify the degree of accuracy for such assessment, including specific reference to any segments or geographic areas for which the assessment is less than 90 percent accurate; and

            (B) report such certification to the Secretary of Homeland Security for the purposes of use with indeterminate loss claims under [section 4057 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s4057].

        (5) __Finality of determinations__

        (6) __Availability__ 

            The Administrator shall make available to the public the Named Storm Event Model and any post-storm assessment developed under this subsection.

    (c) __Establishment of a protocol for post-storm assessment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 540 days after July 6, 2012, the Administrator shall establish a protocol, based on the plan submitted under subsection (d)(3), to collect and assemble all covered data required by the Administrator to produce post-storm assessments required by subsection (b), including assembling data collected by participants and stored in the database established under subsection (f) and from such other sources as the Administrator considers appropriate.

        (2) __Acquisition of sensors and structures__ 

            If the Administrator is unable to use a public or private asset to obtain covered data as part of the protocol established under paragraph (1), the Administrator may acquire such sensors and structures for the placement of sensors as may be necessary to obtain such data.

        (3) __Use of Federal assets__ 

            If the protocol requires placement of a sensor to develop assessments pursuant to subsection (b), the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, use Federal assets for the placement of such sensors.

        (4) __Use of acquired structures__ 

            (A) __In general__
