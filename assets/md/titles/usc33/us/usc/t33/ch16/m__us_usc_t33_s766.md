 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    The officers or employees to be retired refer to the officers and employees of the Lighthouse Service. The Lighthouse Service was under the Secretary of Commerce prior to the transfer and consolidation of the Bureau of Lighthouses, of which the Lighthouse Service was a part, with the Coast Guard which was under the Secretary of the Treasury by Reorg. Plan No. II, § 2(a), set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Subsequently, the functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by [section 6(b)(1) of Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670/s6/b/1]. See [section 108 of Title 49][/us/usc/t49/s108], Transportation.

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
