 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    “Commandant of the Coast Guard” substituted in text for “member of the Light-House Board” on authority of sections 6 and 13 of act June 17, 1910, which abolished board and transferred its powers and duties to Commissioner of Lighthouses who was head of Bureau of Lighthouses. Said sections 6 and 13 were repealed by section 20 of act Aug. 4, 1949, section 1 of which reestablished the Coast Guard by enacting Title 14, Coast Guard. Section 2(a) of Reorg. Plan No. II of 1939, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, consolidated Bureau of Lighthouses with Coast Guard, Chief of which is Commandant of Coast Guard.

    The words “superintendent of lighthouses” substituted for “inspector” on authority of act June 20, 1918, which transferred such officers to the positions of superintendent of lighthouses within the Bureau of Lighthouses.

    The light-house service was a service under control of Commissioner of Lighthouses within Bureau of Lighthouses.

Plan No. 26 of 1950, §§ 1, 2 eff. July 31, 1950, 15 F.R. 4935, [64 Stat. 1280][/us/stat/64/1280], 1281, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Functions of Coast Guard, and Commandant of Coast Guard, excepted from transfer when Coast Guard is operating as part of Navy under sections 1 and 3 of Title 14, Coast Guard.
