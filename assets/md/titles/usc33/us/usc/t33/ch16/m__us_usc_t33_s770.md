## § 770. Regulations for expenditure of moneys accruing from commutation of rations and provisions

    Money accruing from commutation of rations and provisions for working parties in the field, officers and crews of light vessels and tenders, and officials and other authorized persons on board of such tenders or vessels, after payment on proper vouchers to the officer in charge of the mess of such vessel or party, as provided by law, may be expended and accounted for pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1321 and 1322(a) of title 31.

([May 13, 1938, ch. 215][/us/act/1938-05-13/ch215], § 3, [52 Stat. 353][/us/stat/52/353]; 1939 Reorg. Plan No. II, § 2(a), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, [53 Stat. 1432][/us/stat/53/1432]; [Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670], § 6(b)(1), Oct. 15, 1966, [80 Stat. 938][/us/stat/80/938].)

 __Codification__ 

    “Sections 1321 and 1322(a) of title 31” substituted in text for “the Act of June 26, 1934 ([48 Stat. 1233][/us/stat/48/1233]) \[[31 U.S.C. 725s][/us/usc/t31/s725s]\]” on authority of [Pub.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    The money accruing from commutation of rations and provisions refer to such moneys of persons in the Lighthouse Service.

Plan No. II, § 2(a), set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Subsequently, the functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by [section 6(b)(1) of Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670/s6/b/1]. See [section 108 of Title 49][/us/usc/t49/s108], Transportation.

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
