## CHAPTER 4—NAVIGATION RULES FOR GREAT LAKES AND THEIR CONNECTING AND TRIBUTARY WATERS

    Prior rules for preventing collision prescribed by R.S. § 4233 to be followed by vessels of the Navy and mercantile marine of the United States, applicable originally to all waters, were superseded as to navigation on the high seas and waters connected therewith by the International Rules ([act Aug. 19, 1890, ch. 802][/us/act/1890-08-19/ch802] \[sec. 61 et seq. of this title\]) were superseded as to navigation on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal, by [act Feb. 8, 1895, ch. 64][/us/act/1895-02-08/ch64] (section 241 et seq. of this title); were adopted as special rules for the navigation of harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal by [act of Feb. 19, 1895, ch. 102][/us/act/1895-02-19/ch102] (see section 301 et seq. of this title); and were superseded as to navigation of all harbors, rivers, and inland waters of the United States, except the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as Montreal and the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and their tributaries by [act June 7, 1897, ch. 4, § 1][/us/act/1897-06-07/ch4/s1], [30 Stat. 96][/us/stat/30/96] (section 151 et seq. of this title), leaving them applicable solely to the Red River of the North and rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico.
