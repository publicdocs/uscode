    (a) __In general__ 

        If 2 or more flood control projects are located within the same geographic area, the Secretary shall, at the request of the non-Federal interests for the affected projects, consider those projects as a single program for budgetary or project management purposes, if the Secretary determines that doing so would not be incompatible with the authorized project purposes.

            If any work on a project to which subsection (a) applies is required solely because of impacts to that project from a navigation project, the cost of carrying out that work shall be shared in accordance with the cost-sharing requirements for the navigation project.

        (2) __Use of amounts__ 

            Work described in paragraph (1) may be carried out using amounts made available under subsection (a).
