## § 701h. Contributions by States, political subdivisions, and other non-Federal interests

    The Secretary of the Army is authorized to receive from States and political subdivisions thereof and other non-Federal interests, such funds as may be contributed by them for work, which includes planning and design, to be expended in connection with funds appropriated by the United States for any authorized water resources development study or project, including a project for navigation on the inland waterways, whenever such work and expenditure may be considered by the Secretary of the Army, on recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, as advantageous in the public interest, and the plans for any reservoir project may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Army, on recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, be modified to provide additional storage capacity for domestic water supply or other conservation storage, on condition that the cost of such increased storage capacity is contributed by local agencies and that the local agencies agree to utilize such additional storage capacity in a manner consistent with Federal uses and purposes: Provided, That the Secretary is authorized to receive and expend funds from a State or a political subdivision thereof, and other non-Federal interests or private entities, to operate a hurricane barrier project to support recreational activities at or in the vicinity of the project, at no cost to the Federal Government, if the Secretary determines that operation for such purpose is not inconsistent with the operation and maintenance of the project for the authorized purposes of the project: Provided further, That when contributions made by States and political subdivisions thereof and other non-Federal interests, are in excess of the actual cost of the work contemplated and properly chargeable to such contributions, such excess contributions may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Army, be returned to the proper representatives of the contributing interests: Provided further, That the term “States” means the several States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States, and Federally recognized Indian tribes: Provided further, That the term “non-Federal interest” has the meaning given that term in [section 1962d–5b of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1962d–5b].

([June 22, 1936, ch. 688, § 5][/us/act/1936-06-22/ch688/s5] (part), [49 Stat. 1572][/us/stat/49/1572]; [July 19, 1937, ch. 511, § 1][/us/act/1937-07-19/ch511/s1], [50 Stat. 518][/us/stat/50/518]; [July 26, 1947, ch. 343][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343], title II, § 205(a), [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]; [Pub. L. 106–53, title II, § 203][/us/pl/106/53/s203], Aug. 17, 1999, [113 Stat. 285][/us/stat/113/285]; [Pub. L. 112–74, div. B, title I, § 111(a)][/us/pl/112/74/s111/a], Dec. 23, 2011, [125 Stat. 858][/us/stat/125/858]; [Pub. L. 113–121, title I, § 1015(a)][/us/pl/113/121/s1015/a], June 10, 2014, [128 Stat. 1222][/us/stat/128/1222].)

 __Codification__ 

    When originally enacted, section 5 of act June 22, 1936, which consisted of a paragraph (including a proviso) authorizing works of improvement followed by numerous headings and paragraphs describing those authorized works, was not classified to the Code. Act July 19, 1937, amended section 5 of act June 22, 1936, by inserting two additional provisos at the end of the first paragraph. The provisos inserted by the 1937 Act, as amended, form the sole basis for the text appearing in this section, with minor editorial changes to the introductory language of the provisos. Subsequent amendments to section 5 of act June 22, 1936, have generally been directed to the text of section 5 as it has appeared in the Code and have not taken into account the portion of that section that has never been set out. Those amendments have been executed as directed, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, and amendment notes below reflect such execution without further comment.

 __Amendments__ 

    2014—[Pub. L. 113–121, § 1015(a)(4)][/us/pl/113/121/s1015/a/4], substituted “: Provided further, That the term ‘non-Federal interest’ has the meaning given that term in [section 1962d–5b of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1962d–5b].” for period at end.

    [Pub. L. 113–121, § 1015(a)(3)][/us/pl/113/121/s1015/a/3], substituted “Provided, That the Secretary is authorized to receive and expend funds from a State or a political subdivision thereof, and other non-Federal interests or private entities, to operate a hurricane barrier project to support recreational activities at or in the vicinity of the project, at no cost to the Federal Government, if the Secretary determines that operation for such purpose is not inconsistent with the operation and maintenance of the project for the authorized purposes of the project: Provided further, That when” for “Provided, That when”.

    [Pub. L. 113–121, § 1015(a)(1)][/us/pl/113/121/s1015/a/1], (2), inserted “and other non-Federal interests” after “States and political subdivisions thereof” in two places and inserted “, including a project for navigation on the inland waterways,” after “study or project”.

    2011—[Pub. L. 112–74][/us/pl/112/74] substituted “water resources development study or project” for “flood control or environmental restoration work” and inserted “for work, which includes planning and design,” before “to be expended” and “: Provided further, That the term ‘States’ means the several States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States, and Federally recognized Indian tribes” before period at end.

    1999—[Pub. L. 106–53][/us/pl/106/53] inserted “or environmental restoration” after “flood control”.

    1937—Act July 19, 1937, inserted text of section.

 __Change of Name__ 

    Department of War designated Department of the Army and title of Secretary of War changed to Secretary of the Army by section 205(a) of [act July 26, 1947, ch. 343][/us/act/1947-07-26/ch343], title II, [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]. Section 205(a) of act July 26, 1947, was repealed by section 53 of [act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041], [70A Stat. 641][/us/stat/70A/641]. Section 1 of act Aug. 10, 1956, enacted “Title 10, Armed Forces” which in sections 3010 to 3013 continued Department of the Army under administrative supervision of Secretary of the Army.

 __Notification for Contributed Funds__ 

[Pub. L. 113–121, title I, § 1015(b)][/us/pl/113/121/s1015/b], June 10, 2014, [128 Stat. 1223][/us/stat/128/1223], provided that: 

> “Prior to accepting funds contributed under [section 5 of the Act of June 22, 1936][/us/act/1936-06-22/s5] ([33 U.S.C. 701h][/us/usc/t33/s701h]), the Secretary \[of the Army\] shall provide written notice of the funds to the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.”
