## § 701b–13. Construction of flood control projects by non-Federal interests

    (a) __Authority__ 

        Non-Federal interests are authorized to undertake flood control projects in the United States, subject to obtaining any permits required pursuant to Federal and State laws in advance of actual construction.

    (b) __Studies and design activities__ 

        (1) __By non-Federal interests__ 

            A non-Federal interest may prepare, for review and approval by the Secretary, the necessary studies and design documents for any construction to be undertaken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) __By Secretary__ 

            Upon request of an appropriate non-Federal interest, the Secretary may undertake all necessary studies and design activities for any construction to be undertaken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and provide technical assistance in obtaining all necessary permits for such construction if the non-Federal interest contracts with the Secretary to provide to the United States funds for the studies and design activities during the period in which the studies and design activities will be conducted.

    (c) __Completion of studies and design activities__ 

        In the case of any study or design documents for a flood control project that were initiated before October 12, 1996, the Secretary may complete and transmit to the appropriate non-Federal interests the study or design documents or, upon the request of such non-Federal interests, terminate the study or design activities and transmit the partially completed study or design documents to such non-Federal interests for completion. Studies and design documents subject to this subsection shall be completed without regard to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

    (d) __Authority to carry out improvement__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Studies and design activities under subsection (b)__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A non-Federal interest may carry out construction for which studies and design documents are prepared under subsection (b) of this section only if the Secretary approves the project for construction.

                (ii) __Criteria for approval__ 

                    The Secretary shall approve a project for construction if the Secretary determines that the project is technically sound, economically justified, and environmentally acceptable and meets the requirements for obtaining the appropriate permits required under the authority of the Secretary.

                (iii) __No unreasonable withholding of approval__ 

                    The Secretary shall not unreasonably withhold approval of a project for construction.

                (iv) __No effect on regulatory authority__ 

                    Nothing in this subparagraph affects any regulatory authority of the Secretary.

            (B) __Studies and design activities under subsection (c)__ 

                Any non-Federal interest that has received from the Secretary under subsection (c) of this section a favorable recommendation to carry out a flood control project, or separable element of a flood control project, based on the results of completed studies and design documents for the project or element may carry out the project or element if a final environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.) has been filed for the project or element.

        (2) __Permits__ 

            Any plan of improvement proposed to be implemented in accordance with this subsection (other than paragraph (1)(A)) shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for obtaining the appropriate permits required under the Secretary’s authority. Such permits shall be granted subject to the non-Federal interest’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of such permits if the Secretary determines that the applicable regulatory criteria and procedures have been satisfied.

        (3) __Monitoring__ 

            The Secretary shall monitor any project for which a permit is granted under this subsection in order to ensure that such project is constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the terms and conditions of such permit.

    (e) __Reimbursement__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        Subject to appropriations Acts, the Secretary may reimburse any non-Federal interest an amount equal to the estimate of the Federal share, without interest, of the cost of any authorized flood control project, or separable element of a flood control project, constructed pursuant to this section and provide credit for the non-Federal share of the project—

            (A) if, after authorization and before initiation of construction of the project or separable element, the Secretary approves the plans for construction of such project by the non-Federal interest;

            (B) if the Secretary finds, after a review of studies and design documents prepared pursuant to this section, that construction of the project or separable element is economically justified and environmentally acceptable; and

            (C) if the construction work is substantially in accordance with plans prepared under subsection (b) of this section.

        (2) __Special rules__ 

            (A) __Reimbursement or credit__ 

                For work (including work associated with studies, planning, design, and construction) carried out by a non-Federal interest with respect to a project described in subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, reimburse, without interest, the non-Federal interest an amount equal to the estimated Federal share of the cost of such work, or provide credit (depending on the request of the non-Federal interest) for the non-Federal share of such work, if such work is later recommended by the Chief of Engineers and approved by the Secretary.

            (B) __Credit__ 

                If the non-Federal interest for a project described in subsection (f) of this section carries out work before completion of a reconnaissance study by the Secretary and if such work is determined by the Secretary to be compatible with the project later recommended by the Secretary, the Secretary shall credit the non-Federal interest for its share of the cost of the project for such work.

        (3) __Matters to be considered in reviewing plans__ 

            In reviewing plans under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider budgetary and programmatic priorities and other factors that the Secretary considers appropriate.

        (4) __Monitoring__ 

            The Secretary shall regularly monitor and audit any project for flood control approved for construction under this section by a non-Federal interest to ensure that such construction is in compliance with the plans approved by the Secretary and that the costs are reasonable.

        (5) __Limitation on reimbursements__ 

            The Secretary may not make any reimbursement under this section until the Secretary determines that the work for which reimbursement is requested has been performed in accordance with applicable permits and approved plans.

        (6) __Schedule and manner of reimbursement__ 

            (A) __Budgeting__ 

                The Secretary shall budget and request appropriations for reimbursements under this section on a schedule that is consistent with a Federal construction schedule.

            (B) __Commencement of reimbursements__ 

                Reimbursements under this section may commence on approval of a project by the Secretary.

            (C) __Credit__ 

                At the request of a non-Federal interest, the Secretary may reimburse the non-Federal interest by providing credit toward future non-Federal costs of the project.

            (D) __Scheduling__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph affects the discretion of the President to schedule new construction starts.
