## § 2314a. Technical assistance program

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance, on a nonexclusive basis, to any United States firm which is competing for, or has been awarded, a contract for the planning, design, or construction of a project outside the United States, if the United States firm provides, in advance of fiscal obligation by the United States, funds to cover all costs of such assistance.

Prior to the Secretary providing such assistance, a United States firm must—

        (2) agree to hold and save the United States free from damages due to the planning, design, construction, operation, or maintenance of the project.

    (b) __Federal employees’ inventions__ 

    As to an invention made or conceived by a Federal employee while providing assistance pursuant to this section, if the Secretary decides not to retain all rights in such invention, the Secretary may—

        (1) grant or agree to grant in advance, to a United States firm, a patent license or assignment, or an option thereto, retaining a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States and such other rights as the Secretary deems appropriate; or

        (2) waive, subject to reservation by the United States of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States, in advance, in whole, or in part, any right which the United States may have to such invention.

    (c) __Protection of confidential information__ 

        Information of a confidential nature, such as proprietary or classified information, provided to a United States firm pursuant to this section shall be protected. Such information may be released by a United States firm only after written approval by the Secretary.
