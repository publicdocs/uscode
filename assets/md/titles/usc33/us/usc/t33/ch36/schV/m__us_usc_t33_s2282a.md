    (d) __Calculation of benefits and costs for flood damage reduction projects__ 

    A feasibility study for a project for flood damage reduction shall include, as part of the calculation of benefits and costs—

        (1) a calculation of the residual risk of flooding following completion of the proposed project;

        (2) a calculation of the residual risk of loss of human life and residual risk to human safety following completion of the proposed project;

        (3) a calculation of any upstream or downstream impacts of the proposed project; and

        (4) calculations to ensure that the benefits and costs associated with structural and nonstructural alternatives are evaluated in an equitable manner.

    (e) __Centers of specialized planning expertise__

            (A) provide technical and managerial assistance to district commanders of the Corps of Engineers for project planning, development, and implementation;

            (B) provide agency peer reviews of new major scientific, engineering, or economic methods, models, or analyses that will be used to support decisions of the Secretary with respect to feasibility studies for water resources projects;

            (C) provide support for independent peer review panels under [section 2343 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2343]; and

            (D) carry out such other duties as are prescribed by the Secretary.

            (C) __Reports of Chief of Engineers__ 

                The reports of the Chief of Engineers shall identify any recommendation that is not the best technical solution to water resource needs and problems and the reason for the deviation.

        (2) __Report completion__ 

        The completion of a report of the Chief of Engineers for a water resources project—

            (A) shall not be delayed while consideration is being given to potential changes in policy or priority for project consideration; and
