## § 2236. Port or harbor dues

    (a) __Consent of Congress__ 

    Subject to the following conditions, a non-Federal interest may levy port or harbor dues (in the form of tonnage duties or fees) on a vessel engaged in trade entering or departing from a harbor and on cargo loaded on or unloaded from that vessel under clauses 2 and 3 of section 10, and under clause 3 of section 8, of Article 1 of the Constitution:

        (1) __Purposes__ 

        Port or harbor dues may be levied only in conjunction with a harbor navigation project whose construction is complete (including a usable increment of the project) and for the following purposes and in amounts not to exceed those necessary to carry out those purposes:

            (A)

                (i) to finance the non-Federal share of construction and operation and maintenance costs of a navigation project for a harbor under the requirements of [section 2211 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2211]; or

                (ii) to finance the cost of construction and operation and maintenance of a navigation project for a harbor under section 2232 or 2233 of this title; and

            (B) provide emergency response services in the harbor, including contingency planning, necessary personnel training, and the procurement of equipment and facilities.

        (2) __Limitation on port or harbor dues for emer­gency service__ 

            Port or harbor dues may not be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection after the dues cease to be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.

        (3) __General limitations__ 

            (A)

             Port or harbor dues may not be levied under this section in conjunction with a deepening feature of a navigation improvement project on any vessel if that vessel, based on its design draft, could have utilized the project at mean low water before construction. In the case of project features which solely—

                (i) widen channels or harbors,

                (ii) create or enlarge bend easings, turning basins or anchorage areas, or provide protected areas, or

                (iii) remove obstructions to navigation,

                only vessels at least comparable in size to those used to justify these features may be charged under this section.

            (B) In developing port or harbor dues that may be charged under this section on vessels for project features constructed under this subchapter, the non-Federal interest may consider such criteria as: elapsed time of passage, safety of passage, vessel economy of scale, under keel clearance, vessel draft, vessel squat, vessel speed, sinkage, and trim.

            (C)

             Port or harbor dues authorized by this section shall not be imposed on—

                (i) vessels owned and operated by the United States Government, a foreign country, a State, or a political subdivision of a country or State, unless engaged in commercial services;

                (ii) towing vessels, vessels engaged in dredging activities, or vessels engaged in intraport movements; or

                (iii) vessels with design drafts of 20 feet or less when utilizing general cargo and deep-draft navigation projects.

        (4) __Formulation of port or harbor dues__ 

        Port or harbor dues may be levied only on a vessel entering or departing from a harbor and its cargo on a fair and equitable basis. In formulating port and harbor dues, the non-Federal interest shall consider—

            (A) the direct and indirect cost of construction, operations, and maintenance, and providing the facilities and services under paragraph (1) of this subsection;

            (B) the value of those facilities and services to the vessel and cargo;

            (C) the public policy or interest served; and

            (D) any other pertinent factors.

        (5) __Notice and hearing__ 

            (A)

             Before the initial levy of or subsequent modification to port or harbor dues under this section, a non-Federal interest shall transmit to the Secretary—

                (i) the text of the proposed law, regulation, or ordinance that would establish the port or harbor dues, including provisions for their administration, collection, and enforcement;

                (ii) the name, address, and telephone number of an official to whom comments on and requests for further information on the proposal are to be directed;

                (iii) the date by which comments on the proposal are due and a date for a public hearing on the proposal at which any interested party may present a statement; however, the non-Federal interest may not set a hearing date earlier than 45 days after the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or set a deadline for receipt of comments earlier than 60 days after the date of publication; and

                (iv) a written statement signed by an appropriate official that the non-Federal interest agrees to be governed by the provisions of this section.

            (B) On receiving from a non-Federal interest the information required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall transmit the material required by clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the Federal Register for publication.

            (C) Port or harbor dues may be imposed by a non-Federal interest only after meeting the conditions of this paragraph.

        (6) __Requirements on non-Federal interest__ 

        A non-Federal interest shall—

            (A) file a schedule of any port or harbor dues levied under this subsection with the Secretary and the Federal Maritime Commission, which the Commission shall make available for public inspection;

            (B) provide to the Comptroller General of the United States on request of the Comptroller General any records or other evidence that the Comptroller General considers to be necessary and appropriate to enable the Comptroller General to carry out the audit required under subsection (b)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this section;

            (C) designate an officer or authorized representative, including the Secretary of the Treasury acting on a cost-reimbursable basis, to receive tonnage certificates and cargo manifests from vessels which may be subject to the levy of port or harbor dues, export declarations from shippers, consignors, and terminal operators, and such other documents as the non-Federal interest may by law, regulation, or ordinance require for the imposition, computation, and collection of port or harbor dues; and

            (D) consent expressly to the exclusive exercise of Federal jurisdiction under subsection (c) 1 of this section.

    (b) __Jurisdiction__ 

        (1) The district court of the United States for the district in which is located a non-Federal interest that levies port or harbor dues under this section has original and exclusive jurisdiction over any matter arising out of or concerning, the imposition, computation, collection, and enforcement of port or harbor dues by a non-Federal interest under this section.

        (2) Any person who suffers legal wrong or is adversely affected or aggrieved by the imposition by a non-Federal interest of a proposed scheme or schedule of port or harbor dues under this section may, not later than 180 days after the date of hearing under subsection (a)(5)(A)(iii) of this section, commence an action to seek judicial review of that proposed scheme or schedule in the appropriate district court under paragraph (1).

        (3)

         On petition of the Attorney General or any other party, that district court may—

            (A) grant appropriate injunctive relief to restrain an action by that non-Federal interest violating the conditions of consent in subsection (a) of this section;

            (B) order the refund of any port or harbor dues not lawfully collected; and

        (2) assess a penalty or initiate a forfeiture of the cargo in the same manner and under the same procedures as are applicable for failure to pay customs duties under the Tariff Act of 1930 ([19 U.S.C. 1202][/us/usc/t19/s1202] et seq.) if the shipper, consignor, consignee, or terminal operator having title to or custody of cargo subject to port or harbor dues under this section fails to comply with the provisions of this section including any non-Federal law, regulation, or ordinance issued hereunder.

    (e) __Maritime Lien__
