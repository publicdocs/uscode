## § 2282. Feasibility reports

    (a) __Preparation of reports__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of any water resources project-related study authorized to be undertaken by the Secretary that results in recommendations concerning a project or the operation of a project and that requires specific authorization by Congress in law or otherwise, the Secretary shall prepare a feasibility report, subject to [section 2215 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2215].

        (2) __Contents of feasibility reports__ 

            A feasibility report shall describe, with reasonable certainty, the economic, environmental, and social benefits and detriments of the recommended plan and alternative plans considered by the Secretary and the engineering features (including hydrologic and geologic information), the public acceptability, and the purposes, scope, and scale of the recommended plan. A feasibility report shall also include the views of other Federal agencies and non-Federal agencies with regard to the recommended plan, a description of a nonstructural alternative to the recommended plan when such plan does not have significant nonstructural features, and a description of the Federal and non-Federal participation in such plan, and shall demonstrate that States, other non-Federal interests, and Federal agencies have been consulted in the development of the recommended plan. A feasibility report shall include a preliminary analysis of the Federal interest and the costs, benefits, and environmental impacts of the project.

        (3) __Applicability__ 

        This subsection shall not apply to—

            (A) any study with respect to which a report has been submitted to Congress before November 17, 1986;

            (B) any study for a project, which project is authorized for construction by this Act and is not subject to section 903(b);  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

            (C) any study for a project which does not require specific authorization by Congress in law or otherwise; and

            (D) general studies not intended to lead to recommendation of a specific water resources project.

        (4) __Feasibility report defined__ 

            In this subsection, the term “feasibility report” means each feasibility report, and any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan, prepared by the Corps of Engineers for a water resources project. The term includes a project implementation report prepared under title VI of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 ([114 Stat. 2680–2694][/us/stat/114/2680-2694]), a general reevaluation report, and a limited reevaluation report.

    (b) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 113–121, title I, § 1002(a)(1)__  __][/us/pl/113/121/s1002/a/1]__  __,__  __June 10, 2014__  __,__  __[__  __128 Stat. 1198__  __][/us/stat/128/1198]__

        In the case of any water resources project-related study authorized to be undertaken by the Secretary without specific authorization by Congress in law or otherwise, the Secretary shall prepare a detailed project report.

    (d) __Indian tribes__ 

        For purposes of studies undertaken pursuant to this section, the Secretary is authorized to consider benefits which may accrue to Indian tribes as a result of a project resulting from such a study.

    (e) __Standard and uniform procedures and practices__ 

        The Secretary shall undertake such measures as are necessary to ensure that standard and uniform procedures and practices are followed by each district office (and each division office for any area in which there is no district office) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the preparation of feasibility reports on water resources projects.

    (f) __Enhanced public participation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish procedures to enhance public participation in the development of each feasibility study under subsection (a) of this section, including, if appropriate, establishment of a stakeholder advisory group to assist the Secretary with the development of the study.

        (2) __Membership__ 

            If the Secretary provides for the establishment of a stakeholder advisory group under this subsection, the membership of the advisory group shall include balanced representation of social, economic, and environmental interest groups, and such members shall serve on a voluntary, uncompensated basis.

        (3) __Limitation__ 

            Procedures established under this subsection shall not delay development of any feasibility study under subsection (a) of this section.

    (g) __Detailed project schedule__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 180 days after June 10, 2014, the Secretary shall determine a set of milestones needed for the completion of a feasibility study under this subsection, including all major actions, report submissions and responses, reviews, and comment periods.

        (2) __Detailed project schedule milestones__ 

            Each District Engineer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, establish a detailed project schedule, based on full funding capability, that lists all deadlines for milestones relating to feasibility studies in the District developed by the Secretary under paragraph (1).

        Each District Engineer shall submit by certified mail the detailed project schedule under paragraph (2) to each relevant non-Federal interest—

            (A) for projects that have received funding from the General Investigations Account of the Corps of Engineers in the period beginning on October 1, 2009, and ending on June 10, 2014, not later than 180 days after the establishment of milestones under paragraph (1); and

            (B) for projects for which a feasibility cost-sharing agreement is executed after the establishment of milestones under paragraph (1), not later than 90 days after the date on which the agreement is executed.

        (4) __Congressional and public notification__ 

        Beginning in the first full fiscal year after June 10, 2014, the Secretary shall—

            (A) submit an annual report that lists all detailed project schedules under paragraph (2) and an explanation of any missed deadlines to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; and

            (B) make publicly available, including on the Internet, a copy of the annual report described in subparagraph (A) not later than 14 days after date  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be preceded by “the”. </sup></sup>  on which a report is submitted to Congress.

        (5) __Failure to act__ 

        If a District Engineer fails to meet any of the deadlines in the project schedule under paragraph (2), the District Engineer shall—

            (A)

             not later than 30 days after each missed deadline, submit to the non-Federal interest a report detailing—

                (i) why the District Engineer failed to meet the deadline; and

                (ii) a revised project schedule reflecting amended deadlines for the feasibility study; and

            (B) not later than 30 days after each missed deadline, make publicly available, including on the Internet, a copy of the amended project schedule described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
