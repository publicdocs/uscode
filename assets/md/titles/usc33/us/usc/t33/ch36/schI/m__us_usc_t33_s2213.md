## § 2213. Flood control and other purposes

    (a) __Flood control__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        The non-Federal interests for a project with costs assigned to flood control (other than a nonstructural project) shall—

            (A) pay 5 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control during construction of the project;

            (B) provide all lands, easements, rights-of-way, and dredged material disposal areas required only for flood control and perform all related necessary relocations; and

            (C) provide that portion of the joint costs of lands, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations which is assigned to flood control.

        (2) __35 percent minimum contribution__ 

            If the value of the contributions required under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than 35 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control, the non-Federal interest shall pay during construction of the project such additional amounts as are necessary so that the total contribution of the non-Federal interests under this subsection is equal to 35 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control.

        (3) __50 percent maximum__ 

            The non-Federal share under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control. The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.

        (4) __Deferred payment of amount exceeding 30 percent__ 

            If the total amount of the contribution required under paragraph (1) of this subsection exceeds 30 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control, the non-Federal interests may pay the amount of the excess to the Secretary over a 15-year period (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Secretary and the non-Federal interests) beginning on the date construction of the project or separable element is completed, at an interest rate determined pursuant to [section 2216 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2216]. The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.

    (b) __Nonstructural flood control projects__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The non-Federal share of the cost of nonstructural flood control measures shall be 35 percent of the cost of such measures. The non-Federal interests for any such measures shall be required to provide all lands, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations necessary for the project, but shall not be required to contribute any amount in cash during construction of the project.

        (2) __Non-Federal contribution in excess of 35 percent__ 

            At any time during construction of a project, if the Secretary determines that the costs of land, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations for the project, in combination with other costs contributed by the non-Federal interests, will exceed 35 percent, any additional costs for the project (not to exceed 65 percent of the total costs of the project) shall be a Federal responsibility and shall be contributed during construction as part of the Federal share.

    (c) __Other purposes__ 

    The non-Federal share of the cost assigned to other project purposes shall be as follows:

        (1) hydroelectric power: 100 percent, except that the marketing of such power and the recovery of costs of constructing, operating, maintaining, and rehabilitating such projects shall be in accordance with existing law: Provided, That after November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall not submit to Congress any proposal for the authorization of any water resources project that has a hydroelectric power component unless such proposal contains the comments of the appropriate Power Marketing Administrator designated pursuant to [section 7152 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s7152] concerning the appropriate Power Marketing Administration’s ability to market the hydroelectric power expected to be generated and not required in the operation of the project under the applicable Federal power marketing law, so that, 100 percent of operation, maintenance and replacement costs, 100 percent of the capital investment allocated to the purpose of hydroelectric power (with interest at rates established pursuant to or prescribed by applicable law), and any other costs assigned in accordance with law for return from power revenues can be returned within the period set for the return of such costs by or pursuant to such applicable Federal power marketing law;

        (2) municipal and industrial water supply: 100 percent;

        (3) agricultural water supply: 35 percent;

        (4) recreation, including recreational navigation: 50 percent of separable costs and, in the case of any harbor or inland harbor or channel project, 50 percent of joint and separable costs allocated to recreational navigation;

        (5) hurricane and storm damage reduction: 35 percent;

        (6) aquatic plant control: 50 percent of control operations; and

        (7) environmental protection and restoration: 35 percent; except that nothing in this paragraph shall affect or limit the applicability of [section 2283 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2283].

    (d) __Certain other costs assigned to project purposes__ 

        (1) __Construction__ 

            Costs of constructing projects or measures for beach erosion control and water quality enhancement shall be assigned to appropriate project purposes listed in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section and shall be shared in the same percentage as the purposes to which the costs are assigned, except that all costs assigned to benefits to privately owned shores (where use of such shores is limited to private interests) or to prevention of losses of private lands shall be borne by non-Federal interests and all costs assigned to the protection of federally owned shores shall be borne by the United States.

        (2) __Periodic nourishment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of a project authorized for construction after December 31, 1999, except for a project for which a District Engineer’s Report is completed by that date, the non-Federal cost of the periodic nourishment of the project, or any measure for shore protection or beach erosion control for the project, that is carried out—
