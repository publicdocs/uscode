## § 2348. Project streamlining

    (a) __Policy__ 

        The benefits of water resources projects are important to the Nation’s economy and environment, and recommendations to Congress regarding such projects should not be delayed due to uncoordinated or inefficient reviews or the failure to timely resolve disputes during the development of water resources projects.

    (b) __Scope__ 

        This section shall apply to each study initiated after November 8, 2007, to develop a feasibility report under [section 2282 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2282], or a reevaluation report, for a water resources project if the Secretary determines that such study requires an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.).

    (c) __Water resources project review process__ 

        The Secretary shall develop and implement a coordinated review process for the development of water resources projects.

    (d) __Coordinated reviews__ 

        The coordinated review process under this section may provide that all reviews, analyses, opinions, permits, licenses, and approvals that must be issued or made by a Federal, State, or local government agency or Indian tribe for the development of a water resources project described in subsection (b) will be conducted, to the maximum extent practicable, concurrently and completed within a time period established by the Secretary in cooperation with the agencies identified under subsection (e) with respect to the project.

    (e) __Identification of jurisdictional agencies__ 

    With respect to the development of each water resources project, the Secretary shall identify, as soon as practicable, all Federal, State, and local government agencies and Indian tribes that may—

        (1) have jurisdiction over the project;

        (2) be required by law to conduct or issue a review, analysis, or opinion for the project; or

        (3) be required to make a determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval for the project.

    (f) __State authority__ 

    If the coordinated review process is being implemented under this section by the Secretary with respect to the development of a water resources project described in subsection (b) within the boundaries of a State, the State, consistent with State law, may choose to participate in the process and to make subject to the process all State agencies that—

        (1) have jurisdiction over the project;

        (2) are required to conduct or issue a review, analysis, or opinion for the project; or

        (3) are required to make a determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval for the project.

    (g) __Memorandum of understanding__ 

        The coordinated review process developed under this section may be incorporated into a memorandum of understanding for a water resources project between the Secretary, the heads of Federal, State, and local government agencies, Indian tribes identified under subsection (e), and the non-Federal interest for the project.

    (h) __Effect of failure to meet deadline__ 

        (1) __Notification__ 

            If the Secretary determines that a Federal, State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest that is participating in the coordinated review process under this section with respect to the development of a water resources project has not met a deadline established under subsection (d) for the project, the Secretary shall notify, within 30 days of the date of such determination, the agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest about the failure to meet the deadline.

        (2) __Agency report__ 

            Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), the Federal, State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest involved may submit a report to the Secretary, explaining why the agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest did not meet the deadline and what actions it intends to take to complete or issue the required review, analysis, or opinion or determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval.

        (3) __Report to Congress__ 

            Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of a report under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall compile and submit a report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, and the Council on Environmental Quality, describing any deadlines identified in paragraph (1), and any information provided to the Secretary by the Federal, State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest involved under paragraph (2).

    (i) __Limitations__ 

    Nothing in this section shall preempt or interfere with—

        (1) any statutory requirement for seeking public comment;

        (2) any power, jurisdiction, or authority that a Federal, State, or local government agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest has with respect to carrying out a water resources project; or

        (3) any obligation to comply with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \[[42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.\] and the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality to carry out such Act.
