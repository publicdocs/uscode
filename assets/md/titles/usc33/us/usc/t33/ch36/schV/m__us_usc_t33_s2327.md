## § 2327. Definition of rehabilitation for inland waterway projects

    For purposes of laws relating to navigation on inland and intracoastal waterways of the United States, the term “rehabilitation” means—

    (1)

     major project feature restoration—

        (A) which consists of structural work on an inland navigation facility operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers;

        (B) which will significantly extend the physical life of the feature;

        (C) which is economically justified by a benefit-cost analysis;

        (D) which will take at least 2 years to complete; and

        (E)

            (i) which is initially funded before October 1, 1994, and will require at least $5,000,000 in capital outlays; or

            (ii) which is initially funded on or after such date and will require at least $20,000,000 in capital outlays; and

    (2)

     structural modification of a major project component (not exhibiting reliability problems)—

        (A) which will enhance the operational efficiency of such component or any other major component of the project by increasing benefits beyond the original project design; and

        (B) which will require at least $1,000,000 in capital outlays.

    Such term does not include routine or deferred maintenance. The dollar amounts referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be adjusted annually according to the economic assumption published each year as guidance in the Annual Program and Budget Request for Civil Works Activities of the Corps of Engineers.
