    (c) __Termination of authorization__ 

        A feasibility study for which the Secretary has issued a determination under subsection (b) is not authorized after the last day of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the determination if the Secretary has not completed the study on or before such last day.

    (d) __Exception__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (c), the Secretary may extend the timeline of a study by a period not to exceed 3 years, if the Secretary determines that the feasibility study is too complex to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (c).

        (2) __Factors__ 

        In making a determination that a study is too complex to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (c), the Secretary shall consider—

            (A) the type, size, location, scope, and overall cost of the project;

            (B) whether the project will use any innovative design or construction techniques;

            (C) whether the project will require significant action by other Federal, State, or local agencies;

            (D) whether there is significant public dispute as to the nature or effects of the project; and

            (E) whether there is significant public dispute as to the economic or environmental costs or benefits of the project.

        (3) __Notification__ 

            Each time the Secretary makes a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives as to the results of that determination, including an identification of the specific 1 or more factors used in making the determination that the project is complex.

        (4) __Limitation__ 

            The Secretary shall not extend the timeline for a feasibility study for a period of more than 7 years, and any feasibility study that is not completed before that date shall no longer be authorized.

    (e) __Reviews__ 

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the initiation of a study described in subsection (a) for a project, the Secretary shall—

        (1) take all steps necessary to initiate the process for completing federally mandated reviews that the Secretary is required to complete as part of the study, including the environmental review process under section 1005;

        (2) convene a meeting of all Federal, tribal, and State agencies identified under [section 2348(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s2348/e] that may be required by law to conduct or issue a review, analysis, or opinion on or to make a determination concerning a permit or license for the study; and

        (3) take all steps necessary to provide information that will enable required reviews and analyses related to the project to be conducted by other agencies in a thorough and timely manner.
