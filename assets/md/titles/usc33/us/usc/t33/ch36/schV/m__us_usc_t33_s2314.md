## § 2314. Innovative technology

    (a) __Use__ 

    The Secretary shall, whenever feasible, seek to promote long- and short-term cost savings, increased efficiency, reliability, and safety, and improved environmental results through the use of innovative technology in all phases of water resources development projects and programs under the Secretary’s jurisdiction. To further this goal, Congress encourages the Secretary to—

        (1) use procurement and contracting procedures that encourage innovative project design, construction, rehabilitation, repair, and operation and maintenance technologies;

        (2) frequently review technical and design criteria to remove or modify unnecessary impediments to innovation;

        (3) increase timely exchange of technical information with universities, private companies, government agencies, and individuals;

        (4) foster design competition; and

        (5) encourage greater participation by non-Federal project sponsors in the development and implementation of projects.

    (b) __Accelerated adoption of innovative technologies for management of contaminated sediments__ 

        (1) __Test projects__ 

            The Secretary shall approve an appropriate number of projects to test, under actual field conditions, innovative technologies for environmentally sound management of contaminated sediments.

        (2) __Demonstration projects__ 

            The Secretary may approve an appropriate number of projects to demonstrate innovative technologies that have been pilot tested under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Conduct of projects__ 

            Each pilot project under paragraph (1) and demonstration project under paragraph (2) shall be conducted by a university with proven expertise in the research and development of contaminated sediment treatment technologies and innovative applications using waste materials.

        (4) __Location__ 

            At least 1 of the projects under this subsection shall be conducted in New England by the University of New Hampshire.

    (c) __Reports__ 

        Within 2 years after November 17, 1988, and thereafter at the Secretary’s discretion, the Secretary shall provide Congress with a report on the results of, and recommendations to increase, the development and use of innovative technology in water resources development projects under the Secretary’s jurisdiction. Such report shall also contain information regarding innovative technologies which the Secretary has considered and rejected for use in water resources development projects under the Secretary’s jurisdiction.

    (d) __“Innovative technology” defined__ 

        For the purpose of this section, the term “innovative technology” means designs, methods, or materials, including roller compacted concrete, geosynthetic materials, and advanced composites, that the Secretary determines are appropriate to carry out this section.

 __Amendments__ 

    2014—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 113–121][/us/pl/113/121] substituted “methods, or materials, including roller compacted concrete, geosynthetic materials, and advanced composites, that the Secretary determines are appropriate to carry out this section.” for “materials, or methods which the Secretary determines are previously undemonstrated or are too new to be considered standard practice.”

    1999—Subsecs. (b) to (d). [Pub. L. 106–53][/us/pl/106/53] added subsec. (b) and redesignated former subsecs. (b) and (c) as (c) and (d), respectively.

>     “(b)  __Design-Build Defined__  __.—__ 

>     In this section, the term ‘design-build’ means an agreement between the Federal Government and a contractor that provides for both the design and construction of a project by a single contract.

>     “(c)  __Report__  __.—__
