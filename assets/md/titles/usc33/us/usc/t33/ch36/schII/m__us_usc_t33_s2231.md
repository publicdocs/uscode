## § 2231. Study of water resources development projects by non-Federal interests

    (a) __Submission to Secretary__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A non-Federal interest may undertake a feasibility study of a proposed water resources development project and submit the study to the Secretary.

        (2) __Guidelines__ 

            To assist non-Federal interests, the Secretary, as soon as practicable, shall issue guidelines for feasibility studies of water resources development projects to provide sufficient information for the formulation of the studies.

    (b) __Review by Secretary__ 

        The Secretary shall review each feasibility study received under subsection (a)(1) for the purpose of determining whether or not the study, and the process under which the study was developed, each comply with Federal laws and regulations applicable to feasibility studies of water resources development projects.

    (c) __Submission to Congress__ 

    Not later than 180 days after the date of receipt of a feasibility study of a project under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report that describes—

        (1) the results of the Secretary’s review of the study under subsection (b), including a determination of whether the project is feasible;

        (2) any recommendations the Secretary may have concerning the plan or design of the project; and

        (3) any conditions the Secretary may require for construction of the project.

    (d) __Credit__ 

        If a project for which a feasibility study has been submitted under subsection (a)(1) is authorized by a Federal law enacted after the date of the submission to Congress under subsection (c), the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of construction of the project an amount equal to the portion of the cost of developing the study that would have been the responsibility of the United States if the study had been developed by the Secretary.
