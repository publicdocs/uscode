## § 2231. Studies of projects by non-Federal interests

    (a) __Submission to Secretary__ 

        A non-Federal interest may on its own undertake a feasibility study of a proposed harbor or inland harbor project and submit it to the Secretary. To assist non-Federal interests, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, promulgate guidelines for studies of harbors or inland harbors to provide sufficient information for the formulation of studies.

    (b) __Review by Secretary__ 

        The Secretary shall review each study submitted under subsection (a) of this section for the purpose of determining whether or not such study and the process under which such study was developed comply with Federal laws and regulations applicable to feasibility studies of navigation projects for harbors or inland harbors.

    (c) __Submission to Congress__ 

        Not later than 180 days after receiving any study submitted under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress, in writing, the results of such review and any recommendations the Secretary may have concerning the project described in such plan and design.

    (d) __Credit and reimbursement__ 

        If a project for which a study has been submitted under subsection (a) of this section is authorized by any provision of Federal law enacted after the date of such submission, the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of construction of such project an amount equal to the portion of the cost of developing such study that would be the responsibility of the United States if such study were developed by the Secretary.
