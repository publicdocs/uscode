        (3) ways to reduce the duration and intensity of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, including deployment of response technologies in a timely manner;

        (4) research and methods to address human health dimensions of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (5) mechanisms, including the potential costs and benefits of those mechanisms, to protect ecosystems that may be or have been affected by harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events;

        (6) mechanisms by which data, information, and products may be transferred between the Program and the State, tribal, and local governments and research entities;

        (7) communication and information dissemination methods that State, tribal, and local governments may undertake to educate and inform the public concerning harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and

        (8) roles that Federal agencies may have to assist in the implementation of the Action Strategy, including efforts to support local and regional scientific assessments under [section 4001(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s4001/e].

    (c) __Utilizing available studies and information__ 

    In developing the Action Strategy, the Under Secretary shall utilize existing research, assessments, reports, and program activities, including—
