        (3) support the implementation of the Action Strategy, including the coordination and integration of the research of all Federal programs, including ocean and Great Lakes science and management programs and centers, that address the chemical, biological, and physical components of marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (4) support the development of institutional mechanisms and financial instruments to further the objectives and activities of the Program;

        (5) review the Program’s distribution of Federal funding to address the objectives and activities of the Program;

        (6) promote the development of new technologies for predicting, monitoring, and mitigating harmful algal bloom and hypoxia conditions; and

        (2) prepare work and spending plans for implementing the research and activities identified under the Action Strategy;

        (3)

         administer peer-reviewed, merit-based, competitive grant funding—

            (A) to maintain and enhance baseline monitoring programs established by the Program;

            (B) to support the projects maintained and established by the Program; and

            (C) to address the research and management needs and priorities identified in the Action Strategy;

        (4) coordinate with and work cooperatively with regional, State, tribal, and local government agencies and programs that address marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (5) coordinate with the Secretary of State to support international efforts on marine and freshwater harmful algal bloom and hypoxia information sharing, research, prediction, mitigation, control, and response activities;

        (6) identify additional research, development, and demonstration needs and priorities relating to monitoring, prevention, control, mitigation, and response to marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, including methods and technologies to protect the ecosystems affected by marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (7) integrate, coordinate, and augment existing education programs to improve public understanding and awareness of the causes, impacts, and mitigation efforts for marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (8) facilitate and provide resources to train State and local coastal and water resource managers in the methods and technologies for monitoring, preventing, controlling, and mitigating marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (9)

         support regional efforts to control and mitigate outbreaks through—

            (A) communication of the contents of the Action Strategy and maintenance of online data portals for other information about harmful algal blooms and hypoxia to State, tribal, and local stakeholders; and

            (B) overseeing the development, review, and periodic updating of the Action Strategy;

        (10) convene at least 1 meeting of the Task Force each year; and

        (11) perform such other tasks as may be delegated by the Task Force.

    (f) __National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration activities__ 

    The Under Secretary shall—

        (1) maintain and enhance the existing competitive programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration relating to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

        (2) carry out marine and Great Lakes harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events response activities;
