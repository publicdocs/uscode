## § 4005. Great Lakes hypoxia and harmful algal blooms

    (a) __Integrated assessment__ 

    Not later than 18 months after June 30, 2014, the Task Force, in accordance with the authority under [section 4001 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s4001], shall complete and submit to the Congress and the President an integrated assessment that examines the causes, consequences, and approaches to reduce hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes, including the status of and gaps within current research, monitoring, management, prevention, response, and control activities by—

        (1) Federal agencies;

        (2) State agencies;

        (3) regional research consortia;

        (4) academia;

        (5) private industry; and

        (6) nongovernmental organizations.

    (b) __Plan__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 2 years after June 30, 2014, the Task Force shall develop and submit to the Congress a plan, based on the integrated assessment under subsection (a), for reducing, mitigating, and controlling hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes.

        (2) __Contents__ 

        The plan shall—

            (A) address the monitoring needs identified in the integrated assessment under subsection (a);

            (B) develop a timeline and budgetary requirements for deployment of future assets;

            (C)

             identify requirements for the development and verification of Great Lakes hypoxia and harmful algal bloom models, including—

                (i) all assumptions built into the models; and

                (ii) data quality methods used to ensure the best available data are utilized; and

            (D)

             describe efforts to improve the assessment of the impacts of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms by—

                (i) characterizing current and past biological conditions in ecosystems affected by hypoxia and harmful algal blooms; and

                (ii) quantifying effects, including economic effects, at the population and community levels.

        (3) __Requirements__

            (E) evaluate cost-effective, incentive-based partnership approaches;

            (F) ensure that the plan is technically sound and cost effective;

            (G) utilize existing research, assessments, reports, and program activities;

            (H) publish a summary of the proposed plan in the Federal Register at least 180 days prior to submitting the completed plan to Congress; and
