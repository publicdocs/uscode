In the event of the violation of any such rules and regulations by the owner, master, or person in charge of any vessel, such owner, master, or person in charge of such vessel shall be liable to a penalty of up to $10,000. Each day during which a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. The said vessel may be holden for the payment of such penalty, and may be seized and proceeded against summarily by libel for the recovery of the same in any United States district court for the district within which such vessel may be and in the name of the officer designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    “Coast Guard” and “Coast Guard vessel” substituted in text for “Revenue Cutter Service” and “revenue cutter”, respectively, the Revenue Cutter Service and Life-Saving Service having been combined to form the Coast Guard by [act Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20][/us/act/1915-01-28/ch20], § 1, [38 Stat. 800][/us/stat/38/800].

[Section 6(b)(2) of Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670/s6/b/2], however, provided that notwithstanding such transfer of functions, the Coast Guard shall operate as part of the Navy in time of war or when President directs as provided in [section 3 of Title 14][/us/usc/t14/s3], Coast Guard. See [section 108 of Title 49][/us/usc/t49/s108], Transportation. For subsequent transfers relating to the Secretary of Transportation and the Coast Guard, see below.

[Pub. L. 97–449][/us/pl/97/449] amended this section to reflect the transfer made by [section 6(g)(1)(A) of Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670/s6/g/1/A], and repealed section 6(g)(1)(A).

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
