## § 1412. Dumping permit program

    (a) __Environmental Protection Agency permits__ 

    Except in relation to dredged material, as provided for in [section 1413 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413], and in relation to radiological, chemical, and biological warfare agents, high-level radioactive waste, and medical waste, for which no permit may be issued, the Administrator may issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearings, for the transportation from the United States or, in the case of an agency or instrumentality of the United States, or in the case of a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag, for the transportation from a location outside the United States, of material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters, or for the dumping of material into the waters described in [section 1411(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1411/b], where the Administrator determines that such dumping will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities. The Administrator shall establish and apply criteria for reviewing and evaluating such permit applications, and, in establishing or revising such criteria, shall consider, but not be limited in his consideration to, the following :

        (A) The need for the proposed dumping.

        (B) The effect of such dumping on human health and welfare, including economic, esthetic, and recreational values.

        (C) The effect of such dumping on fisheries resources, plankton, fish, shellfish, wildlife, shore lines and beaches.

        (D)

         The effect of such dumping on marine ecosystems, particularly with respect to—

            (i) the transfer, concentration, and dispersion of such material and its byproducts through biological, physical, and chemical processes.

            (ii) potential changes in marine ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability, and

            (iii) species and community population dynamics.

        (E) The persistence and permanence of the effects of the dumping.

        (F) The effect of dumping particular volumes and concentrations of such materials.

        (G) Appropriate locations and methods of disposal or recycling, including land-based alternatives and the probable impact of requiring use of such alternate locations or methods upon considerations affecting the public interest.

        (H) The effect on alternate uses of oceans, such as scientific study, fishing, and other living resource exploitation, and non-living resource exploitation.

        (I) In designating recommended sites, the Administrator shall utilize wherever feasible locations beyond the edge of the Continental Shelf.

        In establishing or revising such criteria, the Administrator shall consult with Federal, State, and local officials, and interested members of the general public, as may appear appropriate to the Administrator. With respect to such criteria as may affect the civil works program of the Department of the Army, the Administrator shall also consult with the Secretary. In reviewing applications for permits, the Administrator shall make such provision for consultation with interested Federal and State agencies as he deems useful or necessary. No permit shall be issued for a dumping of material which will violate applicable water quality standards. To the extent that he may do so without relaxing the requirements of this subchapter, the Administrator, in establishing or revising such criteria, shall apply the standards and criteria binding upon the United States under the Convention, including its Annexes.

    (b) __Permit categories__ 

        The Administrator may establish and issue various categories of permits, including the general permits described in [section 1414(c) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1414/c].

    (c) __Designation of sites__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Administrator shall, in a manner consistent with the criteria established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, designate sites or time periods for dumping. The Administrator shall designate sites or time periods for dumping that will mitigate adverse impact on the environment to the greatest extent practicable.

        (2) __Prohibitions regarding site or time period__ 

            In any case where the Administrator determines that, with respect to certain materials, it is necessary to prohibit dumping at a site or during a time period, the Administrator shall prohibit the dumping of such materials in such site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during the time period, including any dumping under [section 1413(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413/e].

        (3) __Dredged material disposal sites__ 

        In the case of dredged material disposal sites, the Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary, shall develop a site management plan for each site designated pursuant to this section. In developing such plans, the Administrator and the Secretary shall provide opportunity for public comment. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to—

            (A) a baseline assessment of conditions at the site;

            (B) a program for monitoring the site;

            (C) special management conditions or practices to be implemented at each site that are necessary for protection of the environment;

            (D) consideration of the quantity of the material to be disposed of at the site, and the presence, nature, and bioavailability of the contaminants in the material;

            (E) consideration of the anticipated use of the site over the long term, including the anticipated closure date for the site, if applicable, and any need for management of the site after the closure of the site; and

            (F) a schedule for review and revision of the plan (which shall not be reviewed and revised less frequently than 10 years after adoption of the plan, and every 10 years thereafter).

        (4) __General site management plan requirement; prohibitions__ 

            After January 1, 1995, no site shall receive a final designation unless a management plan has been developed pursuant to this section. Beginning on January 1, 1997, no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under [section 1413(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413/e] shall be issued for a site (other than the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as “LA–3”) unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to [section 1413(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413/b]. Beginning January 1, 2011, no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under [section 1413(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413/e] shall be issued for the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as “LA–3”, unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to [section 1413(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1413/b].

        (5) __Management plans for previously designated sites__ 

            The Administrator shall develop a site management plan for any site designated prior to January 1, 1995, as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than January 1, 1997, giving priority consideration to management plans for designated sites that are considered to have the greatest impact on the environment.

    (d) __Fish wastes__ 

        No permit is required under this subchapter for the transportation for dumping or the dumping of fish wastes, except when deposited in harbors or other protected or enclosed coastal waters, or where the Administrator finds that such deposits could endanger health, the environment, or ecological systems in a specific location. Where the Administrator makes such a finding, such material may be deposited only as authorized by a permit issued by the Administrator under this section.

    (e) __Foreign State permits; acceptance__ 

        In the case of transportation of material, by an agency or instrumentality of the United States or by a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag, from a location in a foreign State Party to the Convention, a permit issued pursuant to the authority of that foreign State Party, in accordance with Convention requirements, and which otherwise could have been issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, shall be accepted, for the purposes of this subchapter, as if it were issued by the Administrator under the authority of this section: Provided, That in the case of an agency or instrumentality of the United States, no application shall be made for a permit to be issued pursuant to the authority of a foreign State Party to the Convention unless the Administrator concurs in the filing of such application.
