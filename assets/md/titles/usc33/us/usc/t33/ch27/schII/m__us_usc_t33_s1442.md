            (C) continuing monitoring programs to assess the health of the marine environment, including but not limited to the monitoring of bottom oxygen concentrations, contaminant levels in biota, sediments, and the water column, diseases in fish and shellfish, and changes in types and abundance of indicator species;

            (D) the development of methodologies, techniques, and equipment for disposal of waste materials to minimize degradation of the marine environment.

        (3) The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the comprehensive and continuing research program conducted under this subsection is consistent with the comprehensive plan for ocean pollution research and development and monitoring prepared under section 1703  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.
