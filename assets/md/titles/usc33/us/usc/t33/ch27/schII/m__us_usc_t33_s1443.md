## § 1443. Research program respecting ocean dumping and other methods of waste disposal

    (a) __Cooperation with public authorities, agencies, and institutions, private agencies and institutions, and individuals__ 

    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall—

        (1)

         conduct research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, surveys, and studies for the purpose of—

            (A) determining means of minimizing or ending, as soon as possible after October 6, 1980, the dumping into ocean waters, or waters described in [section 1411(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1411/b], of material which may unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities, and

            (B) developing disposal methods as alternatives to the dumping described in subparagraph (A); and

        (2) encourage, cooperate with, promote the coordination of, and render financial and other assistance to appropriate public authorities, agencies, and institutions (whether Federal, State, interstate, or local) and appropriate private agencies, institutions, and individuals in the conduct of research and other activities described in paragraph (1).

    (b) __Termination date for ocean dumping of sewage sludge not affected__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect in any way the December 31, 1981, termination date, established in [section 1412a of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1412a], for the ocean dumping of sewage sludge.

    (c) __Regional management plans for waste disposal__ 

    The Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, and other officials of appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, shall assess the feasibility in coastal areas of regional management plans for the disposal of waste materials. Such plans should integrate where appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local waste disposal activities into a comprehensive regional disposal strategy. These plans should address, among other things—

        (1) the sources, quantities, and types of materials that require and will require disposal;

        (2) the environmental, economic, social, and human health factors (and the methods used to assess these factors) associated with disposal alternatives;

        (3) the improvements in production processes, methods of disposal, and recycling to reduce the adverse effects associated with such disposal alternatives;

        (4) the applicable laws and regulations governing waste disposal; and

        (5) improvements in permitting processes to reduce administrative burdens.

    (d) __Report on sewage disposal in New York metropolitan area__ 

    The Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to the Congress and the President, not later than one year after April 7, 1986, a report on sewage sludge disposal in the New York City metropolitan region. The report shall—

        (1) consider the factors listed in subsection (c) of this section as they relate to landfilling, incineration, ocean dumping, or any other feasible disposal or reuse/recycling option;

        (2) include an assessment of the cost of these alternatives; and

        (3) recommend such regulatory or legislative changes as may be necessary to reduce the adverse impacts associated with sewage sludge disposal.

L. 92–532][/us/pl/92/532], which was approved Oct. 23, 1972, and inserted provision directing that nothing in this section be construed to affect in any way the Dec. 31, 1981, termination date, established by [section 1412a of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1412a] for ocean dumping of sewage sludge.
