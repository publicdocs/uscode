## § 1377. Indian tribes

    (a) __Policy__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the application of [section 1251(g) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1251/g], and all of the provisions of this section shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of such [section 1251(g) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1251/g]. Indian tribes shall be treated as States for purposes of such [section 1251(g) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1251/g].

    (b) __Assessment of sewage treatment needs; report__ 

        The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director of the Indian Health Service, shall assess the need for sewage treatment works to serve Indian tribes, the degree to which such needs will be met through funds allotted to States under [section 1285 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1285] and priority lists under [section 1296 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1296], and any obstacles which prevent such needs from being met. Not later than one year after February 4, 1987, the Administrator shall submit a report to Congress on the assessment under this subsection, along with recommendations specifying (1) how the Administrator intends to provide assistance to Indian tribes to develop waste treatment management plans and to construct treatment works under this chapter, and (2) methods by which the participation in and administration of programs under this chapter by Indian tribes can be maximized.

    (c) __Reservation of funds__ 

        The Administrator shall reserve each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1986, before allotments to the States under [section 1285(e) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1285/e], one-half of one percent of the sums appropriated under [section 1287 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1287]. Sums reserved under this subsection shall be available only for grants for the development of waste treatment management plans and for the construction of sewage treatment works to serve Indian tribes, as defined in subsection (h) of this section and former Indian reservations in Oklahoma (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) and Alaska Native Villages as defined in [Public Law 92–203][/us/pl/92/203] \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\].

    (d) __Cooperative agreements__ 

        In order to ensure the consistent implementation of the requirements of this chapter, an Indian tribe and the State or States in which the lands of such tribe are located may enter into a cooperative agreement, subject to the review and approval of the Administrator, to jointly plan and administer the requirements of this chapter.

    (e) __Treatment as States__ 

    The Administrator is authorized to treat an Indian tribe as a State for purposes of subchapter II of this chapter and sections 1254, 1256, 1313, 1315, 1318, 1319, 1324, 1329, 1341, 1342, 1344, and 1346 of this title to the degree necessary to carry out the objectives of this section, but only if—

        (1) the Indian tribe has a governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers;

        (2) the functions to be exercised by the Indian tribe pertain to the management and protection of water resources which are held by an Indian tribe, held by the United States in trust for Indians, held by a member of an Indian tribe if such property interest is subject to a trust restriction on alienation, or otherwise within the borders of an Indian reservation; and

        (3) the Indian tribe is reasonably expected to be capable, in the Administrator’s judgment, of carrying out the functions to be exercised in a manner consistent with the terms and purposes of this chapter and of all applicable regulations.

        Such treatment as a State may include the direct provision of funds reserved under subsection (c) of this section to the governing bodies of Indian tribes, and the determination of priorities by Indian tribes, where not determined by the Administrator in cooperation with the Director of the Indian Health Service. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director of the Indian Health Service, is authorized to make grants under subchapter II of this chapter in an amount not to exceed 100 percent of the cost of a project. Not later than 18 months after February 4, 1987, the Administrator shall, in consultation with Indian tribes, promulgate final regulations which specify how Indian tribes shall be treated as States for purposes of this chapter. The Administrator shall, in promulgating such regulations, consult affected States sharing common water bodies and provide a mechanism for the resolution of any unreasonable consequences that may arise as a result of differing water quality standards that may be set by States and Indian tribes located on common bodies of water. Such mechanism shall provide for explicit consideration of relevant factors including, but not limited to, the effects of differing water quality permit requirements on upstream and downstream dischargers, economic impacts, and present and historical uses and quality of the waters subject to such standards. Such mechanism should provide for the avoidance of such unreasonable consequences in a manner consistent with the objective of this chapter.

    (f) __Grants for nonpoint source programs__ 

        The Administrator shall make grants to an Indian tribe under [section 1329 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1329] as though such tribe was a State. Not more than one-third of one percent of the amount appropriated for any fiscal year under [section 1329 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1329] may be used to make grants under this subsection. In addition to the requirements of [section 1329 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1329], an Indian tribe shall be required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (d)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be subsection “(e)”. </sup></sup>  of this section in order to receive such a grant.

    (g) __Alaska Native organizations__ 

    No provision of this chapter shall be construed to—

        (1) grant, enlarge, or diminish, or in any way affect the scope of the governmental authority, if any, of any Alaska Native organization, including any federally-recognized tribe, traditional Alaska Native council, or Native council organized pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 ([48 Stat. 987][/us/stat/48/987]), over lands or persons in Alaska;

        (2) create or validate any assertion by such organization or any form of governmental authority over lands or persons in Alaska; or

        (3) in any way affect any assertion that Indian country, as defined in [section 1151 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1151], exists or does not exist in Alaska.

    (h) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term—

        (1) “Federal Indian reservation” means all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation; and

        (2) “Indian tribe” means any Indian tribe, band, group, or community recognized by the Secretary of the Interior and exercising governmental authority over a Federal Indian reservation.
