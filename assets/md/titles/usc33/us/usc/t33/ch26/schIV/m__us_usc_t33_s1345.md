## § 1345. Disposal or use of sewage sludge

    (a) __Permit__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law, in any case where the disposal of sewage sludge resulting from the operation of a treatment works as defined in [section 1292 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1292] (including the removal of in-place sewage sludge from one location and its deposit at another location) would result in any pollutant from such sewage sludge entering the navigable waters, such disposal is prohibited except in accordance with a permit issued by the Administrator under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342].

    (b) __Issuance of permit; regulations__ 

        The Administrator shall issue regulations governing the issuance of permits for the disposal of sewage sludge subject to subsection (a) of this section and [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342]. Such regulations shall require the application to such disposal of each criterion, factor, procedure, and requirement applicable to a permit issued under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342].

    (c) __State permit program__ 

        Each State desiring to administer its own permit program for disposal of sewage sludge subject to subsection (a) of this section within its jurisdiction may do so in accordance with [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342].

    (d) __Regulations__ 

        (1) __Regulations__ 

        The Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons, shall develop and publish, within one year after December 27, 1977, and from time to time thereafter, regulations providing guidelines for the disposal of sludge and the utilization of sludge for various purposes. Such regulations shall—

            (A) identify uses for sludge, including disposal;

            (B) specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs);

            (C) identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal.

            The Administrator is authorized to revise any regulation issued under this subsection.

        (2) __Identification and regulation of toxic pollutants__ 

            (A) __On basis of available information__ 

                (i) __Proposed regulations__ 

                    Not later than November 30, 1986, the Administrator shall identify those toxic pollutants which, on the basis of available information on their toxicity, persistence, concentration, mobility, or potential for exposure, may be present in sewage sludge in concentrations which may adversely affect public health or the environment, and propose regulations specifying acceptable management practices for sewage sludge containing each such toxic pollutant and establishing numerical limitations for each such pollutant for each use identified under paragraph (1)(A).

                (ii) __Final regulations__ 

                    Not later than August 31, 1987, and after opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator shall promulgate the regulations required by subparagraph (A)(i).

            (B) __Others__ 

                (i) __Proposed regulations__ 

                    Not later than July 31, 1987, the Administrator shall identify those toxic pollutants not identified under subparagraph (A)(i) which may be present in sewage sludge in concentrations which may adversely affect public health or the environment, and propose regulations specifying acceptable management practices for sewage sludge containing each such toxic pollutant and establishing numerical limitations for each pollutant for each such use identified under paragraph (1)(A).

                (ii) __Final regulations__ 

                    Not later than June 15, 1988, the Administrator shall promulgate the regulations required by subparagraph (B)(i).

            (C) __Review__ 

                From time to time, but not less often than every 2 years, the Administrator shall review the regulations promulgated under this paragraph for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutants and promulgating regulations for such pollutants consistent with the requirements of this paragraph.

            (D) __Minimum standards; compliance date__ 

                The management practices and numerical criteria established under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall be adequate to protect public health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of each pollutant. Such regulations shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than 12 months after their publication, unless such regulations require the construction of new pollution control facilities, in which case the regulations shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than two years from the date of their publication.

        (3) __Alternative standards__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, if, in the judgment of the Administrator, it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical limitation for a pollutant identified under paragraph (2), the Administrator may instead promulgate a design, equipment, management practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, which in the Administrator’s judgment is adequate to protect public health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of such pollutant. In the event the Administrator promulgates a design or equipment standard under this subsection, the Administrator shall include as part of such standard such requirements as will assure the proper operation and maintenance of any such element of design or equipment.

        (4) __Conditions on permits__ 

            Prior to the promulgation of the regulations required by paragraph (2), the Administrator shall impose conditions in permits issued to publicly owned treatment works under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342] or take such other measures as the Administrator deems appropriate to protect public health and the environment from any adverse effects which may occur from toxic pollutants in sewage sludge.

        (5) __Limitation on statutory construction__ 

            Nothing in this section is intended to waive more stringent requirements established by this chapter or any other law.

    (e) __Manner of sludge disposal__ 

        The determination of the manner of disposal or use of sludge is a local determination, except that it shall be unlawful for any person to dispose of sludge from a publicly owned treatment works or any other treatment works treating domestic sewage for any use for which regulations have been established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, except in accordance with such regulations.

    (f) __Implementation of regulations__ 

        (1) __Through section 1342 permits__ 

            Any permit issued under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342] to a publicly owned treatment works or any other treatment works treating domestic sewage shall include requirements for the use and disposal of sludge that implement the regulations established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, unless such requirements have been included in a permit issued under the appropriate provisions of subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6921][/us/usc/t42/s6921] et seq.\], part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act \[[42 U.S.C. 300h][/us/usc/t42/s300h] et seq.\], the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 \[[16 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t16/s1431] et seq., 1447 et seq.; [33 U.S.C. 1401][/us/usc/t33/s1401] et seq., 2801 et seq.\], or the Clean Air Act \[[42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.\], or under State permit programs approved by the Administrator, where the Administrator determines that such programs assure compliance with any applicable requirements of this section. Not later than December 15, 1986, the Administrator shall promulgate procedures for approval of State programs pursuant to this paragraph.

        (2) __Through other permits__ 

            In the case of a treatment works described in paragraph (1) that is not subject to [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342] and to which none of the other above listed permit programs nor approved State permit authority apply, the Administrator may issue a permit to such treatment works solely to impose requirements for the use and disposal of sludge that implement the regulations established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The Administrator shall include in the permit appropriate requirements to assure compliance with the regulations established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The Administrator shall establish procedures for issuing permits pursuant to this paragraph.
