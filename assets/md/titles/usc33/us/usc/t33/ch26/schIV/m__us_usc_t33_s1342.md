## § 1342. National pollutant discharge elimination system

    (a) __Permits for discharge of pollutants__ 

        (1) Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344 of this title, the Administrator may, after opportunity for public hearing issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, or combination of pollutants, notwithstanding [section 1311(a) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311/a], upon condition that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable requirements under sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, 1318, and 1343 of this title, or (B) prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all such requirements, such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

        (2) The Administrator shall prescribe conditions for such permits to assure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection, including conditions on data and information collection, reporting, and such other requirements as he deems appropriate.

        (3) The permit program of the Administrator under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and permits issued thereunder, shall be subject to the same terms, conditions, and requirements as apply to a State permit program and permits issued thereunder under subsection (b) of this section.

        (4) All permits for discharges into the navigable waters issued pursuant to [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407] shall be deemed to be permits issued under this subchapter, and permits issued under this subchapter shall be deemed to be permits issued under [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407], and shall continue in force and effect for their term unless revoked, modified, or suspended in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

        (5) No permit for a discharge into the navigable waters shall be issued under [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407] after October 18, 1972. Each application for a permit under [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407], pending on October 18, 1972, shall be deemed to be an application for a permit under this section. The Administrator shall authorize a State, which he determines has the capability of administering a permit program which will carry out the objectives of this chapter to issue permits for discharges into the navigable waters within the jurisdiction of such State. The Administrator may exercise the authority granted him by the preceding sentence only during the period which begins on October 18, 1972, and ends either on the ninetieth day after the date of the first promulgation of guidelines required by [section 1314(i)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314/i/2], or the date of approval by the Administrator of a permit program for such State under subsection (b) of this section, whichever date first occurs, and no such authorization to a State shall extend beyond the last day of such period. Each such permit shall be subject to such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. No such permit shall issue if the Administrator objects to such issuance.

    (b) __State permit programs__ 

    At any time after the promulgation of the guidelines required by subsection (i)(2) of [section 1314 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314], the Governor of each State desiring to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law or under an interstate compact. In addition, such State shall submit a statement from the attorney general (or the attorney for those State water pollution control agencies which have independent legal counsel), or from the chief legal officer in the case of an interstate agency, that the laws of such State, or the interstate compact, as the case may be, provide adequate authority to carry out the described program. The Administrator shall approve each submitted program unless he determines that adequate authority does not exist:

        (1)

         To issue permits which—

            (A) apply, and insure compliance with, any applicable requirements of sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, and 1343 of this title;

            (B) are for fixed terms not exceeding five years; and

            (C)

             can be terminated or modified for cause including, but not limited to, the following:

                (i) violation of any condition of the permit;

                (ii) obtaining a permit by misrepresentation, or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts;

                (iii) change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge;

            (D) control the disposal of pollutants into wells;

        (2)

            (A) To issue permits which apply, and insure compliance with, all applicable requirements of [section 1318 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1318]; or

            (B) To inspect, monitor, enter, and require reports to at least the same extent as required in [section 1318 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1318];

        (3) To insure that the public, and any other State the waters of which may be affected, receive notice of each application for a permit and to provide an opportunity for public hearing before a ruling on each such application;

        (4) To insure that the Administrator receives notice of each application (including a copy thereof) for a permit;

        (5) To insure that any State (other than the permitting State), whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendations to the permitting State (and the Administrator) with respect to any permit application and, if any part of such written recommendations are not accepted by the permitting State, that the permitting State will notify such affected State (and the Administrator) in writing of its failure to so accept such recommendations together with its reasons for so doing;

        (6) To insure that no permit will be issued if, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers, after consultation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, anchorage and navigation of any of the navigable waters would be substantially impaired thereby;

        (7) To abate violations of the permit or the permit program, including civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of enforcement;

        (8) To insure that any permit for a discharge from a publicly owned treatment works includes conditions to require the identification in terms of character and volume of pollutants of any significant source introducing pollutants subject to pretreatment standards under [section 1317(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1317/b] into such works and a program to assure compliance with such pretreatment standards by each such source, in addition to adequate notice to the permitting agency of (A) new introductions into such works of pollutants from any source which would be a new source as defined in [section 1316 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1316] if such source were discharging pollutants, (B) new introductions of pollutants into such works from a source which would be subject to [section 1311 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311] if it were discharging such pollutants, or (C) a substantial change in volume or character of pollutants being introduced into such works by a source introducing pollutants into such works at the time of issuance of the permit. Such notice shall include information on the quality and quantity of effluent to be introduced into such treatment works and any anticipated impact of such change in the quantity or quality of effluent to be discharged from such publicly owned treatment works; and

        (9) To insure that any industrial user of any publicly owned treatment works will comply with sections 1284(b), 1317, and 1318 of this title.

    (c) __Suspension of Federal program upon submission of State program; withdrawal of approval of State program; return of State program to Administrator__ 

        (1) Not later than ninety days after the date on which a State has submitted a program (or revision thereof) pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of permits under subsection (a) of this section as to those discharges subject to such program unless he determines that the State permit program does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section or does not conform to the guidelines issued under [section 1314(i)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314/i/2]. If the Administrator so determines, he shall notify the State of any revisions or modifications necessary to conform to such requirements or guidelines.

        (2) Any State permit program under this section shall at all times be in accordance with this section and guidelines promulgated pursuant to [section 1314(i)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314/i/2].

        (3) Whenever the Administrator determines after public hearing that a State is not administering a program approved under this section in accordance with requirements of this section, he shall so notify the State and, if appropriate corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed ninety days, the Administrator shall withdraw approval of such program. The Administrator shall not withdraw approval of any such program unless he shall first have notified the State, and made public, in writing, the reasons for such withdrawal.

        (4)  __Limitations on partial permit program returns and withdrawals__  __.—__ 

        A State may return to the Administrator administration, and the Administrator may withdraw under paragraph (3) of this subsection approval, of—

            (A) a State partial permit program approved under subsection (n)(3) of this section only if the entire permit program being administered by the State department or agency at the time is returned or withdrawn; and

            (B) a State partial permit program approved under subsection (n)(4) of this section only if an entire phased component of the permit program being administered by the State at the time is returned or withdrawn.

    (d) __Notification of Administrator__ 

        (1) Each State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of each permit application received by such State and provide notice to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of such permit application, including each permit proposed to be issued by such State.

        (2) No permit shall issue (A) if the Administrator within ninety days of the date of his notification under subsection (b)(5) of this section objects in writing to the issuance of such permit, or (B) if the Administrator within ninety days of the date of transmittal of the proposed permit by the State objects in writing to the issuance of such permit as being outside the guidelines and requirements of this chapter. Whenever the Administrator objects to the issuance of a permit under this paragraph such written objection shall contain a statement of the reasons for such objection and the effluent limitations and conditions which such permit would include if it were issued by the Administrator.

        (3) The Administrator may, as to any permit application, waive paragraph (2) of this subsection.

        (4) In any case where, after December 27, 1977, the Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, objects to the issuance of a permit, on request of the State, a public hearing shall be held by the Administrator on such objection. If the State does not resubmit such permit revised to meet such objection within 30 days after completion of the hearing, or, if no hearing is requested within 90 days after the date of such objection, the Administrator may issue the permit pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for such source in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of this chapter.

    (e) __Waiver of notification requirement__ 

        In accordance with guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of [section 1314 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314], the Administrator is authorized to waive the requirements of subsection (d) of this section at the time he approves a program pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for any category (including any class, type, or size within such category) of point sources within the State submitting such program.

    (f) __Point source categories__ 

        The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing categories of point sources which he determines shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section in any State with a program approved pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes within any category of point sources.

    (g) __Other regulations for safe transportation, handling, carriage, storage, and stowage of pollutants__ 

        Any permit issued under this section for the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters from a vessel or other floating craft shall be subject to any applicable regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, establishing specifications for safe transportation, handling, carriage, storage, and stowage of pollutants.

    (h) __Violation of permit conditions; restriction or prohibition upon introduction of pollutant by source not previously utilizing treatment works__ 

        In the event any condition of a permit for discharges from a treatment works (as defined in [section 1292 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1292]) which is publicly owned is violated, a State with a program approved under subsection (b) of this section or the Administrator, where no State program is approved or where the Administrator determines pursuant to [section 1319(a) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1319/a] that a State with an approved program has not commenced appropriate enforcement action with respect to such permit, may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction to restrict or prohibit the introduction of any pollutant into such treatment works by a source not utilizing such treatment works prior to the finding that such condition was violated.

    (i) __Federal enforcement not limited__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to take action pursuant to [section 1319 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1319].

    (j) __Public information__ 

        A copy of each permit application and each permit issued under this section shall be available to the public. Such permit application or permit, or portion thereof, shall further be available on request for the purpose of reproduction.

    (k) __Compliance with permits__ 

        Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance, for purposes of sections 1319 and 1365 of this title, with sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, and 1343 of this title, except any standard imposed under [section 1317 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1317] for a toxic pollutant injurious to human health. Until December 31, 1974, in any case where a permit for discharge has been applied for pursuant to this section, but final administrative disposition of such application has not been made, such discharge shall not be a violation of (1) section 1311, 1316, or 1342 of this title, or (2) [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407], unless the Administrator or other plaintiff proves that final administrative disposition of such application has not been made because of the failure of the applicant to furnish information reasonably required or requested in order to process the application. For the 180-day period beginning on October 18, 1972, in the case of any point source discharging any pollutant or combination of pollutants immediately prior to such date which source is not subject to [section 407 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s407], the discharge by such source shall not be a violation of this chapter if such a source applies for a permit for discharge pursuant to this section within such 180-day period.

    (l) __Limitation on permit requirement__ 

        (1) __Agricultural return flows__ 

            The Administrator shall not require a permit under this section for discharges composed entirely of return flows from irrigated agriculture, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly, require any State to require such a permit.

        (2) __Stormwater runoff from oil, gas, and mining operations__ 

            The Administrator shall not require a permit under this section, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly require any State to require a permit, for discharges of stormwater runoff from mining operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations or transmission facilities, composed entirely of flows which are from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including but not limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for collecting and conveying precipitation runoff and which are not contaminated by contact with, or do not come into contact with, any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished product, byproduct, or waste products located on the site of such operations.

        (3) __Silvicultural activities__ 

            (A)  __NPDES permit requirements for silvicultural activities__  __.—__ 

            The Administrator shall not require a permit under this section nor directly or indirectly require any State to require a permit under this section for a discharge from runoff resulting from the conduct of the following silviculture activities conducted in accordance with standard industry practice: nursery operations, site preparation, reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment, thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road construction and maintenance.

            (B)  __Other requirements__  __.—__ 

            Nothing in this paragraph exempts a discharge from silvicultural activity from any permitting requirement under [section 1344 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1344], existing permitting requirements under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1342], or from any other federal law.

            (C) The authorization provided in Section  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized. </sup></sup>  1365(a) of this title does not apply to any non-permitting program established under 1342(p)(6)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be preceded by “section”. </sup></sup>  of this title for the silviculture activities listed in 1342(l)(3)(A)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  of this title, or to any other limitations that might be deemed to apply to the silviculture activities listed in 1342(l)(3)(A)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  of this title.

    (m) __Additional pretreatment of conventional pollutants not required__ 

        To the extent a treatment works (as defined in [section 1292 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1292]) which is publicly owned is not meeting the requirements of a permit issued under this section for such treatment works as a result of inadequate design or operation of such treatment works, the Administrator, in issuing a permit under this section, shall not require pretreatment by a person introducing conventional pollutants identified pursuant to [section 1314(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314/a/4] into such treatment works other than pretreatment required to assure compliance with pretreatment standards under subsection (b)(8) of this section and [section 1317(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1317/b/1]. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the Administrator’s authority under sections 1317 and 1319 of this title, affect State and local authority under sections 1317(b)(4) and 1370 of this title, relieve such treatment works of its obligations to meet requirements established under this chapter, or otherwise preclude such works from pursuing whatever feasible options are available to meet its responsibility to comply with its permit under this section.

    (n) __Partial permit program__ 

        (1) __State submission__ 

            The Governor of a State may submit under subsection (b) of this section a permit program for a portion of the discharges into the navigable waters in such State.

        (2) __Minimum coverage__ 

            A partial permit program under this subsection shall cover, at a minimum, administration of a major category of the discharges into the navigable waters of the State or a major component of the permit program required by subsection (b) of this section.

        (3) __Approval of major category partial permit programs__ 

        The Administrator may approve a partial permit program covering administration of a major category of discharges under this subsection if—

            (A) such program represents a complete permit program and covers all of the discharges under the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the State; and

            (B) the Administrator determines that the partial program represents a significant and identifiable part of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section.

        (4) __Approval of major component partial permit programs__ 

        The Administrator may approve under this subsection a partial and phased permit program covering administration of a major component (including discharge categories) of a State permit program required by subsection (b) of this section if—

            (A) the Administrator determines that the partial program represents a significant and identifiable part of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section; and

            (B) the State submits, and the Administrator approves, a plan for the State to assume administration by phases of the remainder of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section by a specified date not more than 5 years after submission of the partial program under this subsection and agrees to make all reasonable efforts to assume such administration by such date.

    (o) __Anti-backsliding__ 

        (1) __General prohibition__ 

            In the case of effluent limitations established on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified on the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under [section 1314(b) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1314/b] subsequent to the original issuance of such permit, to contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit. In the case of effluent limitations established on the basis of section 1311(b)(1)(C) or section 1313(d) or (e) of this title, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit except in compliance with [section 1313(d)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1313/d/4].

        (2) __Exceptions__ 

        A permit with respect to which paragraph (1) applies may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant if—

            (A) material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of a less stringent effluent limitation;

            (B)

                (i) information is available which was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and which would have justified the application of a less stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit issuance; or

                (ii) the Administrator determines that technical mistakes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in issuing the permit under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section;

            (C) a less stringent effluent limitation is necessary because of events over which the permittee has no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;

            (D) the permittee has received a permit modification under section 1311(c), 1311(g), 1311(h), 1311(i), 1311(k), 1311(n), or 1326(a) of this title; or

            (E) the permittee has installed the treatment facilities required to meet the effluent limitations in the previous permit and has properly operated and maintained the facilities but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the previous effluent limitations, in which case the limitations in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time of permit renewal, reissuance, or modification).

            Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any revised waste load allocations or any alternative grounds for translating water quality standards into effluent limitations, except where the cumulative effect of such revised allocations results in a decrease in the amount of pollutants discharged into the concerned waters, and such revised allocations are not the result of a discharger eliminating or substantially reducing its discharge of pollutants due to complying with the requirements of this chapter or for reasons otherwise unrelated to water quality.

        (3) __Limitations__ 

            In no event may a permit with respect to which paragraph (1) applies be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit is renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a permit to discharge into waters be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation if the implementation of such limitation would result in a violation of a water quality standard under [section 1313 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1313] applicable to such waters.

    (p) __Municipal and industrial stormwater discharges__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            Prior to October 1, 1994, the Administrator or the State (in the case of a permit program approved under this section) shall not require a permit under this section for discharges composed entirely of stormwater.

        (2) __Exceptions__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the following stormwater discharges:

            (A) A discharge with respect to which a permit has been issued under this section before February 4, 1987.

            (B) A discharge associated with industrial activity.

            (C) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving a population of 250,000 or more.

            (D) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving a population of 100,000 or more but less than 250,000.

            (E) A discharge for which the Administrator or the State, as the case may be, determines that the stormwater discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United States.

        (3) __Permit requirements__ 

            (A) __Industrial discharges__ 

                Permits for discharges associated with industrial activity shall meet all applicable provisions of this section and [section 1311 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311].

            (B) __Municipal discharge__ 

            Permits for discharges from municipal storm sewers—

                (i) may be issued on a system- or jurisdiction-wide basis;

                (ii) shall include a requirement to effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges into the storm sewers; and

                (iii) shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the Administrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.

        (4) __Permit application requirements__ 

            (A) __Industrial and large municipal discharges__ 

                Not later than 2 years after February 4, 1987, the Administrator shall establish regulations setting forth the permit application requirements for stormwater discharges described in paragraphs (2)(B) and (2)(C). Applications for permits for such discharges shall be filed no later than 3 years after February 4, 1987. Not later than 4 years after February 4, 1987, the Administrator or the State, as the case may be, shall issue or deny each such permit. Any such permit shall provide for compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the date of issuance of such permit.

            (B) __Other municipal discharges__ 

                Not later than 4 years after February 4, 1987, the Administrator shall establish regulations setting forth the permit application requirements for stormwater discharges described in paragraph (2)(D). Applications for permits for such discharges shall be filed no later than 5 years after February 4, 1987. Not later than 6 years after February 4, 1987, the Administrator or the State, as the case may be, shall issue or deny each such permit. Any such permit shall provide for compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the date of issuance of such permit.

        (5) __Studies__ 

        The Administrator, in consultation with the States, shall conduct a study for the purposes of—

            (A) identifying those stormwater discharges or classes of stormwater discharges for which permits are not required pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection;

            (B) determining, to the maximum extent practicable, the nature and extent of pollutants in such discharges; and

            (C) establishing procedures and methods to control stormwater discharges to the extent necessary to mitigate impacts on water quality.

            Not later than October 1, 1988, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study described in subparagraphs (A) and (B). Not later than October 1, 1989, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study described in subparagraph (C).

The program shall, at a minimum, (A) establish priorities, (B) establish requirements for State stormwater management programs, and (C) establish expeditious deadlines. The program may include performance standards, guidelines, guidance, and management practices and treatment requirements, as appropriate.

    (q) __Combined sewer overflows__ 

        (1) __Requirement for permits, orders, and decrees__ 

            Each permit, order, or decree issued pursuant to this chapter after December 21, 2000, for a discharge from a municipal combined storm and sanitary sewer shall conform to the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy signed by the Administrator on April 11, 1994 (in this subsection referred to as the “CSO control policy”).

        (2) __Water quality and designated use review guidance__ 

            Not later than July 31, 2001, and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, the Administrator shall issue guidance to facilitate the conduct of water quality and designated use reviews for municipal combined sewer overflow receiving waters.

        (3) __Report__ 

            Not later than September 1, 2001, the Administrator shall transmit to Congress a report on the progress made by the Environmental Protection Agency, States, and municipalities in implementing and enforcing the CSO control policy.

    (r) __Discharges incidental to the normal operation of recreational vessels__ 

        No permit shall be required under this chapter by the Administrator (or a State, in the case of a permit program approved under subsection (b)) for the discharge of any graywater, bilge water, cooling water, weather deck runoff, oil water separator effluent, or effluent from properly functioning marine engines, or any other discharge that is incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, if the discharge is from a recreational vessel.
