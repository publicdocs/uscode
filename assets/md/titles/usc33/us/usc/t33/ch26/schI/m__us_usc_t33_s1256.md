        for grants to States and to interstate agencies to assist them in administering programs for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution, including enforcement directly or through appropriate State law enforcement officers or agencies.

    (b) __Allotments__ 

        From the sums appropriated in any fiscal year, the Administrator shall make allotments to the several States and interstate agencies in accordance with regulations promulgated by him on the basis of the extent of the pollution problem in the respective States.

    (c) __Maximum annual payments__ 

    The Administrator is authorized to pay to each State and interstate agency each fiscal year either—

        (1) the allotment of such State or agency for such fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section, or

        which ever amount is the lesser.

    (d) __Limitations__ 

        No grant shall be made under this section to any State or interstate agency for any fiscal year when the expenditure of non-Federal funds by such State or interstate agency during such fiscal year for the recurrent expenses of carrying out its pollution control program are less than the expenditure by such State or interstate agency of non-Federal funds for such recurrent program expenses during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971.

    (e) __Grants prohibited to States not establishing water quality monitoring procedures or adequate emergency and contingency plans__ 

    Beginning in fiscal year 1974 the Administrator shall not make any grant under this section to any State which has not provided or is not carrying out as a part of its program—

        (1) the establishment and operation of appropriate devices, methods, systems, and procedures necessary to monitor, and to compile and analyze data on (including classification according to eutrophic condition), the quality of navigable waters and to the extent practicable, ground waters including biological monitoring; and provision for annually updating such data and including it in the report required under [section 1315 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1315];
