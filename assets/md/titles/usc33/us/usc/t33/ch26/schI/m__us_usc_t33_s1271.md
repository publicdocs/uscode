    (a) __Survey__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Secretary, shall conduct a comprehensive national survey of data regarding aquatic sediment quality in the United States. The Administrator shall compile all existing information on the quantity, chemical and physical composition, and geographic location of pollutants in aquatic sediment, including the probable source of such pollutants and identification of those sediments which are contaminated pursuant to section 501(b)(4). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (2) __Report__ 

            Not later than 24 months after October 31, 1992, the Administrator shall report to the Congress the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of such survey, including recommendations for actions necessary to prevent contamination of aquatic sediments and to control sources of contamination.

    (b) __Monitoring__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Secretary, shall conduct a comprehensive and continuing program to assess aquatic sediment quality. The program conducted pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum—

            (A) identify the location of pollutants in aquatic sediment;

            (B) identify the extent of pollutants in sediment and those sediments which are contaminated pursuant to section 501(b)(4); 1

            (C) establish methods and protocols for monitoring the physical, chemical, and biological effects of pollutants in aquatic sediment and of contaminated sediment;

            (D) develop a system for the management, storage, and dissemination of data concerning aquatic sediment quality;

            (E) provide an assessment of aquatic sediment quality trends over time;

            (F) identify locations where pollutants in sediment may pose a threat to the quality of drinking water supplies, fisheries resources, and marine habitats; and

            (G) establish a clearing house for information on technology, methods, and practices available for the remediation, decontamination, and control of sediment contamination.

        (2) __Report__ 

            The Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the monitoring under paragraph (1) on the date that is 2 years after the date specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section and biennially thereafter.
