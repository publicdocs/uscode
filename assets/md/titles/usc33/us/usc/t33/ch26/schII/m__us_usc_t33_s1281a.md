## § 1281a. Total treatment system funding

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case where the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds that the total of all grants made under [section 1281 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1281] for the same treatment works exceeds the actual construction costs for such treatment works (as defined in this chapter) such excess amount shall be a grant of the Federal share (as defined in this chapter) of the cost of construction of a sewage collection system if—

    (1) such sewage collection system was constructed as part of the same total treatment system as the treatment works for which such grants under [section 1281 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1281] were approved, and

    (2) an application for assistance for the construction of such sewage collection system was filed in accordance with [section 3102 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s3102] before all such grants under [section 1281 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1281] were made and such grant under [section 3102 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s3102] could not be approved due to lack of funding under such [section 3102 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s3102].

        The total of all grants for sewage collection systems made under this section shall not exceed $2,800,000.
