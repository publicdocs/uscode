## § 1286. Reimbursement and advanced construction

    (a) __Publicly owned treatment works construction initiated after__  __June 30, 1966__  __, but before__  __July 1, 1973__  __; reimbursement formula__ 

        Any publicly owned treatment works in a State on which construction was initiated after June 30, 1966, but before July 1, 1973, which was approved by the appropriate State water pollution control agency and which the Administrator finds meets the requirements of [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1158] in effect at the time of the initiation of construction shall be reimbursed a total amount equal to the difference between the amount of Federal financial assistance, if any, received under such [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1158] for such project and 50 per centum of the cost of such project, or 55 per centum of the project cost where the Administrator also determines that such treatment works was constructed in conformity with a comprehensive metropolitan treatment plan as described in [section 1158(f) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1158/f] as in effect immediately prior to October 18, 1972. Nothing in this subsection shall result in any such works receiving Federal grants from all sources in excess of 80 per centum of the cost of such project.

    (b) __Publicly owned treatment works construction initiated between__  __June 30, 1956__  __, and__  __June 30, 1966__  __; reimbursement formula__ 

        Any publicly owned treatment works constructed with or eligible for Federal financial assistance under this Act in a State between June 30, 1956, and June 30, 1966, which was approved by the State water pollution control agency and which the Administrator finds meets the requirements of [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1158] prior to October 18, 1972 but which was constructed without assistance under such [section 1158 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1158] or which received such assistance in an amount less than 30 per centum of the cost of such project shall qualify for payments and reimbursement of State or local funds used for such project from sums allocated to such State under this section in an amount which shall not exceed the difference between the amount of such assistance, if any, received for such project and 30 per centum of the cost of such project.

    (c) __Application for reimbursement__ 

        No publicly owned treatment works shall receive any payment or reimbursement under subsection (a) or (b) of this section unless an application for such assistance is filed with the Administrator within the one year period which begins on October 18, 1972. Any application filed within such one year period may be revised from time to time, as may be necessary.

    (d) __Allocation of funds__ 

        The Administrator shall allocate to each qualified project under subsection (a) of this section each fiscal year for which funds are appropriated under subsection (e) of this section an amount which bears the same ratio to the unpaid balance of the reimbursement due such project as the total of such funds for such year bears to the total unpaid balance of reimbursement due all such approved projects on the date of enactment of such appropriation. The Administrator shall allocate to each qualified project under subsection (b) of this section each fiscal year for which funds are appropriated under subsection (e) of this section an amount which bears the same ratio to the unpaid balance of the reimbursement due such project as the total of such funds for such year bears to the total unpaid balance of reimbursement due all such approved projects on the date of enactment of such appropriation.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out subsection (a) of this section not to exceed $2,600,000,000 and, to carry out subsection (b) of this section, not to exceed $750,000,000. The authorizations contained in this subsection shall be the sole source of funds for reimbursements authorized by this section.

    (f) __Additional funds__ 

        (1)

         In any case where a substantial portion of the funds allotted to a State for the current fiscal year under this subchapter have been obligated under [section 1281(g) of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1281/g], or will be so obligated in a timely manner (as determined by the Administrator), and there is construction of any treatment works project without the aid of Federal funds and in accordance with all procedures and all requirements applicable to treatment works projects, except those procedures and requirements which limit construction of projects to those constructed with the aid of previously allotted Federal funds, the Administrator, upon his approval of an application made under this subsection therefor, is authorized to pay the Federal share of the cost of construction of such project when additional funds are allotted to the State under this subchapter if prior to the construction of the project the Administrator approves plans, specifications, and estimates therefor in the same manner as other treatment works projects. The Administrator may not approve an application under this subsection unless an authorization is in effect for the first fiscal year in the period for which the application requests payment and such requested payment for that fiscal year does not exceed the State’s expected allotment from such authorization. The Administrator shall not be required to make such requested payment for any fiscal year—

            (A) to the extent that such payment would exceed such State’s allotment of the amount appropriated for such fiscal year; and

            (B) unless such payment is for a project which, on the basis of an approved funding priority list of such State, is eligible to receive such payment based on the allotment and appropriation for such fiscal year.

            To the extent that sufficient funds are not appropriated to pay the full Federal share with respect to a project for which obligations under the provisions of this subsection have been made, the Administrator shall reduce the Federal share to such amount less than 75 per centum as such appropriations do provide.

        (2) In determining the allotment for any fiscal year under this subchapter, any treatment works project constructed in accordance with this section and without the aid of Federal funds shall not be considered completed until an application under the provisions of this subsection with respect to such project has been approved by the Administrator, or the availability of funds from which this project is eligible for reimbursement has expired, whichever first occurs.

> “Funds available for reimbursement under [Public Law 92–399][/us/pl/92/399] \[making appropriations for Agriculture-Environmental and Consumer Protection Programs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973\] shall be allocated in accordance with subsection (d) of section 206 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ([86 Stat. 838][/us/stat/86/838]) \[subsec.
