## § 1330. National estuary program

    (a) __Management conference__ 

        (1) __Nomination of estuaries__ 

            The Governor of any State may nominate to the Administrator an estuary lying in whole or in part within the State as an estuary of national significance and request a management conference to develop a comprehensive management plan for the estuary. The nomination shall document the need for the conference, the likelihood of success, and information relating to the factors in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Convening of conference__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In any case where the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon nomination of a State under paragraph (1), that the attainment or maintenance of that water quality in an estuary which assures protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife, and allows recreational activities, in and on the water, requires the control of point and nonpoint sources of pollution to supplement existing controls of pollution in more than one State, the Administrator shall select such estuary and convene a management conference.

            (B) __Priority consideration__ 

                The Administrator shall give priority consideration under this section to Long Island Sound, New York and Connecticut; Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island; Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts; Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts (including Cape Cod Bay and Boston Harbor); Puget Sound, Washington; New York-New Jersey Harbor, New York and New Jersey; Delaware Bay, Delaware and New Jersey; Delaware Inland Bays, Delaware; Albemarle Sound, North Carolina; Sarasota Bay, Florida; San Francisco Bay, California; Santa Monica Bay, California; Galveston Bay, Texas; Barataria-Terrebonne Bay estuary complex, Louisiana; Indian River Lagoon, Florida; Lake Pontchartrain Basin, Louisiana and Mississippi; and Peconic Bay, New York.

        (3) __Boundary dispute exception__ 

            In any case in which a boundary between two States passes through an estuary and such boundary is disputed and is the subject of an action in any court, the Administrator shall not convene a management conference with respect to such estuary before a final adjudication has been made of such dispute.

    (b) __Purposes of conference__ 

    The purposes of any management conference convened with respect to an estuary under this subsection shall be to—

        (1) assess trends in water quality, natural resources, and uses of the estuary;

        (2) collect, characterize, and assess data on toxics, nutrients, and natural resources within the estuarine zone to identify the causes of environmental problems;

        (3) develop the relationship between the inplace loads and point and nonpoint loadings of pollutants to the estuarine zone and the potential uses of the zone, water quality, and natural resources;

        (4) develop a comprehensive conservation and management plan that recommends priority corrective actions and compliance schedules addressing point and nonpoint sources of pollution to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the estuary, including restoration and maintenance of water quality, a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife, and recreational activities in the estuary, and assure that the designated uses of the estuary are protected;

        (5) develop plans for the coordinated implementation of the plan by the States as well as Federal and local agencies participating in the conference;

        (6) monitor the effectiveness of actions taken pursuant to the plan; and

        (7) review all Federal financial assistance programs and Federal development projects in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12372, as in effect on September 17, 1983, to determine whether such assistance program or project would be consistent with and further the purposes and objectives of the plan prepared under this section.

        For purposes of paragraph (7), such programs and projects shall not be limited to the assistance programs and development projects subject to Executive Order 12372, but may include any programs listed in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance which may have an effect on the purposes and objectives of the plan developed under this section.

    (c) __Members of conference__ 

    The members of a management conference convened under this section shall include, at a minimum, the Administrator and representatives of—

        (1) each State and foreign nation located in whole or in part in the estuarine zone of the estuary for which the conference is convened;

        (2) international, interstate, or regional agencies or entities having jurisdiction over all or a significant part of the estuary;

        (3) each interested Federal agency, as determined appropriate by the Administrator;

        (4) local governments having jurisdiction over any land or water within the estuarine zone, as determined appropriate by the Administrator; and

        (5) affected industries, public and private educational institutions, and the general public, as determined appropriate by the Administrator.

    (d) __Utilization of existing data__ 

        In developing a conservation and management plan under this section, the management conference shall survey and utilize existing reports, data, and studies relating to the estuary that have been developed by or made available to Federal, interstate, State, and local agencies.

    (e) __Period of conference__ 

        A management conference convened under this section shall be convened for a period not to exceed 5 years. Such conference may be extended by the Administrator, and if terminated after the initial period, may be reconvened by the Administrator at any time thereafter, as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this section.

    (f) __Approval and implementation of plans__ 

        (1) __Approval__ 

            Not later than 120 days after the completion of a conservation and management plan and after providing for public review and comment, the Administrator shall approve such plan if the plan meets the requirements of this section and the affected Governor or Governors concur.

        (2) __Implementation__ 

            Upon approval of a conservation and management plan under this section, such plan shall be implemented. Funds authorized to be appropriated under subchapters II and VI of this chapter and [section 1329 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1329] may be used in accordance with the applicable requirements of this chapter to assist States with the implementation of such plan.

    (g) __Grants__ 

        (1) __Recipients__ 

            The Administrator is authorized to make grants to State, interstate, and regional water pollution control agencies and entities, State coastal zone management agencies, interstate agencies, other public or nonprofit private agencies, institutions, organizations, and individuals.
