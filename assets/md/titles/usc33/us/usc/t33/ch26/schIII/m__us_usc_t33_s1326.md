## § 1326. Thermal discharges

    (a) __Effluent limitations that will assure protection and propagation of balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife__ 

        With respect to any point source otherwise subject to the provisions of [section 1311 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311] or [section 1316 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1316], whenever the owner or operator of any such source, after opportunity for public hearing, can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator (or, if appropriate, the State) that any effluent limitation proposed for the control of the thermal component of any discharge from such source will require effluent limitations more stringent than necessary to assure the projection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife in and on the body of water into which the discharge is to be made, the Administrator (or, if appropriate, the State) may impose an effluent limitation under such sections for such plant, with respect to the thermal component of such discharge (taking into account the interaction of such thermal component with other pollutants), that will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife in and on that body of water.

    (b) __Cooling water intake structures__ 

        Any standard established pursuant to [section 1311 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311] or [section 1316 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1316] and applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.

    (c) __Period of protection from more stringent effluent limitations following discharge point source modification commenced after__  __October 18, 1972__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any point source of a discharge having a thermal component, the modification of which point source is commenced after October 18, 1972, and which, as modified, meets effluent limitations established under [section 1311 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1311] or, if more stringent, effluent limitations established under [section 1313 of this title][/us/usc/t33/s1313] and which effluent limitations will assure protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife in or on the water into which the discharge is made, shall not be subject to any more stringent effluent limitation with respect to the thermal component of its discharge during a ten year period beginning on the date of completion of such modification or during the period of depreciation or amortization of such facility for the purpose of section 167 or 169 (or both) of title 26, whichever period ends first.

([June 30, 1948, ch. 758][/us/act/1948-06-30/ch758], title III, § 316, as added [Pub. L. 92–500][/us/pl/92/500], § 2, Oct. 18, 1972, [86 Stat. 876][/us/stat/86/876]; amended [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514], § 2, Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
