Such section 324 did not contain a subsec. (b).

    The Fair Housing Act, referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(M), is title VIII of [Pub.

For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 6101 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6101] and Tables.

    This title, referred to in subsec. (d)(6), means title IV of [Pub. L. 101–625][/us/pl/101/625], known as the Homeownership and Opportunity Through HOPE Act, and probably should have been “this subtitle”, meaning subtitle B (§§ 421–431) of title IV of [Pub. L. 101–625][/us/pl/101/625], which is classified principally to this part. For complete classification of title IV of [Pub.
