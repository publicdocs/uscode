## § 12857. Authorization of appropriations

    There are authorized to be appropriated for assistance payments under this subchapter $520,665,600 for fiscal year 1993 and $542,533,555 for fiscal year 1994, of which such sums as may be necessary shall be available in each such fiscal year for use under [section 12852(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12852/e]. Any amount appropriated under this section shall be deposited in the Fund and shall remain available until expended, subject to the provisions of section 12858  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

([Pub. L. 101–625, title III][/us/pl/101/625/tIII], § 308, Nov. 28, 1990, [104 Stat. 4133][/us/stat/104/4133]; [Pub. L. 102–550, title I][/us/pl/102/550/tI], § 182(b), Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 3736][/us/stat/106/3736].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 12858 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12858], referred to in text, was in the original “section 311”, and was translated as reading “section 309”, meaning [section 309 of Pub. L. 101–625][/us/pl/101/625/s309], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 101–625][/us/pl/101/625] does not contain a section 311.

 __Amendments__ 

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subchapter $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1991 and $521,500,000 for fiscal year 1992. Any amount appropriated under this section shall be deposited in the Fund and remain available until expended, subject to the provisions of [section 12858 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12858].”
