                (i) not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation in accordance with local or other applicable regulations; or

                (ii) not in compliance with State, local, or model building codes, or other applicable codes, and cannot be brought into compliance with such codes for less than the cost of constructing a permanent structure.

        (2) __Maximum income of homebuyer__ 

        The aggregate annual income of the homebuyer and the members of the family of the homebuyer residing with the homebuyer, for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application of the homebuyer for assistance under this subchapter, does not exceed—

            (A) 95 percent of the median income for a family of 4 persons (adjusted by family size) in the applicable metropolitan statistical area (or such other area that the Board of Directors determines for areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas); or

            (B) 115 percent of such median income (adjusted by family size) in the case of an area that is subject to a high cost area mortgage limit under title II of the National Housing Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1707][/us/usc/t12/s1707] et seq.\].

            The Board of Directors shall provide for certification of such income for purposes of initial eligibility for assistance payments under this subchapter and shall provide for recertification of homebuyers (and families of homebuyers) so assisted not less than every 2 years thereafter.

        (3) __Certification__ 

            The homebuyer (and spouse, where applicable) shall certify that the homebuyer has made a good faith effort to obtain a market rate mortgage and has been denied because the annual income of the homebuyer and the members of the family of the homebuyer residing with the homebuyer is insufficient.

        (4) __Principal residence__ 

            The property securing the mortgage is a single-family residence or unit in a cooperative and is the principal residence of the homebuyer.

        (5) __Maximum mortgage amount__ 

            The principal obligation of the mortgage does not exceed the principal amount that could be insured with respect to the property under the National Housing Act \[[12 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t12/s1701] et seq.\].

        (6) __Maximum interest rate__ 

            The interest payable on the mortgage is established at a fixed rate that does not exceed a maximum rate of interest established by the Trust taking into consideration prevailing interest rates on similar mortgages.

        (7) __Responsible mortgagee__ 

            The mortgage has been made to, and is held by, a mortgagee that is federally insured or that is otherwise approved by the Trust as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly.

        (8) __Minimum downpayment__ 

            For a first-time homebuyer to receive downpayment assistance under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the homebuyer shall have paid not less than 1 percent of the cost of acquisition of the property (excluding any mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured), as such cost is estimated by the Board of Directors.

    (c) __Terms of assistance__ 

        (1) __Security__ 

            Assistance payments under this subchapter shall be secured by a lien on the property involved. The lien shall be subordinate to all mortgages existing on the property on the date on which the first assistance payment is made.

        (2) __Repayment upon sale__ 

            Assistance payments under this subchapter shall be repayable from the net proceeds of the sale, without interest, upon the sale of the property for which the assistance payments are made. If the sale results in no net proceeds or the net proceeds are insufficient to repay the amount of the assistance payments in full, the Board of Directors shall release the lien to the extent that the debt secured by the lien remains unpaid.

        (3) __Repayment upon increased income__ 

            If the aggregate annual income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer) assisted under this subchapter exceeds the applicable maximum income allowable under subsection (b)(2) of this section for any 2-year period after such assistance is provided, the Board of Directors may provide for the repayment, on a monthly basis, of all or a portion of such assistance payments, based on the amount of assistance provided and the income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer).

        (4) __Repayment if property ceases to be principal residence__ 

            If the property for which assistance payments are made ceases to be the principal residence of the first-time homebuyer (or the family of the homebuyer), the Board of Directors may provide for the repayment of all or a portion of the assistance payments.

        (5) __Available assistance__ 

            The Trust may make assistance payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section with respect to a single mortgage of an eligible homebuyer.

    (d) __Allocation formula__ 

        Amounts available in any fiscal year for assistance under this subchapter shall be allocated for homebuyers in each State on the basis of the need of eligible first-time homebuyers in each State for such assistance in comparison with the need of eligible first-time homebuyers for such assistance among all States.

    (e) __Assistance in connection with housing financed with mortgage revenue bonds__ 

        (1) __Authority__ 

            The Trust shall provide assistance for first-time homebuyers in the form of interest rate buydowns and downpayment assistance under this subsection. Such assistance shall be available only with respect to mortgages for the purchase of residences (A) financed with the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond (as such term is defined in [section 143 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s143]), or (B) for which a credit is allowable under [section 25 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s25].

                (iii) in the third year of the mortgage, 1.0 percent of the total principal obligation of the mortgage; and
