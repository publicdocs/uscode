## § 12705a. Purposes of Removal of Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing Act

The purposes of sections 12705a to 12705d of this title are—

    (1) to encourage State and local governments to further identify and remove regulatory barriers to affordable housing (including barriers that are excessive, unnecessary, duplicative, or exclusionary) that significantly increase housing costs and limit the supply of affordable housing; and

    (2) to strengthen the connection between Federal housing assistance and State and local efforts to identify and eliminate regulatory barriers.
