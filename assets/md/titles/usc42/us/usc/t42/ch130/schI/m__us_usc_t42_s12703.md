## § 12703. Purposes of Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act

    The purposes of this Act are—

    (3) to extend and strengthen partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector, including for-profit and nonprofit organizations, in the production and operation of housing affordable to low-income and moderate-income families;

    (4) to expand and improve Federal rental assistance for very low-income families; and
