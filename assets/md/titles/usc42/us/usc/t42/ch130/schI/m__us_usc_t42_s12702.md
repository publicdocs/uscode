## § 12702. Objective of national housing policy

    The objective of national housing policy shall be to reaffirm the long-established national commitment to decent, safe, and sanitary housing for every American by strengthening a nationwide partnership of public and private institutions able—

    (1) to ensure that every resident of the United States has access to decent shelter or assistance in avoiding homelessness;

    (2) to increase the Nation’s supply of decent housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income families and accessible to job opportunities;

    (3) to improve housing opportunities for all residents of the United States, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities, on a nondiscriminatory basis;

    (4) to help make neighborhoods safe and livable;

    (5) to expand opportunities for homeownership;

    (6) to provide every American community with a reliable, readily available supply of mortgage finance at the lowest possible interest rates; and

    (7) to encourage tenant empowerment and reduce generational poverty in federally assisted and public housing by improving the means by which self-sufficiency may be achieved.
