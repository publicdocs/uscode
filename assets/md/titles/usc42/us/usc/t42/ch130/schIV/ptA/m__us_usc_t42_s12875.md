## § 12875. Other program requirements

    (a) __Preferences__ 

        In selecting eligible families for homeownership, the recipient shall give a first preference to otherwise qualified current tenants and a second preference to otherwise qualified eligible families who have completed participation in an economic self-sufficiency program specified by the Secretary.

    (b) __Cost limitations__ 

        The Secretary may establish cost limitations on eligible activities under this part, subject to the provisions of this part.

    (c) __Use of proceeds from sales to eligible families__ 

        The entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, shall use the proceeds, if any, from the initial sale for costs of the homeownership program, including operating expenses, improvements to the project, business opportunities for low-income families, supportive services related to the homeownership program, additional homeownership opportunities, and other activities approved by the Secretary.

    (d) __Restrictions on resale by homeowners__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Transfer permitted__ 

                A homeowner under a homeownership program may transfer the homeowner’s ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit, except that a homeownership program may establish restrictions on the resale of units under the program.

            (B) __Right to purchase__ 

                Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or cooperative has jurisdiction over the unit, the corporation, council, or cooperative shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit from the homeowner for the amount specified in a firm contract between the homeowner and a prospective buyer. If such an entity does not have jurisdiction over the unit or elects not to purchase and if the prospective buyer is not a low-income family, the public housing agency or the implementation grant recipient shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit for the same amount.

            (C) __Promissory note required__ 

                The homeowner shall execute a promissory note equal to the difference between the market value and the purchase price, payable to the public housing agency or other entity designated in the homeownership plan, together with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note.

        (2) __6 years or less__ 

        In the case of a transfer within 6 years of the acquisition under the program, the homeownership program shall provide for appropriate restrictions to assure that an eligible family may not receive any undue profit. The plan shall provide for limiting the family’s consideration for its interest in the property to the total of—

            (A) the contribution to equity paid by the family;

            (B) the value, as determined by such means as the Secretary shall determine through regulation, of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family’s tenure as owner; and

            (C) the appreciated value determined by an inflation allowance at a rate which may be based on a cost-of-living index, an income index, or market index as determined by the Secretary through regulation and agreed to by the purchaser and the entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families (or another entity specified in the approved application), at the time of initial sale, and applied against the contribution to equity.

            Such an entity may, at the time of initial sale, enter into an agreement with the family to set a maximum amount which this appreciation may not exceed.

        (3) __6–20 years__ 

            In the case of a transfer during the period beginning 6 years after the acquisition and ending 20 years after the acquisition, the homeownership program shall provide for the recapture by the Secretary or the program of an amount equal to the amount of the declining balance on the note described in paragraph (1)(C).

        (4) __Use of recaptured funds__ 

            Fifty percent of any portion of the net sales proceeds that may not be retained by the homeowner under the plan approved pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the entity that transferred ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, for use for improvements to the project, business opportunities for low-income families, supportive services related to the homeownership program, additional homeownership opportunities, and other activities approved by the Secretary. The remaining 50 percent shall be returned to the Secretary for use under this part, subject to limitations contained in appropriations Acts. Such entity shall keep and make available to the Secretary all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Secretary under this subsection.

    (e) __Third party rights__ 

        The requirements under this part regarding quality standards, resale, or transfer of the ownership interest of a homeowner shall be judicially enforceable against the grant recipient with respect to actions involving rehabilitation, and against purchasers of property under this subsection or their successors in interest with respect to other actions by affected low-income families, resident management corporations, resident councils, public housing agencies, and any agency, corporation, or authority of the United States Government. The parties specified in the preceding sentence shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees upon prevailing in any such judicial action.

    (f) __Dollar limitation on economic development activities__ 

        Not more than an aggregate of $250,000 from amounts made available under sections 12872 and 12873 of this title may be used for economic development activities under sections 12872(b)(6) and 12873(b)(9)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title for any project.

    (g) __Timely homeownership__ 

        Recipients shall transfer ownership of the property to tenants within a specified period of time that the Secretary determines to be reasonable. During the interim period when the property continues to be operated and managed as rental housing, the recipient shall utilize written tenant selection policies and criteria that are approved by the Secretary as consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for low-income families. The recipient shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.

    (h) __Records and audit of recipients of assistance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each recipient shall keep such records as may be reasonably necessary to fully disclose the amount and the disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of assistance received under this part (and any proceeds from financing obtained or sales under subsections (c) and (d) of this section), the total cost of the homeownership program in connection with which such assistance is given or used, and the amount and nature of that portion of the program supplied by other sources, and such other sources as will facilitate an effective audit.

        (2) __Access by Secretary__ 

            The Secretary shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this part.

        (3) __Access by Comptroller General__ 

            The Comptroller General of the United States, or any of the duly authorized representatives of the Comptroller General, shall also have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this part.

    (i) __Certain entities not eligible__ 

        Any entity that assumes, as determined by the Secretary, a mortgage covering eligible property in connection with the acquisition of the property from an owner under this section must comply with any low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining term of the mortgage. This requirement shall only apply to an entity, such as a cooperative association, that, as determined by the Secretary, intends to own the housing on a permanent basis.
