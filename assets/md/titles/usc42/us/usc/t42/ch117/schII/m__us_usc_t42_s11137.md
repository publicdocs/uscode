    (b) __Confidentiality of information__ 

        (1) __In general__

Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the disclosure of such information by a party which is otherwise authorized, under applicable State law, to make such disclosure. Information reported under this subchapter that is in a form that does not permit the identification of any particular health care entity, physician, other health care practitioner, or patient shall not be considered confidential. The Secretary (or the agency designated under [section 11134(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11134/b]), on application by any person, shall prepare such information in such form and shall disclose such information in such form.

        (2) __Penalty for violations__ 

            Any person who violates paragraph (1) shall be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $10,000 for each such violation involved. Such penalty shall be imposed and collected in the same manner as civil money penalties under subsection (a) of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] are imposed and collected under that section.

        (3) __Use of information__

        (4) __Fees__ 

            The Secretary may establish or approve reasonable fees for the disclosure of information under this section or [section 11136 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11136]. The amount of such a fee may not exceed the costs of processing the requests for disclosure and of providing such information. Such fees shall be available to the Secretary (or, in the Secretary’s discretion, to the agency designated under [section 11134(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11134/b]) to cover such costs.

    (c) __Relief from liability for reporting__ 

        No person or entity (including the agency designated under [section 11134(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11134/b]) shall be held liable in any civil action with respect to any report made under this subchapter (including information provided under subsection (a) of this section  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis. </sup></sup>  without knowledge of the falsity of the information contained in the report.
