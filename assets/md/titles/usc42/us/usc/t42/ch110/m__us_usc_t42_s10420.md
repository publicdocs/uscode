 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 and also as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, and not as part of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act which comprises this chapter.

    Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 109–271, § 7(d)(2)(B)][/us/pl/109/271/s7/d/2/B], added subsec. (f) and struck out former subsec. (f) which read as follows: “Not less than 10 percent of the total amount available under this section for each fiscal year shall be available for grants under the program authorized in [section 3796gg–10 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3796gg–10]. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to funds allocated for such program.”
