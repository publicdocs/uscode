        (2)

         The Administrator shall develop and make effective for use during the second full calendar year following August 4, 1977, the format for an energy-producing company financial report. Such report shall be designed to allow comparison on a uniform and standardized basis among energy-producing companies and shall permit for the energy-related activities of such companies—

            (A) an evaluation of company revenues, profits, cash flow, and investments in total, for the energy-related lines of commerce in which such company is engaged and for all significant energy-related functions within such company;

            (B) an analysis of the competitive structure of sectors and functional groupings within the energy industry;

            (C) the segregation of energy information, including financial information, describing company operations by energy source and geographic area;

            (D) the determination of costs associated with exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, and marketing and other significant energy-related functions within such company; and

            (E) such other analyses or evaluations as the Administrator finds is necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.

        (3) The Administrator shall consult with the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the development of accounting practices required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6201][/us/usc/t42/s6201] et seq.\] to be followed by persons engaged in whole or in part in the production of crude oil and natural gas and shall endeavor to assure that the energy-producing company financial report described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, to the extent practicable and consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter, is consistent with such accounting practices where applicable.

        (4) The Administrator shall require each major energy-producing company to file with the Administrator an energy-producing company financial report on at least an annual basis and may request energy information described in such report on a quarterly basis if he determines that such quarterly report of information will substantially assist in achieving the purposes of this chapter.

        (5) A summary of information gathered pursuant to this section, accompanied by such analysis as the Administrator deems appropriate, shall be included in the annual report of the Department required by subsection (a)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. [Section 7267 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7267] was enacted without a subsec. (a). </sup></sup>  of [section 7267 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7267].
