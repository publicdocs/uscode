    (b) The Department may pay, to the extent authorized for certain other Federal employees by [section 5723 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5723], travel expenses for any individual appointed for a limited term or on a temporary basis and transportation expenses of his or her immediate family and his or her household goods and personal effects from that individual’s residence at the time of selection or assignment to his or her duty station.
