        (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Energy may transfer, for consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the property referred to in subsection (b) of this section to any person if the Secretary determines that such transfer will mitigate the adverse economic consequences that might otherwise arise from the closure of a Department of Energy facility.

        (3) The Secretary may require any additional terms and conditions with respect to a transfer of property under paragraph (1) that the Secretary determines appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.

    (b) __Covered property__
