>         If the Commission determines pursuant to a proceeding instituted as a result of a complaint under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act that the rate is not just and reasonable, the rate shall not be deemed to be just and reasonable. Any tariff reduction or refunds that may result as an outcome of such a complaint shall be prospective from the date of the filing of the complaint.

>     “(c) __Limitation Regarding Unduly Discriminatory or Preferential Tariffs.—__ 

>     Nothing in this section shall prohibit any aggrieved person from filing a complaint under section 13 or section 15(l) of the Interstate Commerce Act \[former [49 U.S.C. 13][/us/usc/t49/s13], 15(1)\] challenging any tariff provision as unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential.
