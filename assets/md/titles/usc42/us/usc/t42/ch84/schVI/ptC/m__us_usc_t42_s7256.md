## § 7256. Contracts, leases, etc., with public agencies and private organizations and persons

    (a) __General authority__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to enter into and perform such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other similar transactions with public agencies and private organizations and persons, and to make such payments (in lump sum or installments, and by way of advance or reimbursement) as he may deem to be necessary or appropriate to carry out functions now or hereafter vested in the Secretary.

    (b) __Limitation on authority; appropriations__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no authority to enter into contracts or to make payments under this subchapter shall be effective except to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

    (c) __Leasing of excess Department of Energy property__ 

    The Secretary may lease, upon terms and conditions the Secretary considers appropriate to promote national security or the public interest, acquired real property and related personal property that—

        (1) is located at a facility of the Department of Energy to be closed or reconfigured;

        (2) at the time the lease is entered into, is not needed by the Department of Energy; and

        (3) is under the control of the Department of Energy.

    (d) __Terms of lease__ 

        (1) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may not be for a term of more than 10 years, except that the Secretary may enter into a lease that includes an option to renew for a term of more than 10 years if the Secretary determines that entering into such a lease will promote the national security or be in the public interest.

        (2) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is less than the fair market rental value of the leasehold interest. Services relating to the protection and maintenance of the leased property may constitute all or part of such consideration.

    (e) __Environmental concerns__ 

        (1) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (with respect to property located on a site on the National Priorities List) or the appropriate State official (with respect to property located on a site that is not listed on the National Priorities List) to determine whether the environmental conditions of the property are such that leasing the property, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, are consistent with safety and the protection of public health and the environment.

        (2) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the appropriate State official, as the case may be, in the determination required under paragraph (1). The Secretary may enter into a lease under subsection (c) of this section without obtaining such concurrence if, within 60 days after the Secretary requests the concurrence, the Administrator or appropriate State official, as the case may be, fails to submit to the Secretary a notice of such individual’s concurrence with, or rejection of, the determination.

    (f) __Retention and use of rentals; report__ 

        To the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may retain and use money rentals received by the Secretary directly from a lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section in any amount the Secretary considers necessary to cover the administrative expenses of the lease, the maintenance and repair of the leased property, or environmental restoration activities at the facility where the leased property is located. Amounts retained under this subsection shall be retained in a separate fund established in the Treasury for such purpose. The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report on amounts retained and amounts used under this subsection.

    (g) __Additional authorities__ 

        (1) In addition to authority granted to the Secretary under any other provision of law, the Secretary may exercise the same authority to enter into transactions (other than contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants), subject to the same terms and conditions as the Secretary of Defense under [section 2371 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2371] (other than subsections (b) and (f) of that section).

        (2)

         In applying [section 2371 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2371] to the Secretary under paragraph (1)—

            (A) the term “basic” shall be replaced by the term “research”;

            (B) the term “applied” shall be replaced by the term “development”; and

            (C) the terms “advanced research projects” and “advanced research” shall be replaced by the term “demonstration projects”.

        (3)

         The authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall not be subject to—

            (A) [section 5908 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5908]; or

            (B) [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2182].

        (4)

            (A) The Secretary shall use such competitive, merit-based selection procedures in entering into transactions under paragraph (1), as the Secretary determines in writing to be practicable.

            (B) A transaction under paragraph (1) shall relate to a research, development, or demonstration project only if the Secretary determines in writing that the use of a standard contract, grant, or cooperative agreement for the project is not feasible or appropriate.

        (5) The Secretary may protect from disclosure, for up to 5 years after the date on which the information is developed, any information developed pursuant to a transaction under paragraph (1) that would be protected from disclosure under [section 552(b)(4) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b/4], if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency.

        (6)

            (A) Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue guidelines for transactions under paragraph (1).

            (B) The guidelines shall be published in the Federal Register for public comment in accordance with rulemaking procedures of the Department.

            (C) The Secretary shall not have authority to carry out transactions under paragraph (1) until the guidelines for transactions required under subparagraph (A) are final.

        (7) The annual report of the head of an executive agency under section 2371(h)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 10 shall be submitted to Congress.

        (8)

            (A) In this paragraph, the term “nontraditional Government contractor” has the meaning given the term “nontraditional defense contractor” in section 845(f) 1 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 ([Public Law 103–160][/us/pl/103/160]; [10 U.S.C. 2371][/us/usc/t10/s2371] note).

            (B)

             Not later than 1 year after the date on which the final guidelines are published under paragraph (6), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report describing—

                (i) the use by the Department of authorities under this section, including the ability to attract nontraditional Government contractors; and

                (ii) whether additional safeguards are necessary to carry out the authorities.

        (9) The authority of the Secretary under this subsection may be delegated only to an officer of the Department who is appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

        (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority to enter into transactions under paragraph (1) shall terminate on September 30, 2020.
