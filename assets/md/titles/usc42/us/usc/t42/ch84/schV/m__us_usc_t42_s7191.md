## § 7191. Procedures for issuance of rules, regulations, or orders

    (a) __Applicability of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5__ 

        (1) Subject to the other requirements of this subchapter, the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 shall apply in accordance with its terms to any rule or regulation, or any order having the applicability and effect of a rule (as defined in [section 551(4) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s551/4]), issued pursuant to authority vested by law in, or transferred or delegated to, the Secretary, or required by this chapter or any other Act to be carried out by any other officer, employee, or component of the Department, other than the Commission, including any such rule, regulation, or order of a State, or local government agency or officer thereof, issued pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter. If any provision of any Act, the functions of which are transferred, vested, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, provides administrative procedure requirements in addition to the requirements provided in this subchapter, such additional requirements shall also apply to actions under that provision.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this subchapter shall apply to the Commission to the same extent this subchapter applies to the Secretary in the exercise of any of the Commission’s functions under [section 7172(c)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7172/c/1] or which the Secretary has assigned under [section 7172(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7172/e].

    (b) __Substantial issue of fact or law or likelihood of substantial impact on Nation’s economy, etc.; oral presentation__ 

        (1) If the Secretary determines, on his own initiative or in response to any showing made pursuant to paragraph (2) (with respect to a proposed rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section) that no substantial issue of fact or law exists and that such rule, regulation, or order is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the Nation’s economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, such proposed rule, regulation, or order may be promulgated in accordance with [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553]. If the Secretary determines that a substantial issue of fact or law exists or that such rule, regulation, or order is likely to have a substantial impact on the Nation’s economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments shall be provided.

        (2) Any person, who would be adversely affected by the implementation of any proposed rule, regulation, or order who desires an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, may submit material supporting the existence of such substantial issues or such impact.

        (3) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation with respect to a rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Waiver of requirements__ 

        The requirements of subsection (b) of this section may be waived where strict compliance is found by the Secretary to be likely to cause serious harm or injury to the public health, safety, or welfare, and such finding is set out in detail in such rule, regulation, or order. In the event the requirements of this section are waived, the requirements shall be satisfied within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the promulgation of such rule, regulation, or order.

    (d) __Effects confined to single unit of local government, geographic area within State, or State; hearing or oral presentation__ 

        (1)

         With respect to any rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section, the effects of which, except for indirect effects of an inconsequential nature, are confined to—

            (A) a single unit of local government or the residents thereof;

            (B) a single geographic area within a State or the residents thereof; or

            (C) a single State or the residents thereof;

            the Secretary shall, in any case where appropriate, afford an opportunity for a hearing or the oral presentation of views, and provide procedures for the holding of such hearing or oral presentation within the boundaries of the unit of local government, geographic area, or State described in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph as the case may be.

        (2)

         For the purposes of this subsection—

            (A) the term “unit of local government” means a county, municipality, town, township, village, or other unit of general government below the State level; and

            (B) the term “geographic area within a State” means a special purpose district or other region recognized for governmental purposes within such State which is not a unit of local government.

        (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a hearing or an oral presentation of views where none is required by this section or other provision of law.

    (e) __Prescription of procedures for State and local government agencies__ 

        Where authorized by any law vested, transferred, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary may, by rule, prescribe procedures for State or local government agencies authorized by the Secretary to carry out such functions as may be permitted under applicable law. Such procedures shall apply to such agencies in lieu of this section, and shall require that prior to taking any action, such agencies shall take steps reasonably calculated to provide notice to persons who may be affected by the action, and shall afford an opportunity for presentation of views (including oral presentation of views where practicable) within a reasonable time before taking the action.
