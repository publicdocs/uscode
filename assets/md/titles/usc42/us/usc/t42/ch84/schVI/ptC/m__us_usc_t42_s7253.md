 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 95–91][/us/pl/95/91], Aug. 4, 1977, [91 Stat. 565][/us/stat/91/565], known as the Department of Energy Organization Act, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 7101 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7101] and Tables.

    [Section 2402(e) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s2402/e], referred to in subsec. (c), probably means the subsec. (e) of [section 2402 of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s2402] which relates to reorganization authority and was added by [Pub. L. 106–398, § 1][/us/pl/106/398/s1] \[div. C, title XXXI, § 3159(a)\], Oct. 30, 2000, [114 Stat. 1654][/us/stat/114/1654], 1654A–469 and redesignated [section 2402(f) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s2402/f] by [Pub. L. 107–107, div. A, title X, § 1048(i)(12)][/us/pl/107/107/s1048/i/12], Dec. 28, 2001, [115 Stat. 1230][/us/stat/115/1230].

 __Amendments__ 

    2013—Subsecs. (b), (c). [Pub. L. 112–239][/us/pl/112/239] redesignated subsec. (b) relating to nonapplicability of authority of Secretary to National Nuclear Security Administration as (c).

    2000—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 106–398, § 1][/us/pl/106/398/s1] \[div. C, title XXXI, § 3159(b)(1)\], which directed amendment of section by substituting “(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary” for “The Secretary”, could not be executed because the words “The Secretary” did not appear after execution of the amendment by [Pub. L. 106–377, § 1(a)(2)][/us/pl/106/377/s1/a/2] \[title III, § 314(b)(1)\]. See below.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 106–398, § 1][/us/pl/106/398/s1] \[div. C, title XXXI, § 3159(b)(2)\], added subsec. (b) relating to nonapplicability of authority of Secretary under subsec. (a) of this section to National Nuclear Security Administration.
