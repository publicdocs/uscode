        (2) identify the foreign nations exporting the coal, the domestic electric utility plants receiving coal from each exporting nation, the domestically produced coal supplied to such plants, and the domestic coal production, by State, displaced by the imported coal;

        (3) identify (to the extent allowed under disclosure policy), at regional and State levels of aggregation, transportation modes and costs for delivery of imported coal from the exporting country port of origin to the point of consumption in the United States; and

        (4) specifically highlight and analyze any significant trends of unusual variations in coal imports.

>     “(b) __Contents.—__ 

>     The report required by this section shall—

>         “(1) contain a detailed analysis of potential domestic markets for foreign coals, by producing nation, between 1985 and 1995;

>         “(3) identify domestically produced coal that potentially could be replaced by imported coal;

>         “(4) identify contractual commitments of domestic utilities expiring between 1985 and 1995 and describe spot buying practices of domestic utilities, fuel cost patterns, plant modification costs required to burn foreign coals, proximity of navigable waters to utilities, demand for compliance coal, availability of less expensive purchased power from Canada, and State and local considerations;

>         “(5) evaluate increased coal consumption by domestic electric utilities resulting from increased power sales and analyze the potential coal import market represented by this increased coal consumption, including consumption by existing coal-fired plants, new coal-fired plants projected up to the year 1995, and plants planning to convert to coal by 1995;

>         “(6) identify existing authorities available to the Federal Government relating to coal imports, assess the potential impact of exercising each of these authorities, and describe executive branch plans and strategies to address coal imports;

>         “(9) identify specifically the participation of all United States corporations involved in mining and exporting coal from foreign nations; and

>         “(10) identify the policies governing coal imports of all coal-importing industrialized nations (including the United States, Japan, and European nations) by considering such factors as import duties or tariffs, import quotas, and other governmental restrictions or trade policies impacting coal imports.”
