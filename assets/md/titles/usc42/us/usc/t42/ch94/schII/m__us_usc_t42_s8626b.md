    (a) __Purpose__ 

    The purpose of the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge (in this section referred to as “R.E.A.Ch.”) program is to—

        (1) minimize health and safety risks that result from high energy burdens on low-income Americans;

        (2) prevent homelessness as a result of inability to pay energy bills;

States may use such grants for the costs of planning, implementing, and evaluating the initiative.

        (2) __Reservation__ 

        The Secretary shall reserve from any funds allocated under this subsection, funds to make additional payments to State R.E.A.Ch. programs that—

    (c) __Criteria__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than May 31, 1995, the Secretary shall establish criteria for approving State plans required by subsection (a) of this section, for energy efficiency education quality standards described in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, and for the distribution of funds to States with approved plans.

        (2) __Documentation__ 

            Notwithstanding the limitations of [section 8624(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8624/b] regarding the authority of the Secretary with respect to plans, the Secretary may require a State to provide appropriate documentation that its R.E.A.Ch. activities conform to the State plan as approved by the Secretary.
