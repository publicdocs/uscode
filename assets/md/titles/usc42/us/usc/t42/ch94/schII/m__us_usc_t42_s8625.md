        Whenever the Secretary determines that a State that has received a payment under this subchapter has failed to comply with subsection (a) of this section or an applicable regulation, he shall notify the chief executive officer of the State and shall request him to secure compliance. If within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, the chief executive officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, the Secretary is authorized to (1) refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted; (2) exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \[[42 U.S.C. 2000d][/us/usc/t42/s2000d] et seq.\], the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \[[42 U.S.C. 6101][/us/usc/t42/s6101] et seq.\], or [section 794 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s794], as may be applicable; or (3) take such other action as may be provided by law.

    (c) __Maintenance of civil actions__
