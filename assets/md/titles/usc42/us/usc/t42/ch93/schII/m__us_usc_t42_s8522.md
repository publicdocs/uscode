        For purposes of this section the term “odd-even fuel purchase plan” means any motor fuel sales restriction under which a person may purchase motor fuel for use in any vehicle only on days (or other periods of time) determined on the basis of a number or letter appearing on the license plate of that vehicle (or on any similar basis).
