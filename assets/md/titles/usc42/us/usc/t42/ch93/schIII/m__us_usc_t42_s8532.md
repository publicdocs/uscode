    (a) __Monitoring program__ 

        (1) Not later than 60 days after November 5, 1979, the Secretary shall establish and maintain a data collection program for monitoring, at the refining, wholesale, and retail levels, the supply and demand levels of middle distillates on a periodic basis in each State.

        (2)

         The program to be established under paragraph (1) shall provide for—

            (A) the prompt collection of relevant demand and supply data under the authority available to the Secretary under other law; and

            (B) the submission to Congress of periodic reports each containing a concise narrative analysis of the most recent data which the Secretary determines are accurate, and a discussion on a State-by-State basis of trends in such data which the Secretary determines are significant.

        (3) All data and information collected under this program shall be available to the Congress and committees of the Congress, and, in accordance with otherwise applicable law, to appropriate State and Federal agencies and the public.

        (4) Nothing in this subsection authorizes the direct or indirect regulation of the price of any middle distillate.
