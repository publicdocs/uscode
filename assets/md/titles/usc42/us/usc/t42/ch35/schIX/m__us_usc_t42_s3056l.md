            As part of the review described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may consider any information, including the applicant’s history with regard to the management of other grants.

        (3) __Failure to satisfy test__ 

            The failure to satisfy a responsibility test with respect to any 1 factor that is listed in paragraph (4), excluding those listed in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph, does not establish that the applicant is not responsible unless such failure is substantial or persists for 2 or more consecutive years.

        (5) __Determination__ 

            Applicants that are determined to be not responsible shall not be selected as grantees.

        (6) __Disallowed costs__ 

            Interest on disallowed costs shall accrue in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including the amendments made by that Act.

    (e) __Grantees serving individuals with barriers to employment__
