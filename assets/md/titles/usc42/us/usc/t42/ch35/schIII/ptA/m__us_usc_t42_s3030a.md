## § 3030a. Nutrition services incentive program

    (a) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this section is to provide incentives to encourage and reward effective performance by States and tribal organizations in the efficient delivery of nutritious meals to older individuals.

    (b) __Allotment and provision and payment__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall allot and provide, in accordance with this section, to or on behalf of each State agency with a plan approved under this subchapter for a fiscal year, and to or on behalf of each grantee with an application approved under subchapter X of this chapter for such fiscal year, an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount appropriated for such fiscal year under subsection (e) of this section as the number of meals served in the State under such plan approved for the preceding fiscal year (or the number of meals served by the title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee, under such application approved for such preceding fiscal year), bears to the total number of such meals served in all States and by all title VI \[subchapter X\] grantees under all such plans and applications approved for such preceding fiscal year.

        (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of a grantee that has an application approved under subchapter X of this chapter for a fiscal year but that did not receive assistance under this section for the preceding fiscal year, the number of meals served by the title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee for the preceding fiscal year shall be deemed to equal the number of meals that the Assistant Secretary estimates will be served by the title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee in the fiscal year for which the application was approved.

    (c) __Donation of products__ 

        (1) Agricultural commodities (including bonus commodities) and products purchased by the Secretary of Agriculture under [section 612c of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s612c], shall be donated to a recipient of a grant or contract to be used for providing nutrition services in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

        (2) The Commodity Credit Corporation shall dispose of food commodities (including bonus commodities) under [section 1431 of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1431] by donating them to a recipient of a grant or contract to be used for providing nutrition services in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

        (3) Dairy products (including bonus commodities) purchased by the Secretary of Agriculture under [section 1446a–1 of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1446a–1] shall be used to meet the requirements of programs providing nutrition services in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

        (4) Among the commodities provided under this subsection, the Secretary of Agriculture shall give special emphasis to foods of high nutritional value to support the health of older individuals. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary, is authorized to prescribe the terms and conditions respecting the provision of commodities under this subsection.

    (d) __Option to obtain commodities from Secretary of Agriculture__ 

        (1) Each State agency and each title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee shall be entitled to use all or any part of amounts allotted under subsection (b) to obtain, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), from the Secretary of Agriculture commodities available through any food program of the Department of Agriculture at the rates at which such commodities are valued for purposes of such program.

        (2) The Secretary of Agriculture shall determine and report to the Secretary, by such date as the Secretary may require, the amount (if any) of its allotment under subsection (b) which each State agency and title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee has elected to receive in the form of commodities. Such amount shall include an amount bearing the same ratio to the costs to the Secretary of Agriculture of providing such commodities under this subsection as the value of commodities received by such State agency or title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee under this subsection bears to the total value of commodities so received.

        (3) From the allotment under subsection (b) for each State agency and title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee, the Secretary shall transfer funds to the Secretary of Agriculture for the costs of commodities received by such State agency or grantee, and expenses related to the procurement of the commodities on behalf of such State agency or grantee, under this subsection, and shall then pay the balance (if any) to such State agency or grantee. The amount of funds transferred for the expenses related to the procurement of the commodities shall be mutually agreed on by the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture. The transfer of funds for the costs of the commodities and the related expenses shall occur in a timely manner after the Secretary of Agriculture submits the corresponding report described in paragraph (2), and shall be subject to the availability of appropriations. Amounts received by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to this section to make commodity purchases for a fiscal year for a State agency or title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee shall remain available, only for the next fiscal year, to make commodity purchases for that State agency or grantee pursuant to this section.

        (4) Each State agency and title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee shall promptly and equitably disburse amounts received under this subsection to recipients of grants and contracts. Such disbursements shall only be used by such recipients of grants or contracts to purchase domestically produced foods for their nutrition projects.

        (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any State agency or title VI \[subchapter X\] grantee to elect to receive cash payments under this subsection.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section (other than subsection (c)(1) of this section) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2007 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.

    (f) __Dissemination of information__ 

        In each fiscal year, the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly disseminate to State agencies, title VI \[subchapter X\] grantees, area agencies on aging, and providers of nutrition services assisted under this subchapter, information concerning the foods available to such State agencies, title VI \[subchapter X\] grantees, area agencies on aging, and providers under subsection (c).
