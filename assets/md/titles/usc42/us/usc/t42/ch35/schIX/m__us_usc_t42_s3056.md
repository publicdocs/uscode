## § 3056. Older American community service employment program

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Establishment of program__ 

            To foster individual economic self-sufficiency and promote useful opportunities in community service activities (which shall include community service employment) for unemployed low-income persons who are age 55 or older, particularly persons who have poor employment prospects, and to increase the number of persons who may enjoy the benefits of unsubsidized employment in both the public and private sectors, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in this subchapter as the “Secretary”) may establish an older American community service employment program.

        (2) __Use of appropriated amounts__ 

            Amounts appropriated to carry out this subchapter shall be used only to carry out the provisions contained in this subchapter.

    (b) __Grant authority__ 

        (1) __Projects__ 

        To carry out this subchapter, the Secretary may make grants to public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations, agencies of a State, and tribal organizations to carry out the program established under subsection (a). Such grants may provide for the payment of costs, as provided in subsection (c), of projects developed by such organizations and agencies in cooperation with the Secretary in order to make such program effective or to supplement such program. The Secretary shall make the grants from allotments made under [section 3056d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3056d], and in accordance with section 3056l of this title. No payment shall be made by the Secretary toward the cost of any project established or administered by such an organization or agency unless the Secretary determines that such project—

                (i) will provide community service employment and other authorized activities for eligible individuals in the community in which such individuals reside, or in nearby communities; or

            (J)

             will ensure that safe and healthy employment conditions will be provided, and will ensure that participants employed in community service and other jobs assisted under this subchapter will be paid wages that shall not be lower than whichever is the highest of—
