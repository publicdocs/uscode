    (c) __Division between national grants and grants to States__ 

    The funds appropriated to carry out this subchapter for any fiscal year that remain after amounts are reserved under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) shall be divided by the Secretary between national grants and grants to States as follows:

            Allotments for States not affected by paragraphs (1) and (2)(B) shall be reduced proportionally to satisfy the conditions in such paragraphs.

    (e) __Allotments for grants to States__
