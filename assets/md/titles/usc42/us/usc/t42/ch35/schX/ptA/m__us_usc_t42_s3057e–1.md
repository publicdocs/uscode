## § 3057e–1. Distribution of funds among tribal organizations

    (a) __Maintenance of 1991 amounts__ 

        Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this part, the amount of the grant (if any) made under this part to a tribal organization for fiscal year 1992 and for each subsequent fiscal year shall be not less than the amount of the grant made under this part to the tribal organization for fiscal year 1991.

    (b) __Use of additional amounts appropriated__ 

    If the funds appropriated to carry out this part in a fiscal year subsequent to fiscal year 1991 exceed the funds appropriated to carry out this part in fiscal year 1991, then the amount of the grant (if any) made under this part to a tribal organization for the subsequent fiscal year shall be—

        (1) increased by such amount as the Assistant Secretary considers to be appropriate, in addition to the amount of any increase required by subsection (a) of this section, so that the grant equals or more closely approaches the amount of the grant made under this part to the tribal organization for fiscal year 1980; or

        (2) an amount the Assistant Secretary considers to be sufficient if the tribal organization did not receive a grant under this part for either fiscal year 1980 or fiscal year 1991.

    (c) __Clarification__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            In this subsection, the term “covered year” means fiscal year 2006 or a subsequent fiscal year.

        (2) __Consortia of tribal organizations__ 

        If a tribal organization received a grant under this part for fiscal year 1991 as part of a consortium, the Assistant Secretary shall consider the tribal organization to have received a grant under this part for fiscal year 1991 for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), and shall apply the provisions of subsections (a) and (b)(1) (under the conditions described in subsection (b)) to the tribal organization for each covered year for which the tribal organization submits an application under this part, even if the tribal organization submits—

            (A) a separate application from the remaining members of the consortium; or

            (B) an application as 1 of the remaining members of the consortium.
