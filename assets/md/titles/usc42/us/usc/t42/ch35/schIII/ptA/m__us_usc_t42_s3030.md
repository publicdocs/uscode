        (2) Total payments to all States and such tribal organizations under paragraph (1) in any fiscal year shall not exceed 2 percent of the total amount appropriated and available to carry out subchapter IV of this chapter.

        (3) If the Assistant Secretary decides, in the 5-day period beginning on the date such disaster is declared by the President, to provide an amount of reimbursement under paragraph (1) to a State or such tribal organization, then the Assistant Secretary shall provide not less than 75 percent of such amount to such State or such tribal organization not later than 5 days after the date of such decision.

    (b) __Setting aside of funds by Assistant Secretary__ 

        (1) At the beginning of each fiscal year the Assistant Secretary shall set aside, for payment to States and such tribal organizations under subsection (a) of this section, an amount equal to 2 percent of the total amount appropriated and available to carry out subchapter IV of this chapter.
