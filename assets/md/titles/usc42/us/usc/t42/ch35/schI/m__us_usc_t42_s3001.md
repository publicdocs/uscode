    (5) Opportunity for employment with no discriminatory personnel practices because of age.

    (6) Retirement in health, honor, dignity—after years of contribution to the economy.

    (7) Participating in and contributing to meaningful activity within the widest range of civic, cultural, education and training and recreational opportunities.
