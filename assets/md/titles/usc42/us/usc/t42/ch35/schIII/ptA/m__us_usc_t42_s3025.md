    (b) __Planning and service areas__ 

        (1) In carrying out the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the State may designate as a planning and service area any unit of general purpose local government which has a population of 100,000 or more. In any case in which a unit of general purpose local government makes application to the State agency under the preceding sentence to be designated as a planning and service area, the State agency shall, upon request, provide an opportunity for a hearing to such unit of general purpose local government. A State may designate as a planning and service area under subsection (a)(1) of this section, any region within the State recognized for purposes of areawide planning which includes one or more such units of general purpose local government when the State determines that the designation of such a regional planning and service area is necessary for, and will enhance, the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter. The State may include in any planning and service area designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section such additional areas adjacent to the unit of general purpose local government or regions so designated as the State determines to be necessary for, and will enhance the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter.

        (2) The State is encouraged in carrying out the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section to include the area covered by the appropriate economic development district involved in any planning and service area designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section, and to include all portions of an Indian reservation within a single planning and service area, if feasible.

        (3) The chief executive officer of each State in which a planning and service area crosses State boundaries, or in which an interstate Indian reservation is located, may apply to the Assistant Secretary to request redesignation as an interstate planning and service area comprising the entire metropolitan area or Indian reservation. If the Assistant Secretary approves such an application, the Assistant Secretary shall adjust the State allotments of the areas within the planning and service area in which the interstate planning and service area is established to reflect the number of older individuals within the area who will be served by an interstate planning and service area not within the State.

        (4) Whenever a unit of general purpose local government, a region, a metropolitan area or an Indian reservation is denied designation under the provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, such unit of general purpose local government, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation may appeal the decision of the State agency to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary shall afford such unit, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation an opportunity for a hearing. In carrying out the provisions of this paragraph, the Assistant Secretary may approve the decision of the State agency, disapprove the decision of the State agency and require the State agency to designate the unit, region, area, or Indian reservation appealing the decision as a planning and service area, or take such other action as the Assistant Secretary deems appropriate.

        (5)

            (A) A State which on or before October 1, 1980, had designated, with the approval of the Assistant Secretary, a single planning and service area covering all of the older individuals in the State, in which the State agency was administering the area plan, may after that date designate one or more additional planning and service areas within the State to be administered by public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations as area agencies on aging, after considering the factors specified in subsection (a)(1)(E) of this section. The State agency shall continue to perform the functions of an area agency on aging for any area of the State not included in a planning and service area for which an area agency on aging has been designated.

            (B) Whenever a State agency designates a new area agency on aging after October 9, 1984, the State agency shall give the right to first refusal to a unit of general purpose local government if (i) such unit can meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, and (ii) the boundaries of such a unit and the boundaries of the area are reasonably contiguous.

            (C)

                (i)

                 A State agency shall establish and follow appropriate procedures to provide due process to affected parties, if the State agency initiates an action or proceeding to—

                    (I) revoke the designation of the area agency on aging under subsection (a) of this section;

                    (II) designate an additional planning and service area in a State;

                    (III) divide the State into different planning and services  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “service”. </sup></sup>  areas; or

                    (IV) otherwise affect the boundaries of the planning and service areas in the State.

                (ii)

                 The procedures described in clause (i) shall include procedures for—

                    (I) providing notice of an action or proceeding described in clause (i);

                    (II) documenting the need for the action or proceeding;

                    (III) conducting a public hearing for the action or proceeding;

                    (IV) involving area agencies on aging, service providers, and older individuals in the action or proceeding; and

                    (V) allowing an appeal of the decision of the State agency in the action or proceeding to the Assistant Secretary.

                (iii)

                 An adversely affected party involved in an action or proceeding described in clause (i) may bring an appeal described in clause (ii)(V) on the basis of—

                    (I) the facts and merits of the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding; or

                    (II) procedural grounds.

                (iv) In deciding an appeal described in clause (ii)(V), the Assistant Secretary may affirm or set aside the decision of the State agency. If the Assistant Secretary sets aside the decision, and the State agency has taken an action described in subclauses (I) through (III) of clause (i), the State agency shall nullify the action.

    (c) __Eligible State area agencies; development of area; preferred area agency on aging designees__ 

    An area agency on aging designated under subsection (a) of this section shall be—

        (1) an established office of aging which is operating within a planning and service area designated under subsection (a) of this section;

        (2) any office or agency of a unit of general purpose local government, which is designated to function only for the purpose of serving as an area agency on aging by the chief elected official of such unit;

        (3) any office or agency designated by the appropriate chief elected officials of any combination of units of general purpose local government to act only on behalf of such combination for such purpose;

        (4) any public or nonprofit private agency in a planning and service area, or any separate organizational unit within such agency, which is under the supervision or direction for this purpose of the designated State agency and which can and will engage only in the planning or provision of a broad range of supportive services, or nutrition services within such planning and service area; or

        (5) in the case of a State specified in subsection (b)(5) of this section, the State agency;

        and shall provide assurance, determined adequate by the State agency, that the area agency on aging will have the ability to develop an area plan and to carry out, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, a program in accordance with the plan within the planning and service area. In designating an area agency on aging within the planning and service area or within any unit of general purpose local government designated as a planning and service area the State shall give preference to an established office on aging, unless the State agency finds that no such office within the planning and service area will have the capacity to carry out the area plan.

    (d) __Publication for review and comment; contents__ 

    The publication for review and comment required by paragraph (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section shall include—
