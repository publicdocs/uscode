## § 16533. Hydrocarbon systems science talent expansion program for institutions of higher education

    (a) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this section are—

        (1) to address the decline in the number of and resources available to hydrocarbon systems science programs at institutions of higher education; and

        (2) to increase the number of graduates with degrees in hydrocarbon systems science, an area of strategic importance to the economic competitiveness and energy security of the United States.

    (b) __Definition of hydrocarbon systems science__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __In general__ 

            The term “hydrocarbon systems science” means a science involving natural gas or other petroleum exploration, development, or production.

        (2) __Inclusions__ 

        The term “hydrocarbon systems science” includes—

            (A) petroleum or reservoir engineering;

            (B) environmental geoscience;

            (C) petrophysics;

            (D) geophysics;

            (E) geochemistry;

            (F) petroleum geology;

            (G) ocean engineering;

            (H) environmental engineering;

            (I) computer science, as computer science relates to a science described in this subsection; and

            (J) hydrocarbon spill response and remediation.

    (c) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall establish, in accordance with this section, a program to expand and enhance institution of higher education hydrocarbon systems science educational capabilities.

    (d) __Hydrocarbon systems science program expansion grants for institutions of higher education__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award up to 3 competitive grants for each fiscal year to institutions of higher education that establish new academic degree programs in hydrocarbon systems science.

        (2) __Eligibility__ 

            In evaluating grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to proposals that involve partnerships with the National Laboratories, including the National Energy Technology Laboratory, or other hydrocarbon systems scientific entities, as determined by the Secretary.

        (3) __Criteria__ 

        Criteria for a grant awarded under this subsection shall be based on—

            (A) the potential to attract new students to the program;

            (B) academic rigor; and

            (C) the ability to offer hands-on learning opportunities.

        (4) __Duration and amount__ 

            (A) __Duration__ 

                A grant under this subsection may be up to 5 years in duration.

            (B) __Amount__ 

                An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this subsection shall be eligible for up to $1,000,000 for each year of the grant period.

        (5) __Use of funds__ 

        An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this subsection may use the grant to—

            (A) recruit and retain new faculty;

            (B) develop core and specialized course content;

            (C) encourage collaboration between faculty and researchers in the hydrocarbon systems science field; and

            (D) support outreach efforts to recruit students.

    (e) __Hydrocarbon systems science competitiveness grants for institutions of higher education__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award up to 5 competitive grants for each fiscal year to institutions of higher education with existing academic degree programs that produce graduates in hydrocarbon systems science.

        (2) __Criteria__ 

            Criteria for a grant awarded under this subsection shall be based on the potential for increasing the number and academic quality of graduates in hydrocarbon systems sciences who enter into careers in natural gas and other petroleum exploration, development, and production related fields.

        (3) __Duration and amount__ 

            (A) __Duration__ 

                A grant under this subsection may be up to 5 years in duration.

            (B) __Amount__ 

                An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this subsection shall be eligible for up to $500,000 for each year of the grant period.

        (4) __Use of funds__ 

        An institution of higher education that receives a grant under this subsection may use the grant to—

            (A) increase the number of graduates in the hydrocarbon systems sciences that enter into careers in the natural gas and other petroleum exploration, development, and production science fields;

            (B) enhance the teaching of advanced natural gas and other petroleum exploration, development, and production technologies;

            (C) aggressively pursue collaboration opportunities with industry and the National Laboratories, including the National Energy Technology Laboratory;

            (D) bolster or sustain natural gas and other petroleum exploration, development, and production infrastructure and research facilities of the institution of higher education, such as research and training or laboratories; and

            (E) provide tuition assistance and stipends to undergraduate and graduate students.

    (f) __Authorization of appropriations__
