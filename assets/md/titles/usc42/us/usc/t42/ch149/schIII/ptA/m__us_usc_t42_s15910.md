## § 15910. Enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection

    (a) __Production incentive__ 

        (1) __Findings__ 

        Congress finds the following:

            (A) Approximately two-thirds of the original oil in place in the United States remains unproduced.

            (B) Enhanced oil and natural gas production from the sequestering of carbon dioxide and other appropriate gases has the potential to increase oil and natural gas production.

            (C) Capturing and productively using carbon dioxide would help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy.

        (2) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this section is—

            (A) to promote the capturing, transportation, and injection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon dioxide, and other appropriate gases or other matter for sequestration into oil and gas fields; and

            (B) to promote oil and natural gas production from the outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal lands under lease by providing royalty incentives to use enhanced recovery techniques using injection of the substances referred to in subparagraph (A).

    (b) __Suspension of royalties__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the Secretary determines that reduction of the royalty under a Federal oil and gas lease that is an eligible lease is in the public interest and promotes the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall undertake a rulemaking to provide for such reduction for an eligible lease.

        (2) __Rulemakings__ 

            The Secretary shall publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 days after August 8, 2005, and complete the rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after August 8, 2005.

        (3) __Eligible leases__ 

        A lease shall be an eligible lease for purposes of this section if—

            (A) it is a lease for production of oil and gas from the outer Continental Shelf or Federal onshore lands;

            (B) the injection of the substances referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) will be used as an enhanced recovery technique on such lease; and

            (C) the Secretary determines that the lease contains oil or gas that would not likely be produced without the royalty reduction provided under this section.

        (4) __Amount of relief__ 

            The rulemaking shall provide for a suspension volume, which shall not exceed 5,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent for each eligible lease. Such suspension volume shall be applied to any production from an eligible lease occurring on or after the date of publication of any advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection.

        (5) __Limitation__ 

            The Secretary may place limitations on the royalty reduction granted under this section based on market price.

        (6) __Application__ 

            This section shall apply to any eligible lease issued before, on, or after August 8, 2005.

    (c) __Demonstration program__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary of Energy shall establish a competitive grant program to provide grants to producers of oil and gas to carry out projects to inject carbon dioxide for the purpose of enhancing recovery of oil or natural gas while increasing the sequestration of carbon dioxide.

            (B) __Projects__ 

            The demonstration program shall provide for—

                (i) not more than 10 projects in the Willistin Basin in North Dakota and Montana; and

                (ii) 1 project in the Cook Inlet Basin in Alaska.

        (2) __Requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary of Energy shall issue requirements relating to applications for grants under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Rulemaking__ 

                The issuance of requirements under subparagraph (A) shall not require a rulemaking.

            (C) __Minimum requirements__ 

            At a minimum, the Secretary shall require under subparagraph (A) that an application for a grant include—

                (i) a description of the project proposed in the application;

                (ii) an estimate of the production increase and the duration of the production increase from the project, as compared to conventional recovery techniques, including water flooding;

                (iii) an estimate of the carbon dioxide sequestered by project, over the life of the project;

                (iv) a plan to collect and disseminate data relating to each project to be funded by the grant;

                (v) a description of the means by which the project will be sustainable without Federal assistance after the completion of the term of the grant;

                (vi) a complete description of the costs of the project, including acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance costs over the expected life of the project;

                (vii) a description of which costs of the project will be supported by Federal assistance under this section; and

                (viii) a description of any secondary or tertiary recovery efforts in the field and the efficacy of water flood recovery techniques used.

        (3) __Partners__ 

            An applicant for a grant under paragraph (1) may carry out a project under a pilot program in partnership with 1 or more other public or private entities.

        (4) __Selection criteria__ 

        In evaluating applications under this subsection, the Secretary of Energy shall—

            (A) consider the previous experience with similar projects of each applicant; and

            (B)

             give priority consideration to applications that—

                (i) are most likely to maximize production of oil and gas in a cost-effective manner;

                (ii) sequester significant quantities of carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources;

                (iii) demonstrate the greatest commitment on the part of the applicant to ensure funding for the proposed project and the greatest likelihood that the project will be maintained or expanded after Federal assistance under this section is completed; and

                (iv) minimize any adverse environmental effects from the project.

        (5) __Demonstration program requirements__ 

            (A) __Maximum amount__ 

                The Secretary of Energy shall not provide more than $3,000,000 in Federal assistance under this subsection to any applicant.

            (B) __Cost sharing__
