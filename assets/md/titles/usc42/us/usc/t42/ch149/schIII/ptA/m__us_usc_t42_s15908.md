    The Secretary shall carry out a National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program in accordance with this section—

        (1) to archive geologic, geophysical, and engineering data, maps, well logs, and samples;

        (2) to provide a national catalog of such archival material; and

        (3) to provide technical and financial assistance related to the archival material.

    (c) __Plan__ 

        Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a plan for the implementation of the Program.

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            The Secretary shall establish, as a component of the Program, a data archive system to provide for the storage, preservation, and archiving of subsurface, surface, geological, geophysical, and engineering data and samples. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, shall develop guidelines relating to the data archive system, including the types of data and samples to be preserved.

        (2) __System components__ 

            The system shall be comprised of State agencies that elect to be part of the system and agencies within the Department of the Interior that maintain geological and geophysical data and samples that are designated by the Secretary in accordance with this subsection. The Program shall provide for the storage of data and samples through data repositories operated by such agencies.

        (3) __Limitation of designation__ 

            The Secretary may not designate a State agency as a component of the data archive system unless that agency is the agency that acts as the geological survey in the State.

        (4) __Data from Federal land__ 

        The data archive system shall provide for the archiving of relevant subsurface data and samples obtained from Federal land—

            (A) in the most appropriate repository designated under paragraph (2), with preference being given to archiving data in the State in which the data were collected; and

            (B) consistent with all applicable law and requirements relating to confidentiality and proprietary data.

    (e) __National catalog__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        As soon as practicable after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall develop and maintain, as a component of the Program, a national catalog that identifies—

            (B) Review and critique the draft implementation plan prepared by the Secretary under subsection (c).

            (C) Identify useful studies of data archived under the Program that will advance understanding of the Nation’s energy and mineral resources, geologic hazards, and engineering geology.

            (D) Review the progress of the Program in archiving significant data and preventing the loss of such data, and the scientific progress of the studies funded under the Program.

            (E) Include in the annual report to the Secretary required under section 5(b)(3)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 ([43 U.S.C. 31d(b)(3)][/us/usc/t43/s31d/b/3]) an evaluation of the progress of the Program toward fulfilling the purposes of the Program under subsection (b).
