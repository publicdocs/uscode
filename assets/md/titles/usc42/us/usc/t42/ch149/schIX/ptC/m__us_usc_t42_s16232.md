## § 16232. Bioenergy program

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Biomass__ 

        The term “biomass” means—

            (A) any organic material grown for the purpose of being converted to energy;

            (B) any organic byproduct of agriculture (including wastes from food production and processing) that can be converted into energy; or

            (C)

             any waste material that can be converted to energy, is segregated from other waste materials, and is derived from—

                (i) any of the following forest-related resources: mill residues, precommercial thinnings, slash, brush, or otherwise nonmerchantable material; or

                (ii) wood waste materials, including waste pallets, crates, dunnage, manufacturing and construction wood wastes (other than pressure-treated, chemically-treated, or painted wood wastes), and landscape or right-of-way tree trimmings, but not including municipal solid waste, gas derived from the biodegradation of municipal solid waste, or paper that is commonly recycled.

        (2) __Lignocellulosic feedstock__ 

            The term “lignocellulosic feedstock” means any portion of a plant or coproduct from conversion, including crops, trees, forest residues, and agricultural residues not specifically grown for food, including from barley grain, grapeseed, rice bran, rice hulls, rice straw, soybean matter, and sugarcane bagasse.

    (b) __Program__ 

    The Secretary shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for bioenergy, including—

        (1) biopower energy systems;

        (2) biofuels;

        (3) bioproducts;

        (4) integrated biorefineries that may produce biopower, biofuels, and bioproducts;

        (5) cross-cutting research and development in feedstocks; and

        (6) economic analysis.

    (c) __Biofuels and bioproducts__ 

    The goals of the biofuels and bioproducts programs shall be to develop, in partnership with industry and institutions of higher education—

        (1) advanced biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies capable of making fuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks that are price-competitive with gasoline or diesel in either internal combustion engines or fuel cell-powered vehicles;

        (2) advanced biotechnology processes capable of making biofuels and bioproducts with emphasis on development of biorefinery technologies using enzyme-based processing systems;

        (3) advanced biotechnology processes capable of increasing energy production from lignocellulosic feedstocks, with emphasis on reducing the dependence of industry on fossil fuels in manufacturing facilities; and

        (4) other advanced processes that will enable the development of cost-effective bioproducts, including biofuels.

    (d) __Integrated biorefinery demonstration projects__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall carry out a program to demonstrate the commercial application of integrated biorefineries. The Secretary shall ensure geographical distribution of biorefinery demonstrations under this subsection. The Secretary shall not provide more than $100,000,000 under this subsection for any single biorefinery demonstration. In making awards under this subsection, the Secretary shall encourage—

            (A) the demonstration of a wide variety of lignocellulosic feedstocks;

            (B)

             the commercial application of biomass technologies for a variety of uses, including—

                (i) liquid transportation fuels;

                (ii) high-value biobased chemicals;

                (iii) substitutes for petroleum-based feedstocks and products; and

                (iv) energy in the form of electricity or useful heat; and

            (C) the demonstration of the collection and treatment of a variety of biomass feedstocks.

        (2) __Proposals__ 

        Not later than 6 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall solicit proposals for demonstration of advanced biorefineries. The Secretary shall select only proposals that—

            (A) demonstrate that the project will be able to operate profitably without direct Federal subsidy after initial construction costs are paid; and

            (B) enable the biorefinery to be easily replicated.

    (e) __University biodiesel program__ 

    The Secretary shall establish a demonstration program to determine the feasibility of the operation of diesel electric power generators, using biodiesel fuels with ratings as high as B100, at electric generation facilities owned by institutions of higher education. The program shall examine—

        (1) heat rates of diesel fuels with large quantities of cellulosic content;

        (2) the reliability of operation of various fuel blends;

        (3) performance in cold or freezing weather;

        (4) stability of fuel after extended storage; and

        (5) other criteria, as determined by the Secretary.

    (g)  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. No subsec. (f) has been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Biorefinery energy efficiency__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in the operation of biorefinery facilities.

    (h) __Retrofit technologies for the development of ethanol from cellulosic materials__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application on technologies and processes to enable biorefineries that exclusively use corn grain or corn starch as a feedstock to produce ethanol to be retrofitted to accept a range of biomass, including lignocellulosic feedstocks.
