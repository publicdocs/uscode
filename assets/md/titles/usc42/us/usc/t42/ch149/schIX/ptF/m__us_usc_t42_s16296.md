## § 16296. Low-volume oil and gas reservoir research program

    (a) __Definition of GIS__ 

        In this section, the term “GIS” means geographic information systems technology that facilitates the organization and management of data with a geographic component.

    (b) __Program__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to maximize the productive capacity of marginal wells and reservoirs.

    (c) __Data collection__ 

    Under the program, the Secretary shall collect data on—

        (1) the status and location of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;

        (2) the production capacity of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;

        (3) the location of low-pressure gathering facilities and pipelines; and

        (4) the quantity of natural gas vented or flared in association with crude oil production.

    (d) __Analysis__ 

    Under the program, the Secretary shall—

        (1) estimate the remaining producible reserves based on variable pipeline pressures; and

        (2) recommend measures that will enable the continued production of those resources.

    (e) __Study__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may award a grant to an organization of States that contain significant numbers of marginal oil and natural gas wells to conduct an annual study of low-volume natural gas reservoirs.

        (2) __Organization with no GIS capabilities__ 

            If an organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) does not have GIS capabilities, the organization shall contract with an institution of higher education with GIS capabilities.

        (3) __State geologists__ 

            The organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall collaborate with the State geologist of each State being studied.

    (f) __Public information__ 

        The Secretary may use the data collected and analyzed under this section to produce maps and literature to disseminate to States to promote conservation of natural gas reserves.
