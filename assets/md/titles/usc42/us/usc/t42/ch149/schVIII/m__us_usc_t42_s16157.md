## § 16157. Demonstration

    (a) __In general__ 

    In carrying out the programs under this section, the Secretary shall fund a limited number of demonstration projects, consistent with this subchapter and a determination of the maturity, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impacts of technologies supporting each project. In selecting projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable and in the public interest, select projects that—

        (1) involve using hydrogen and related products at existing facilities or installations, such as existing office buildings, military bases, vehicle fleet centers, transit bus authorities, or units of the National Park System;

        (2) depend on reliable power from hydrogen to carry out essential activities;

        (3) lead to the replication of hydrogen technologies and draw such technologies into the marketplace;

        (4) include vehicle, portable, and stationary demonstrations of fuel cell and hydrogen-based energy technologies;

        (5) address the interdependency of demand for hydrogen fuel cell applications and hydrogen fuel infrastructure;

        (6) raise awareness of hydrogen technology among the public;

        (7) facilitate identification of an optimum technology among competing alternatives;

        (8) address distributed generation using renewable sources;

        (9) carry out demonstrations of evolving hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in national parks, remote island areas, and on Indian tribal land, as selected by the Secretary;

        (10)

         carry out a program to demonstrate developmental hydrogen and fuel cell systems for mobile, portable, and stationary uses, using improved versions of the learning demonstrations program concept of the Department including demonstrations involving—

            (A) light-duty vehicles;

            (B) heavy-duty vehicles;

            (C) fleet vehicles;

            (D) specialty industrial and farm vehicles; and

            (E) commercial and residential portable, continuous, and backup electric power generation;

        (11) in accordance with any code or standards developed in a region, fund prototype, pilot fleet, and infrastructure regional hydrogen supply corridors along the interstate highway system in varied climates across the United States; and

        (12) fund demonstration programs that explore the use of hydrogen blends, hybrid hydrogen, and hydrogen reformed from renewable agricultural fuels, including the use of hydrogen in hybrid electric, heavier duty, and advanced internal combustion-powered vehicles.

        The Secretary shall give preference to projects which address multiple elements contained in paragraphs (1) through (12).

    (b) __System demonstrations__ 

        (1)  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. No par. (2) has been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __In general__ 

        As a component of the demonstration program under this section, the Secretary shall provide grants, on a cost share basis as appropriate, to eligible entities (as determined by the Secretary) for use in—

            (A)

             devising system design concepts that provide for the use of advanced composite vehicles in programs under [section 16122 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s16122] that—

                (i) have as a primary goal the reduction of drive energy requirements;

                (ii) after 2010, add another research and development phase, as defined in subsection (c), including the vehicle and infrastructure partnerships developed under the learning demonstrations program concept of the Department; and

                (iii) are managed through an enhanced FreedomCAR program within the Department that encourages involvement in cost-shared projects by manufacturers and governments; and

            (B)

             designing a local distributed energy system that—

                (i) incorporates renewable hydrogen production, off-grid electricity production, and fleet applications in industrial or commercial service;

                (ii) integrates energy or applications described in clause (i), such as stationary, portable, micro, and mobile fuel cells, into a high-density commercial or residential building complex or agricultural community; and

                (iii) is managed in cooperation with industry, State, tribal, and local governments, agricultural organizations, and nonprofit generators and distributors of electricity.

    (c) __Identification of new program requirements__ 

    In carrying out the demonstrations under subsection (a), the Secretary, in consultation with the Task Force and the Technical Advisory Committee, shall—

        (1) after 2008 for stationary and portable applications, and after 2010 for vehicles, identify new requirements that refine technological concepts, planning, and applications; and

        (2) during the second phase of the learning demonstrations under subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii), redesign subsequent program work to incorporate those requirements.

    (d) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

    There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section—

        (1) $185,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;

        (2) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;

        (3) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;

        (4) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2009;

        (5) $375,000,000 for fiscal year 2010; and

        (6) such sums as are necessary for each of fiscal years 2011 through 2020.
