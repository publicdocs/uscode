## § 16294. Research and development for coal mining technologies

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall carry out a program for research and development on coal mining technologies.

    (b) __Cooperation__ 

        In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall cooperate with appropriate Federal agencies, coal producers, trade associations, equipment manufacturers, institutions of higher education with mining engineering departments, and other relevant entities.

    (c) __Program__ 

    The research and development activities carried out under this section shall—

        (1) be guided by the mining research and development priorities identified by the Mining Industry of the Future Program and in the recommendations from relevant reports of the National Academy of Sciences on mining technologies;

        (2) include activities exploring minimization of contaminants in mined coal that contribute to environmental concerns including development and demonstration of electromagnetic wave imaging ahead of mining operations;

        (3)

         develop and demonstrate coal bed electromagnetic wave imaging, spectroscopic reservoir analysis technology, and techniques for horizontal drilling in order to—

            (A) identify areas of high coal gas content;

            (B) increase methane recovery efficiency;
