## § 16295. Oil and gas research programs

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of oil and gas, including—

        (1) exploration and production;

        (2) gas hydrates;

        (3) reservoir life and extension;

        (4) transportation and distribution infrastructure;

        (5) ultraclean fuels;

        (6) heavy oil, oil shale, and tar sands; and

        (7) related environmental research.

    (b) __Objectives__ 

        The objectives of this program shall include advancing the science and technology available to domestic petroleum producers, particularly independent operators, to minimize the economic dislocation caused by the decline of domestic supplies of oil and natural gas resources.

    (c) __Natural gas and oil deposits report__ 

        Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies, shall submit to Congress a report on the latest estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, reserves growth, and undiscovered resources in Federal and State waters off the coast of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi.

        (1) __Establishment of center__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a national center or consortium of excellence in clean energy and power generation, using the resources of the Clean Power and Energy Research Consortium in existence on August 8, 2005, to address the critical dependence of the United States on energy and the need to reduce emissions.

        (2) __Focus areas__ 

        The center or consortium shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application on integrating the following 6 focus areas:

            (A) Efficiency and reliability of gas turbines for power generation.
