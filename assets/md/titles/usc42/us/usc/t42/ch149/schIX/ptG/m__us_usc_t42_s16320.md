## § 16320. Spallation Neutron Source

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __SING__ 

            The term “SING” means the Spallation Neutron Source Instruments Next Generation major item of equipment.

        (2) __SNS power upgrade__ 

            The term “SNS power upgrade” means the Spallation Neutron Source power upgrade described in the 20-year facilities plan of the Office of Science of the Department.

        (3) __SNS second target station__ 

            The term “SNS second target station” means the Spallation Neutron Source second target station described in the 20-year facilities plan of the Office of Science of the Department.

        (4) __Spallation Neutron Source Facility__ 

            The terms “Spallation Neutron Source Facility” and “Facility” mean the completed Spallation Neutron Source scientific user facility located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

        (5) __Spallation Neutron Source Project__ 

            The terms “Spallation Neutron Source Project” and “Project” means Department Project 99–E–334, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

    (b) __Spallation Neutron Source Project__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall submit to Congress, as part of the annual budget request of the President submitted to Congress, a report on progress on the Spallation Neutron Source Project.

        (2) __Contents__ 

        The report shall include for the Project—

            (A) a description of the achievement of milestones;

            (B) a comparison of actual costs to estimated costs; and

            (C) any changes in estimated Project costs or schedule.

    (c) __Spallation Neutron Source Facility plan__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall develop an operational plan for the Spallation Neutron Source Facility that ensures that the Facility is employed to the full capability of the Facility in support of the study of advanced materials, nanoscience, and other missions of the Office of Science of the Department.

        (2) __Plan__ 

        The operational plan shall—

            (A)

             include a plan for the operation of an effective scientific user program that—

                (i) is based on peer review of proposals submitted for use of the Facility;

                (ii) includes scientific and technical support to ensure that external users, including researchers based at institutions of higher education, are able to make full use of a variety of high quality scientific instruments; and

                (iii) phases in systems upgrades to ensure that the Facility remains at the forefront of international scientific endeavors in the field of the Facility throughout the operating life of the Facility;

            (B) include an ongoing program to develop new instruments that builds on the high performance neutron source and that allows neutron scattering techniques to be applied to a growing range of scientific problems and disciplines; and

            (C)

             address the status of and, to the maximum extent practicable, costs and schedules for—

                (i) full user mode operations of the Facility;

                (ii) instrumentation built at the Facility during the operating phase through full use of the experimental hall, including the SING;

                (iii) the SNS power upgrade; and

                (iv) the SNS second target station.

    (d) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        (1) __Spallation Neutron Source Project__ 

        There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the Spallation Neutron Source Project for the lifetime of the Project $1,411,700,000 for total project costs, of which—

            (A) $1,192,700,000 shall be used for the costs of construction; and

            (B) $219,000,000 shall be used for other Project costs.

        (2) __Spallation Neutron Source Facility__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), there is authorized to be appropriated for the Spallation Neutron Source Facility for—

                (i) the SING, $75,000,000 for each of fiscal year 2007 through 2009; and

                (ii) the SNS power upgrade, $160,000,000, to remain available until expended.

            (B) __Insufficient stockpiles of heavy water__ 

                If stockpiles of heavy water of the Department are insufficient to meet the needs of the Facility, there is authorized to be appropriated for the Facility $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.
