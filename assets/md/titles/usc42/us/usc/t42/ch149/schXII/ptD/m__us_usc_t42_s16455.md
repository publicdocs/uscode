    (a) __Commission authority unaffected__ 

        Nothing in this part shall limit the authority of the Commission under the Federal Power Act ([16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.) to require that jurisdictional rates are just and reasonable, including the ability to deny or approve the pass through of costs, the prevention of cross-subsidization, and the issuance of such rules and regulations as are necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility consumers.

    (b) __Recovery of costs__ 

        Nothing in this part shall preclude the Commission or a State commission from exercising its jurisdiction under otherwise applicable law to determine whether a public-utility company, public utility, or natural gas company may recover in rates any costs of an activity performed by an associate company, or any costs of goods or services acquired by such public-utility company from an associate company.
