## § 15902. Program on oil and gas royalties in-kind

    (a) __Applicability of section__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section applies to all royalty in-kind accepted by the Secretary on or after August 8, 2005, under any Federal oil or gas lease or permit under—

        (1) [section 192 of title 30][/us/usc/t30/s192];

        (2) [section 1353 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1353]; or

        (3) any other Federal law governing leasing of Federal land for oil and gas development.

    (b) __Terms and conditions__ 

    All royalty accruing to the United States shall, on the demand of the Secretary, be paid in-kind. If the Secretary makes such a demand, the following provisions apply to the payment:

        (1) __Satisfaction of royalty obligation__ 

            Delivery by, or on behalf of, the lessee of the royalty amount and quality due under the lease satisfies royalty obligation of the lessee for the amount delivered, except that transportation and processing reimbursements paid to, or deductions claimed by, the lessee shall be subject to review and audit.

        (2) __Marketable condition__ 

            (A) __Definition of marketable condition__ 

                In this paragraph, the term “in marketable condition” means sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that the royalty production will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical of the field or area in which the royalty production was produced.

            (B) __Requirement__ 

                Royalty production shall be placed in marketable condition by the lessee at no cost to the United States.

        (3) __Disposition by the Secretary__ 

        The Secretary may—

            (A) sell or otherwise dispose of any royalty production taken in-kind (other than oil or gas transferred under [section 1353(a)(3) of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1353/a/3]  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis. </sup></sup>  for not less than the market price; and

            (B) transport or process (or both) any royalty production taken in-kind.

        (4) __Retention by the Secretary__ 

        The Secretary may, notwithstanding [section 3302 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3302], retain and use a portion of the revenues from the sale of oil and gas taken in-kind that otherwise would be deposited to miscellaneous receipts, without regard to fiscal year limitation, or may use oil or gas received as royalty taken in-kind (referred to in this paragraph as “royalty production”) to pay the cost of—

            (A) transporting the royalty production;

            (B) processing the royalty production;

            (C) disposing of the royalty production; or

            (D) any combination of transporting, processing, and disposing of the royalty production.

        (5) __Limitation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not use revenues from the sale of oil and gas taken in-kind to pay for personnel, travel, or other administrative costs of the Federal Government.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may use a portion of the revenues from royalty in-kind sales, without fiscal year limitation, to pay salaries and other administrative costs directly related to the royalty in-kind program.

    (c) __Reimbursement of cost__ 

    If the lessee, pursuant to an agreement with the United States or as provided in the lease, processes the royalty gas or delivers the royalty oil or gas at a point not on or adjacent to the lease area, the Secretary shall—

        (1) reimburse the lessee for the reasonable costs of transportation (not including gathering) from the lease to the point of delivery or for processing costs; or

        (2) allow the lessee to deduct the transportation or processing costs in reporting and paying royalties in-value for other Federal oil and gas leases.

    (d) __Benefit to the United States required__ 

        The Secretary may receive oil or gas royalties in-kind only if the Secretary determines that receiving royalties in-kind provides benefits to the United States that are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.

    (e) __Deduction of expenses__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Before making payments under [section 191 of title 30][/us/usc/t30/s191] or [section 1337(g) of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1337/g] of revenues derived from the sale of royalty production taken in-kind from a lease, the Secretary shall deduct amounts paid or deducted under subsections (b)(4) and (c) and deposit the amount of the deductions in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.

        (2) __Accounting for deductions__ 

            When the Secretary allows the lessee to deduct transportation or processing costs under subsection (c), the Secretary may not reduce any payments to recipients of revenues derived from any other Federal oil and gas lease as a consequence of that deduction.

    (f) __Consultation with States__ 

    The Secretary—

        (1) shall consult with a State before conducting a royalty in-kind program under this part within the State;

        (2) may delegate management of any portion of the Federal royalty in-kind program to the State except as otherwise prohibited by Federal law; and

        (3) shall consult annually with any State from which Federal oil or gas royalty is being taken in-kind to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the royalty in-kind program provides revenues to the State greater than or equal to the revenues likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.

    (g) __Small refineries__ 

        (1) __Preference__ 

            If the Secretary finds that sufficient supplies of crude oil are not available in the open market to refineries that do not have their own source of supply for crude oil, the Secretary may grant preference to those refineries in the sale of any royalty oil accruing or reserved to the United States under Federal oil and gas leases issued under any mineral leasing law, for processing or use in those refineries at private sale at not less than the market price.

        (2) __Proration among refineries in production area__ 

            In disposing of oil under this subsection, the Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, prorate the oil among refineries described in paragraph (1) in the area in which the oil is produced.

    (h) __Disposition to Federal agencies__ 

        (1) __Onshore royalty__ 

            Any royalty oil or gas taken by the Secretary in-kind from onshore oil and gas leases may be sold at not less than the market price to any Federal agency.

        (2) __Offshore royalty__ 

            Any royalty oil or gas taken in-kind from a Federal oil or gas lease on the outer Continental Shelf may be disposed of only under [section 1353 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1353].

    (i) __Federal low-income energy assistance programs__ 

        (1) __Preference__ 

            In disposing of royalty oil or gas taken in-kind under this section, the Secretary may grant a preference to any person, including any Federal or State agency, for the purpose of providing additional resources to any Federal low-income energy assistance program.

        (2) __Report__ 

        Not later than 3 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress—

            (A) assessing the effectiveness of granting preferences specified in paragraph (1); and

            (B) providing a specific recommendation on the continuation of authority to grant preferences.
