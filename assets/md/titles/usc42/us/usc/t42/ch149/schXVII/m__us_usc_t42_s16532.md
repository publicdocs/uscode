## § 16532. Nuclear science talent expansion program for institutions of higher education

    (a) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this section are—

        (1) to address the decline in the number of and resources available to nuclear science programs at institutions of higher education; and

        (2) to increase the number of graduates with degrees in nuclear science, an area of strategic importance to the economic competitiveness and energy security of the United States.

    (b) __Definition of nuclear science__ 

    In this section, the term “nuclear science” includes—

        (1) nuclear science;

        (2) nuclear engineering;

        (3) nuclear chemistry;

        (4) radio chemistry; and

        (5) health physics.

    (c) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall establish, in accordance with this section, a program to expand and enhance institution of higher education nuclear science educational capabilities.

    (d) __Nuclear science program expansion grants for institutions of higher education__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award up to 3 competitive grants for each fiscal year to institutions of higher education that establish new academic degree programs in nuclear science.

        (2) __Priority__ 

            In evaluating grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to proposals that involve partnerships with a National Laboratory or other eligible nuclear-related entity, as determined by the Secretary.

        (3) __Criteria__ 

        Criteria for a grant awarded under this subsection shall be based on—

            (A) the potential to attract new students to the program;

            (B) academic rigor; and

            (A) recruit and retain new faculty;

            (B) develop core and specialized course content;

            (C) encourage collaboration between faculty and researchers in the nuclear science field; and

            (D) support outreach efforts to recruit students.

    (e) __Nuclear science competitiveness grants for institutions of higher education__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award up to 5 competitive grants for each fiscal year to institutions of higher education with existing academic degree programs that produce graduates in nuclear science.

        (2) __Criteria__ 

            Criteria for a grant awarded under this subsection shall be based on the potential for increasing the number and academic quality of graduates in the nuclear sciences who enter into careers in nuclear-related fields.

        (3) __Duration and amount__
