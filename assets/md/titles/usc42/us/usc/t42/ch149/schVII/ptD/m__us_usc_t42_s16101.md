        The Secretary shall (in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency) establish a cost-shared, public-private research partnership involving the Federal Government, railroad carriers, locomotive manufacturers and equipment suppliers, and the Association of American Railroads, to develop and demonstrate railroad locomotive technologies that increase fuel economy, reduce emissions, and lower costs of operation.

    (b) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section—

        (1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;
