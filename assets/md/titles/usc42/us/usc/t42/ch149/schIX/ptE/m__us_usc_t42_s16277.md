## § 16277. Alternatives to industrial radioactive sources

    (a) __Survey__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than August 1, 2006, the Secretary shall submit to Congress the results of a survey of industrial applications of large radioactive sources.

        (2) __Administration__ 

        The survey shall—

            (A) consider well-logging sources as one class of industrial sources;

            (B) include information on current domestic and international Department, Department of Defense, State Department, and commercial programs to manage and dispose of radioactive sources; and

            (C) analyze available disposal options for currently deployed or future sources and, if deficiencies are noted for either deployed or future sources, recommend legislative options that Congress may consider to remedy identified deficiencies.

    (b) __Plan__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In conjunction with the survey conducted under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish a research and development program to develop alternatives to sources described in subsection (a) that reduce safety, environmental, or proliferation risks to either workers using the sources or the public.

        (2) __Accelerators__ 

            Miniaturized particle accelerators for well-logging or other industrial applications and portable accelerators for production of short-lived radioactive materials at an industrial site shall be considered as part of the research and development efforts.

        (3) __Report__ 

            Not later than August 1, 2006, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing the details of the program plan.
