## § 16104. Reduction of engine idling

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Administrator__ 

            The term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

        (2) __Advanced truck stop electrification system__ 

            The term “advanced truck stop electrification system” means a stationary system that delivers heat, air conditioning, electricity, or communications, and is capable of providing verifiable and auditable evidence of use of those services, to a heavy-duty vehicle and any occupants of the heavy-duty vehicle with or without relying on components mounted onboard the heavy-duty vehicle for delivery of those services.

        (3) __Auxiliary power unit__ 

        The term “auxiliary power unit” means an integrated system that—

            (A) provides heat, air conditioning, engine warming, or electricity to components on a heavy-duty vehicle; and

            (B) is certified by the Administrator under part 89 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation), as meeting applicable emission standards.

        (4) __Heavy-duty vehicle__ 

        The term “heavy-duty vehicle” means a vehicle that—

            (A) has a gross vehicle weight rating greater than 8,500 pounds; and

            (B) is powered by a diesel engine.

        (5) __Idle reduction technology__ 

        The term “idle reduction technology” means an advanced truck stop electrification system, auxiliary power unit, or other technology that—

            (A) is used to reduce long-duration idling; and

            (B) allows for the main drive engine or auxiliary refrigeration engine to be shut down.

        (6) __Energy conservation technology__ 

            the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be capitalized. </sup></sup>  term “energy conservation technology” means any device, system of devices, or equipment that improves the fuel economy.

        (7) __Long-duration idling__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “long-duration idling” means the operation of a main drive engine or auxiliary refrigeration engine, for a period greater than 15 consecutive minutes, at a time at which the main drive engine is not engaged in gear.

            (B) __Exclusions__ 

                The term “long-duration idling” does not include the operation of a main drive engine or auxiliary refrigeration engine during a routine stoppage associated with traffic movement or congestion.

    (b) __Idle reduction technology benefits, programs, and studies__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Administrator shall—

            (A)

                (i) commence a review of the mobile source air emission models of the Environmental Protection Agency used under the Clean Air Act ([42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.) to determine whether the models accurately reflect the emissions resulting from long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles and other vehicles and engines; and

                (ii) update those models as the Administrator determines to be appropriate; and

            (B)

                (i) commence a review of the emission reductions achieved by the use of idle reduction technology; and

                (ii) complete such revisions of the regulations and guidance of the Environmental Protection Agency as the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

        (2) __Deadline for completion__ 

        Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Administrator shall—

            (A) complete the reviews under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(i) of paragraph (1); and

            (B) prepare and make publicly available one or more reports on the results of the reviews.

        (3) __Discretionary inclusions__ 

            The reviews under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(i) of paragraph (1) and the reports under paragraph (2)(B) may address the potential fuel savings resulting from use of idle reduction technology.

        (4) __Idle reduction and energy conservation deployment program__ 

            (A) __Establishment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation shall, through the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, establish a program to support deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies.

                (ii) __Priority__ 

                    The Administrator shall give priority to the deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies based on the costs and beneficial effects on air quality and ability to lessen the emission of criteria air pollutants.

            (B) __Funding__ 

                (i) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

                    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out subparagraph (A) for the purpose of reducing extended idling from heavy-duty vehicles $19,500,000 for fiscal year 2006, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $45,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.

                (ii) __Locomotives__ 

                    There are authorized to be appropriated to the administrator to carry out subparagraph (A) for the purpose of reducing extended idling from locomotives $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.

                (iii) __Cost sharing__ 

                    Subject to clause (iv), the Administrator shall require at least 50 percent of the costs directly and specifically related to any project under this section to be provided from non-Federal sources.

                (iv) __Necessary and appropriate reductions__ 

                    The Administrator may reduce the non-Federal requirement under clause (iii) if the Administrator determines that the reduction is necessary and appropriate to meet the objectives of this section.

        (5) __Idling location study__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall commence a study to analyze all locations at which heavy-duty vehicles stop for long-duration idling, including—

                (i) truck stops;

                (ii) rest areas;
