## § 16422. Advanced transmission technologies

    (a) __Definition of advanced transmission technology__ 

    In this section, the term “advanced transmission technology” means a technology that increases the capacity, efficiency, or reliability of an existing or new transmission facility, including—

        (1) high-temperature lines (including superconducting cables);

        (2) underground cables;

        (3) advanced conductor technology (including advanced composite conductors, high-temperature low-sag conductors, and fiber optic temperature sensing conductors);

        (4) high-capacity ceramic electric wire, connectors, and insulators;

        (5) optimized transmission line configurations (including multiple phased transmission lines);

        (6) modular equipment;

        (7) wireless power transmission;

        (8) ultra-high voltage lines;

        (9) high-voltage DC technology;

        (10) flexible AC transmission systems;

        (11) energy storage devices (including pumped hydro, compressed air, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheels, and batteries);

        (12) controllable load;

        (13) distributed generation (including PV, fuel cells, and microturbines);

        (14) enhanced power device monitoring;

        (15) direct system state sensors;

        (16) fiber optic technologies;

        (17) power electronics and related software (including real time monitoring and analytical software);

        (18) mobile transformers and mobile substations; and

        (19) any other technologies the Commission considers appropriate.

    (b) __Authority__ 

        In carrying out the Federal Power Act ([16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ([16 U.S.C. 2601][/us/usc/t16/s2601] et seq.), the Commission shall encourage, as appropriate, the deployment of advanced transmission technologies.
