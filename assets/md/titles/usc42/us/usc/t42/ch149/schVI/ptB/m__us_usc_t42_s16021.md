        (1) is based on research and development activities supported by the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative under section 16272(d)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title; and

        (2)

([Pub. L. 109–58, title VI][/us/pl/109/58/tVI], § 641, Aug. 8, 2005, [119 Stat. 794][/us/stat/119/794].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 16272(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s16272/d], referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original a reference to [section 942(d) of Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58/s942/d], which is classified to [section 16251(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s16251/d] but was translated as meaning [section 952(d) of Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58/s952/d] to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 952(d) relates to Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative and section 942(d) relates to limitations on production incentives for cellulosic biofuels.
