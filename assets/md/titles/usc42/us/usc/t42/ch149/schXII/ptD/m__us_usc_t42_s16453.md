## § 16453. State access to books and records

    (a) __In general__ 

    Upon the written request of a State commission having jurisdiction to regulate a public-utility company in a holding company system, the holding company or any associate company or affiliate thereof, other than such public-utility company, wherever located, shall produce for inspection books, accounts, memoranda, and other records that—

        (1) have been identified in reasonable detail in a proceeding before the State commission;

        (2) the State commission determines are relevant to costs incurred by such public-utility company; and

        (3) are necessary for the effective discharge of the responsibilities of the State commission with respect to such proceeding.

    (b) __Limitation__ 

        Subsection (a) does not apply to any person that is a holding company solely by reason of ownership of one or more qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ([16 U.S.C. 2601][/us/usc/t16/s2601] et seq.).

    (c) __Confidentiality of information__ 

        The production of books, accounts, memoranda, and other records under subsection (a) shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be necessary and appropriate to safeguard against unwarranted disclosure to the public of any trade secrets or sensitive commercial information.

    (d) __Effect on State law__ 

        Nothing in this section shall preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of books, accounts, memoranda, and other records, or in any way limit the rights of any State to obtain books, accounts, memoranda, and other records under any other Federal law, contract, or otherwise.

    (e) __Court jurisdiction__ 

        Any United States district court located in the State in which the State commission referred to in subsection (a) is located shall have jurisdiction to enforce compliance with this section.
