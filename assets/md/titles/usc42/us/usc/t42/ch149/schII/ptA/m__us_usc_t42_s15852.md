## § 15852. Federal purchase requirement

    (a) __Requirement__ 

    The President, acting through the Secretary, shall seek to ensure that, to the extent economically feasible and technically practicable, of the total amount of electric energy the Federal Government consumes during any fiscal year, the following amounts shall be renewable energy:

        (1) Not less than 3 percent in fiscal years 2007 through 2009.

        (2) Not less than 5 percent in fiscal years 2010 through 2012.

        (3) Not less than 7.5 percent in fiscal year 2013 and each fiscal year thereafter.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Biomass__ 

        The term “biomass” means any lignin waste material that is segregated from other waste materials and is determined to be nonhazardous by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and any solid, nonhazardous, cellulosic material that is derived from—

            (A) any of the following forest-related resources: mill residues, precommercial thinnings, slash, and brush, or nonmerchantable material;

            (B) solid wood waste materials, including waste pallets, crates, dunnage, manufacturing and construction wood wastes (other than pressure-treated, chemically-treated, or painted wood wastes), and landscape or right-of-way tree trimmings, but not including municipal solid waste (garbage), gas derived from the biodegradation of solid waste, or paper that is commonly recycled;

            (C) agriculture wastes, including orchard tree crops, vineyard, grain, legumes, sugar, and other crop by-products or residues, and livestock waste nutrients; or

            (D) a plant that is grown exclusively as a fuel for the production of electricity.

        (2) __Renewable energy__ 

            The term “renewable energy” means electric energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current, and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project.

    (c) __Calculation__ 

    For purposes of determining compliance with the requirement of this section, the amount of renewable energy shall be doubled if—

        (1) the renewable energy is produced and used on-site at a Federal facility;

        (2) the renewable energy is produced on Federal lands and used at a Federal facility; or

        (3) the renewable energy is produced on Indian land as defined in title XXVI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ([25 U.S.C. 3501][/us/usc/t25/s3501] et seq.) and used at a Federal facility.

    (d) __Report__ 

        Not later than April 15, 2007, and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall provide a report to Congress on the progress of the Federal Government in meeting the goals established by this section.
