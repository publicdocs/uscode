    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Program__ 

            The term “program” means the Conserve by Bicycling Program established by subsection (b).

        (2) __Secretary__ 

            The term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Transportation.

    (b) __Establishment__ 

        There is established within the Department of Transportation a program to be known as the “Conserve by Bicycling Program”.

    (c) __Projects__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall establish not more than 10 pilot projects that are—

            (A) dispersed geographically throughout the United States; and

            (B) designed to conserve energy resources by encouraging the use of bicycles in place of motor vehicles.

        (2) __Requirements__ 

        A pilot project described in paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) use education and marketing to convert motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips;

            (B) document project results and energy savings (in estimated units of energy conserved);

            (C)

             facilitate partnerships among interested parties in at least 2 of the fields of—

                (i) transportation;

                (ii) law enforcement;

                (iii) education;

                (iv) public health;

                (v) environment; and

                (vi) energy;

            (F) facilitate the continuation of ongoing programs that are sustained by local resources.

        (3) __Cost sharing__ 

            At least 20 percent of the cost of each pilot project described in paragraph (1) shall be provided from non-Federal sources.

    (d) __Energy and bicycling research study__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences for, and the National Academy of Sciences shall conduct and submit to Congress a report on, a study on the feasibility of converting motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips.

                (iii) the carrying capacity of bicycles; and

                (iv) bicycle infrastructure;

            (C) determine any energy savings that would result from the conversion of motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips;

            (D) include a cost-benefit analysis of bicycle infrastructure investments; and

            (E) include a description of any factors that would encourage more motor vehicle trips to be replaced with bicycle trips.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__
