            The obligation shall be subject to the condition that the obligation is not subordinate to other financing.

    (e) __Interest rate__

                Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the guarantee the unpaid interest on, and unpaid principal of the obligation as to which the borrower has defaulted, unless the Secretary finds that there was no default by the borrower in the payment of interest or principal or that the default has been remedied.

                (ii) it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of the project; and

                (iii) the probable net benefit to the Federal Government in paying the principal and interest will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default;

            (B) the amount of the payment that the Secretary is authorized to pay shall be no greater than the amount of principal and interest that the borrower is obligated to pay under the agreement being guaranteed; and
