## § 6992b. Tracking of medical waste

    (a) __Demonstration program__ 

    Not later than 6 months after November 1, 1988, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing a program for the tracking of the medical waste listed in [section 6992a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6992a] which is generated in a State subject to the demonstration program. The program shall (1) provide for tracking of the transportation of the waste from the generator to the disposal facility, except that waste that is incinerated need not be tracked after incineration, (2) include a system for providing the generator of the waste with assurance that the waste is received by the disposal facility, (3) use a uniform form for tracking in each of the demonstration States, and (4) include the following requirements:

        (A) A requirement for segregation of the waste at the point of generation where practicable.

        (B) A requirement for placement of the waste in containers that will protect waste handlers and the public from exposure.

        (C) A requirement for appropriate labeling of containers of the waste.

    (b) __Small quantities__ 

        In the program under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator may establish an exemption for generators of small quantities of medical waste listed under [section 6992a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6992a], except that the Administrator may not exempt from the program any person who, or facility that, generates 50 pounds or more of such waste in any calendar month.

    (c) __On-site incinerators__ 

        Concurrently with the promulgation of regulations under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall promulgate a recordkeeping and reporting requirement for any generator in a demonstration State of medical waste listed in [section 6992a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6992a] that (1) incinerates medical waste listed in [section 6992a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6992a] on site and (2) does not track such waste under the regulations promulgated under subsection (a) of this section. Such requirement shall require the generator to report to the Administrator on the volume and types of medical waste listed in [section 6992a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6992a] that the generator incinerated on site during the 6 months following the effective date of the requirements of this subsection.

    (d) __Type of medical waste and types of generators__ 

        For each of the requirements of this section, the regulations may vary for different types of medical waste and for different types of medical waste generators.
