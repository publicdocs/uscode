## § 6901a. Congressional findings: used oil recycling

    The Congress finds and declares that—

    (1) used oil is a valuable source of increasingly scarce energy and materials;

    (2) technology exists to re-refine, reprocess, reclaim, and otherwise recycle used oil;

    (3) used oil constitutes a threat to public health and the environment when reused or disposed of improperly; and

    that, therefore, it is in the national interest to recycle used oil in a manner which does not constitute a threat to public health and the environment and which conserves energy and materials.

([Pub. L. 96–463, § 2][/us/pl/96/463/s2], Oct. 15, 1980, [94 Stat. 2055][/us/stat/94/2055].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Used Oil Re­cycling Act of 1980, and not as part of the Solid Waste Disposal Act which comprises this chapter.
