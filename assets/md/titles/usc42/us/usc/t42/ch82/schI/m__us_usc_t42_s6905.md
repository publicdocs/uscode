## § 6905. Application of chapter and integration with other Acts

    (a) __Application of chapter__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply to (or to authorize any State, interstate, or local authority to regulate) any activity or substance which is subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \[[33 U.S.C. 1251][/us/usc/t33/s1251] et seq.\], the Safe Drinking Water Act \[[42 U.S.C. 300f][/us/usc/t42/s300f] et seq.\], the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 \[[16 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t16/s1431] et seq., 1447 et seq., [33 U.S.C. 1401][/us/usc/t33/s1401] et seq., 2801 et seq.\], or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \[[42 U.S.C. 2011][/us/usc/t42/s2011] et seq.\] except to the extent that such application (or regulation) is not inconsistent with the requirements of such Acts.

    (b) __Integration with other Acts__ 

        (1) The Administrator shall integrate all provisions of this chapter for purposes of administration and enforcement and shall avoid duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, with the appropriate provisions of the Clean Air Act \[[42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.\], the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \[[33 U.S.C. 1251][/us/usc/t33/s1251] et seq.\], the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act \[[7 U.S.C. 136][/us/usc/t7/s136] et seq.\], the Safe Drinking Water Act \[[42 U.S.C. 300f][/us/usc/t42/s300f] et seq.\], the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 \[[16 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t16/s1431] et seq., 1447 et seq., [33 U.S.C. 1401][/us/usc/t33/s1401] et seq., 2801 et seq.\], and such other Acts of Congress as grant regulatory authority to the Administrator. Such integration shall be effected only to the extent that it can be done in a manner consistent with the goals and policies expressed in this chapter and in the other acts referred to in this subsection.

        (2)

            (A)

             As promptly as practicable after November 8, 1984, the Administrator shall submit a report describing—

                (i) the current data and information available on emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins from resource recovery facilities burning municipal solid waste;

                (ii) any significant risks to human health posed by these emissions; and

                (iii) operating practices appropriate for controlling these emissions.

            (B) Based on the report under subparagraph (A) and on any future information on such emissions, the Administrator may publish advisories or guidelines regarding the control of dioxin emissions from such facilities. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to preempt or otherwise affect the authority of the Administrator to promulgate any regulations under the Clean Air Act \[[42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.\] regarding emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins.

        (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, in developing solid waste plans, it is the intention of this chapter that in determining the size of a waste-to-energy facility, adequate provisions shall be given to the present and reasonably anticipated future needs, including those needs created by thorough implementation of [section 6962(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6962/h], of the recycling and resource recovery interests within the area encompassed by the solid waste plan.

    (c) __Integration with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977__ 

        (1) No later than 90 days after October 21, 1980, the Administrator shall review any regulations applicable to the treatment, storage, or disposal of any coal mining wastes or overburden promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior under the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977 \[[30 U.S.C. 1201][/us/usc/t30/s1201] et seq.\]. If the Administrator determines that any requirement of final regulations promulgated under any section of subchapter III relating to mining wastes or overburden is not adequately addressed in such regulations promulgated by the Secretary, the Administrator shall promptly transmit such determination, together with suggested revisions and supporting documentation, to the Secretary.

        (2) The Secretary of the Interior shall have exclusive responsibility for carrying out any requirement of subchapter III of this chapter with respect to coal mining wastes or overburden for which a surface coal mining and reclamation permit is issued or approved under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 \[[30 U.S.C. 1201][/us/usc/t30/s1201] et seq.\]. The Secretary shall, with the concurrence of the Administrator, promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection and shall integrate such regulations with regulations promulgated under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
