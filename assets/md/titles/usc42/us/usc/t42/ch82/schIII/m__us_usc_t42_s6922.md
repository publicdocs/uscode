## § 6922. Standards applicable to generators of hazardous waste

    (a) __In general__ 

    Not later than eighteen months after October 21, 1976, and after notice and opportunity for public hearings and after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing such standards, applicable to generators of hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. Such standards shall establish requirements respecting—

        (1) recordkeeping practices that accurately identify the quantities of such hazardous waste generated, the constituents thereof which are significant in quantity or in potential harm to human health or the environment, and the disposition of such wastes;

        (2) labeling practices for any containers used for the storage, transport, or disposal of such hazardous waste such as will identify accurately such waste;

        (3) use of appropriate containers for such hazardous waste;

        (4) furnishing of information on the general chemical composition of such hazardous waste to persons transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of such wastes;

        (5) use of a manifest system and any other reasonable means necessary to assure that all such hazardous waste generated is designated for treatment, storage, or disposal in, and arrives at, treatment, storage, or disposal facilities (other than facilities on the premises where the waste is generated) for which a permit has been issued as provided in this subchapter, or pursuant to title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act ([86 Stat. 1052][/us/stat/86/1052]) \[[33 U.S.C. 1411][/us/usc/t33/s1411] et seq.\]; and

        (6)

         submission of reports to the Administrator (or the State agency in any case in which such agency carries out a permit program pursuant to this subchapter) at least once every two years, setting out—

            (A) the quantities and nature of hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter that he has generated during the year;

            (B) the disposition of all hazardous waste reported under subparagraph (A);

            (C) the efforts undertaken during the year to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste generated; and

            (D) the changes in volume and toxicity of waste actually achieved during the year in question in comparison with previous years, to the extent such information is available for years prior to November 8, 1984.

    (b) __Waste minimization__ 

    Effective September 1, 1985, the manifest required by subsection (a)(5) of this section shall contain a certification by the generator that—

        (1) the generator of the hazardous waste has a program in place to reduce the volume or quantity and toxicity of such waste to the degree determined by the generator to be economically practicable; and

        (2) the proposed method of treatment, storage, or disposal is that practicable method currently available to the generator which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment.

L. 95–609, § 7(f)][/us/pl/95/609/s7/f], Nov. 8, 1978, [92 Stat. 3082][/us/stat/92/3082]; [Pub. L. 96–482, § 8][/us/pl/96/482/s8], Oct. 21, 1980, [94 Stat. 2338][/us/stat/94/2338]; [Pub.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(5), probably means the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, [Pub. L. 92–532][/us/pl/92/532], Oct. 23, 1972, [86 Stat. 1052][/us/stat/86/1052], as amended. Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 is classified generally to subchapter I (§ 1411 et seq.) of chapter 27 of Title 33, Navigation and Navigable Waters. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1401 of Title 33][/us/usc/t33/s1401] and Tables.

    “(A) the quantities of hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter that he has generated during a particular time period; and

    “(B) the disposition of all hazardous waste reported under subparagraph (A).”

    1980—Par. (5). [Pub. L. 96–482][/us/pl/96/482] inserted “and any other reasonable means necessary” and “, and arrives at,” after “use of a manifest system” and “disposal in”, respectively.

    1978—Par. (5). [Pub. L. 95–609, § 7(f)(1)][/us/pl/95/609/s7/f/1], inserted provision relating to title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act.
