## § 6930. Effective date

    (a) __Preliminary notification__ 

    Not later than ninety days after promulgation of regulations under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921] identifying by its characteristics or listing any substance as hazardous waste subject to this subchapter, any person generating or transporting such substance or owning or operating a facility for treatment, storage, or disposal of such substance shall file with the Administrator (or with States having authorized hazardous waste permit programs under [section 6926 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6926]) a notification stating the location and general description of such activity and the identified or listed hazardous wastes handled by such person. Not later than fifteen months after November 8, 1984—

        (1) the owner or operator of any facility which produces a fuel (A) from any hazardous waste identified or listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921], (B) from such hazardous waste identified or listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921] and any other material, (C) from used oil, or (D) from used oil and any other material;

        (2) the owner or operator of any facility (other than a single- or two-family residence) which burns for purposes of energy recovery any fuel produced as provided in paragraph (1) or any fuel which otherwise contains used oil or any hazardous waste identified or listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921]; and

        (3) any person who distributes or markets any fuel which is produced as provided in paragraph (1) or any fuel which otherwise contains used oil or any hazardous waste identified or listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921]  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

        shall file with the Administrator (and with the State in the case of a State with an authorized hazardous waste program) a notification stating the location and general description of the facility, together with a description of the identified or listed hazardous waste involved and, in the case of a facility referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), a description of the production or energy recovery activity carried out at the facility and such other information as the Administrator deems necessary. For purposes of the preceding provisions, the term “hazardous waste listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921]” also includes any commercial chemical product which is listed under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921] and which, in lieu of its original intended use, is (i) produced for use as (or as a component of) a fuel, (ii) distributed for use as a fuel, or (iii) burned as a fuel. Notification shall not be required under the second sentence of this subsection in the case of facilities (such as residential boilers) where the Administrator determines that such notification is not necessary in order for the Administrator to obtain sufficient information respecting current practices of facilities using hazardous waste for energy recovery. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect or impair the provisions of [section 6921(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921/b/3]. Nothing in this subsection shall affect regulatory determinations under [section 6935 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6935]. In revising any regulation under [section 6921 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921] identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as hazardous waste subject to this subchapter, the Administrator may require any person referred to in the preceding provisions to file with the Administrator (or with States having authorized hazardous waste permit programs under [section 6926 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6926]) the notification described in the preceding provisions. Not more than one such notification shall be required to be filed with respect to the same substance. No identified or listed hazardous waste subject to this subchapter may be transported, treated, stored, or disposed of unless notification has been given as required under this subsection.

    (b) __Effective date of regulation__ 

    The regulations under this subchapter respecting requirements applicable to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste (including requirements respecting permits for such treatment, storage, or disposal) shall take effect on the date six months after the date of promulgation thereof (or six months after the date of revision in the case of any regulation which is revised after the date required for promulgation thereof). At the time a regulation is promulgated, the Administrator may provide for a shorter period prior to the effective date, or an immediate effective date for:

        (1) a regulation with which the Administrator finds the regulated community does not need six months to come into compliance;

        (2) a regulation which responds to an emergency situation; or

        (3) other good cause found and published with the regulation.

L. 96–482][/us/pl/96/482] struck out “or revision” after “after promulgation or revision of regulations” and inserted provision for filing of notification when revising any regulation identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as hazardous waste subject to this subchapter.
