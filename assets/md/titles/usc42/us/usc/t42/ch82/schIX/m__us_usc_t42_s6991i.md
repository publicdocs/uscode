            (E) the nature of the businesses in which the tank operators are engaged;

            (F) the substantial differences in the scope and length of training needed for the different classes of persons described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1); and

        (1) meet the training requirements developed under subsection (b) of this section; and

        (2)

         repeat the applicable requirements developed under subsection (b) of this section, if the tank for which they have primary daily on-site management responsibilities is determined to be out of compliance with—

            (A) a requirement or standard promulgated by the Administrator under [section 6991b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6991b]; or

            (B) a requirement or standard of a State program approved under [section 6991c of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6991c].
