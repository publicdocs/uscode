        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than January 1, 2010, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) shall designate a facility or facilities of the Department of Energy, which shall not include the Y–12 National Security Complex or any other portion or facility of the Oak Ridge Reservation of the Department of Energy, for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States.

        (2) __Operation of facility__ 

            Not later than January 1, 2013, the facility designated in paragraph (1) shall be operational and shall accept custody, for the purpose of long-term management and storage, of elemental mercury generated within the United States and delivered to such facility.

    (b) __Fees__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        After consultation with persons who are likely to deliver elemental mercury to a designated facility for long-term management and storage under the program prescribed in subsection (a), and with other interested persons, the Secretary shall assess and collect a fee at the time of delivery for providing such management and storage, based on the pro rata cost of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury delivered to the facility. The amount of such fees—

            (A) shall be made publically  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “publicly”. </sup></sup>  available not later than October 1, 2012;

            (B) may be adjusted annually; and

            (C) shall be set in an amount sufficient to cover the costs described in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Costs__ 

            The costs referred to in paragraph (1)(C) are the costs to the Department of Energy of providing such management and storage, including facility operation and maintenance, security, monitoring, reporting, personnel, administration, inspections, training, fire suppression, closure, and other costs required for compliance with applicable law. Such costs shall not include costs associated with land acquisition or permitting of a designated facility under the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6901][/us/usc/t42/s6901] et seq.\] or other applicable law. Building design and building construction costs shall only be included to the extent that the Secretary finds that the management and storage of elemental mercury accepted under the program under this section cannot be accomplished without construction of a new building or buildings.

    (c) __Report__ 

        Not later than 60 days after the end of each Federal fiscal year, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report on all of the costs incurred in the previous fiscal year associated with the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury. Such report shall set forth separately the costs associated with activities taken under this section.

    (d) __Management standards for a facility__ 

        (1) __Guidance__ 

            Not later than October 1, 2009, the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and all appropriate State agencies in affected States, shall make available, including to potential users of the long-term management and storage program established under subsection (a), guidance that establishes procedures and standards for the receipt, management, and long-term storage of elemental mercury at a designated facility or facilities, including requirements to ensure appropriate use of flasks or other suitable shipping containers. Such procedures and standards shall be protective of human health and the environment and shall ensure that the elemental mercury is stored in a safe, secure, and effective manner. In addition to such procedures and standards, elemental mercury managed and stored under this section at a designated facility shall be subject to the requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6901][/us/usc/t42/s6901] et seq.\], including the requirements of subtitle C of that Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6921][/us/usc/t42/s6921] et seq.\], except as provided in subsection (g)(2) of this section. A designated facility in existence on or before January 1, 2013, is authorized to operate under interim status pursuant to section 3005(e) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6925(e)][/us/usc/t42/s6925/e]\] until a final decision on a permit application is made pursuant to section 3005(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6925(c)][/us/usc/t42/s6925/c]\]. Not later than January 1, 2015, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (or an authorized State) shall issue a final decision on the permit application.

        (2) __Training__ 

            The Secretary shall conduct operational training and emergency training for all staff that have responsibilities related to elemental mercury management, transfer, storage, monitoring, or response.

        (3) __Equipment__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that each designated facility has all equipment necessary for routine operations, emergencies, monitoring, checking inventory, loading, and storing elemental mercury at the facility.

        (4) __Fire detection and suppression systems__ 

        The Secretary shall—

            (A) ensure the installation of fire detection systems at each designated facility, including smoke detectors and heat detectors; and

            (B) ensure the installation of a permanent fire suppression system, unless the Secretary determines that a permanent fire suppression system is not necessary to protect human health and the environment.

    (e) __Indemnification of persons delivering elemental mercury__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall hold harmless, defend, and indemnify in full any person who delivers elemental mercury to a designated facility under the program established under subsection (a) from and against any suit, claim, demand or action, liability, judgment, cost, or other fee arising out of any claim for personal injury or property damage (including death, illness, or loss of or damage to property or economic loss) that results from, or is in any manner predicated upon, the release or threatened release of elemental mercury as a result of acts or omissions occurring after such mercury is delivered to a designated facility described in subsection (a).

            (B) To the extent that a person described in subparagraph (A) contributed to any such release or threatened release, subparagraph (A) shall not apply.

        (2) __Conditions__ 

        No indemnification may be afforded under this subsection unless the person seeking indemnification—

            (A) notifies the Secretary in writing within 30 days after receiving written notice of the claim for which indemnification is sought;

        (3) __Authority of Secretary__ 

            (A) In any case in which the Secretary determines that the Department of Energy may be required to make indemnification payments to a person under this subsection for any suit, claim, demand or action, liability, judgment, cost, or other fee arising out of any claim for personal injury or property damage referred to in paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may settle or defend, on behalf of that person, the claim for personal injury or property damage.

            (B) In any case described in subparagraph (A), if the person to whom the Department of Energy may be required to make indemnification payments does not allow the Secretary to settle or defend the claim, the person may not be afforded indemnification with respect to that claim under this subsection.

    (f) __Terms, conditions, and procedures__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to establish such terms, conditions, and procedures as are necessary to carry out this section.

    (g) __Effect on other law__
