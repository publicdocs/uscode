## § 6939f. Long-term storage

    (a) __Designation of facility__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than January 1, 2010, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) shall designate a facility or facilities of the Department of Energy, which shall not include the Y–12 National Security Complex or any other portion or facility of the Oak Ridge Reservation of the Department of Energy, for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States.

        (2) __Operation of facility__ 

            Not later than January 1, 2019, the facility designated in paragraph (1) shall be operational and shall accept custody, for the purpose of long-term management and storage, of elemental mercury generated within the United States and delivered to such facility.

    (b) __Fees__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Assessment and collection__ 

                After consultation with persons who are likely to deliver elemental mercury to a designated facility for long-term management and storage under the program prescribed in subsection (a), and with other interested persons, the Secretary shall assess and collect a fee at the time of delivery for providing such management and storage, based on the pro rata cost of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury delivered to the facility.

            (B) __Amount__ 

            The amount of the fees described in subparagraph (A)—

                (i) shall be made publicly available not later than October 1, 2018;

                (ii) may be adjusted annually;

                (iii) shall be set in an amount sufficient to cover the costs described in paragraph (2), subject to clause (iv); and

                (iv) for generators temporarily accumulating elemental mercury in a facility subject to subparagraphs (B) and (D)(iv) of subsection (g)(2) if the facility designated in subsection (a) is not operational by January 1, 2019, shall be adjusted to subtract the cost of the temporary accumulation during the period in which the facility designated under subsection (a) is not operational.

            (C) __Conveyance of title and permitting__ 

            If the facility designated in subsection (a) is not operational by January 1, 2020, the Secretary—

                (i) shall immediately accept the conveyance of title to all elemental mercury that has accumulated in facilities in accordance with subsection (g)(2)(D), before January 1, 2020, and deliver the accumulated mercury to the facility designated under subsection (a) on the date on which the facility becomes operational;

                (ii) shall pay any applicable Federal permitting costs, including the costs for permits issued under section 3005(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act ([42 U.S.C. 6925(c)][/us/usc/t42/s6925/c]); and

                (iii) shall store, or pay the cost of storage of, until the time at which a facility designated in subsection (a) is operational, accumulated mercury to which the Secretary has title under this subparagraph in a facility that has been issued a permit under section 3005(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act ([42 U.S.C. 6925(c)][/us/usc/t42/s6925/c]).
