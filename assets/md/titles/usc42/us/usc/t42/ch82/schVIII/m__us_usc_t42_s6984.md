        (2) such contract or assistance meets the requirements of [section 6981 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6981] and meets other applicable requirements of this chapter,

        (3) such facility will be able to comply with the guidelines published under [section 6907 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6907] and with other laws and regulations for the protection of health and the environment,

        (4) in the case of a contract for construction or operation, such facility is not likely to be constructed or operated by State, local, or private persons or in the case of an application for financial assistance, such facility is not likely to receive adequate financial assistance from other sources, and

        (5) any Federal interest in, or assistance to, such facility will be disposed of or terminated, with appropriate compensation, within such period of time as may be necessary to carry out the basic objectives of this chapter.

        (2) The Administrator shall enter into arrangements, wherever practicable and desirable, to provide monitoring of full-scale solid waste facilities (whether or not constructed or operated under this chapter) for purposes of obtaining information concerning the performance, and other aspects, of such facilities.
