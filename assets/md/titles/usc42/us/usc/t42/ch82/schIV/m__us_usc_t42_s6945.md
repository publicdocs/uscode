## § 6945. Upgrading of open dumps

    (a) __Closing or upgrading of existing open dumps__ 

        Upon promulgation of criteria under [section 6907(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6907/a/3], any solid waste management practice or disposal of solid waste or hazardous waste which constitutes the open dumping of solid waste or hazardous waste is prohibited, except in the case of any practice or disposal of solid waste under a timetable or schedule for compliance established under this section. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall be enforceable under [section 6972 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6972] against persons engaged in the act of open dumping. For purposes of complying with section 6943(a)(2) and 6943(a)(3) of this title, each State plan shall contain a requirement that all existing disposal facilities or sites for solid waste in such State which are open dumps listed in the inventory under subsection (b) of this section shall comply with such measures as may be promulgated by the Administrator to eliminate health hazards and minimize potential health hazards. Each such plan shall establish, for any entity which demonstrates that it has considered other public or private alternatives for solid waste management to comply with the prohibition on open dumping and is unable to utilize such alternatives to so comply, a timetable or schedule for compliance for such practice or disposal of solid waste which specifies a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions or operations, leading to compliance with the prohibition on open dumping of solid waste within a reasonable time (not to exceed 5 years from the date of publication of criteria under [section 6907(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6907/a/3]).

    (b) __Inventory__ 

        To assist the States in complying with [section 6943(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6943/a/3], not later than one year after promulgation of regulations under [section 6944 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6944], the Administrator, with the cooperation of the Bureau of the Census shall publish an inventory of all disposal facilities or sites in the United States which are open dumps within the meaning of this chapter.

    (c) __Control of hazardous disposal__ 

        (1)

            (A) Not later than 36 months after November 8, 1984, each State shall adopt and implement a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions to assure that each solid waste management facility within such State which may receive hazardous household waste or hazardous waste due to the provision of [section 6921(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921/d] for small quantity generators (otherwise not subject to the requirement for a permit under [section 6925 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6925]) will comply with the applicable criteria promulgated under section 6944(a) and 6907(a)(3) of this title.

            (B) Not later than eighteen months after the promulgation of revised criteria under subsection  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “section”. </sup></sup>  6944(a) of this title (as required by [section 6949a(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6949a/c]), each State shall adopt and implement a permit program or other system or  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “of”. </sup></sup>  prior approval and conditions, to assure that each solid waste management facility within such State which may receive hazardous household waste or hazardous waste due to the provision of [section 6921(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6921/d] for small quantity generators (otherwise not subject to the requirement for a permit under [section 6925 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6925]) will comply with the criteria revised under [section 6944(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6944/a].

            (C) The Administrator shall determine whether each State has developed an adequate program under this paragraph. The Administrator may make such a determination in conjunction with approval, disapproval or partial approval of a State plan under [section 6947 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6947].

        (2)

            (A) In any State that the Administrator determines has not adopted an adequate program for such facilities under paragraph (1)(B) by the date provided in such paragraph, the Administrator may use the authorities available under sections 6927 and 6928 of this title to enforce the prohibition contained in subsection (a) of this section with respect to such facilities.

            (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “requirement of this subchapter” in [section 6928 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6928] shall be deemed to include criteria promulgated by the Administrator under sections 6907(a)(3) and 6944(a) of this title, and the term “hazardous wastes” in [section 6927 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6927] shall be deemed to include solid waste at facilities that may handle hazardous household wastes or hazardous wastes from small quantity generators.
