        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 180 days after August 10, 2005, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and heads of other Federal agencies, shall establish criteria (including an evaluation of whether to establish a numerical standard for concentration of lead and other hazardous substances) for the safe and environmentally protective use of granular mine tailings from the Tar Creek, Oklahoma Mining District, known as “chat”, for—

            (B) transportation construction projects (including transportation construction projects involving the use of asphalt) that are carried out, in whole or in part, using Federal funds.

        (2) __Requirements__ 

        In establishing criteria under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider—

            (A) the current and previous uses of granular mine tailings as an aggregate for asphalt; and

            (B) any environmental and public health risks and benefits derived from the removal, transportation, and use in transportation projects of granular mine tailings.

        (3) __Public participation__ 

            In establishing the criteria under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall solicit and consider comments from the public.

        (4) __Applicability of criteria__
