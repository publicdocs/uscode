## § 2133. Commercial licenses

    (a) __Conditions__ 

        The Commission is authorized to issue licenses to persons applying therefor to transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, use, import, or export under the terms of an agreement for cooperation arranged pursuant to [section 2153 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2153], utilization or production facilities for industrial or commercial purposes. Such licenses shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of subchapter XV of this division and subject to such conditions as the Commission may by rule or regulation establish to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter.

    (b) __Nonexclusive basis__ 

        The Commission shall issue such licenses on a nonexclusive basis to persons applying therefor (1) whose proposed activities will serve a useful purpose proportionate to the quantities of special nuclear material or source material to be utilized; (2) who are equipped to observe and who agree to observe such safety standards to protect health and to minimize danger to life or property as the Commission may by rule establish; and (3) who agree to make available to the Commission such technical information and data concerning activities under such licenses as the Commission may determine necessary to promote the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public. All such information may be used by the Commission only for the purposes of the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public.

    (c) __License period__ 

        Each such license shall be issued for a specified period, as determined by the Commission, depending on the type of activity to be licensed, but not exceeding forty years from the authorization to commence operations, and may be renewed upon the expiration of such period.

    (d) __Limitations__ 

        No license under this section may be given to any person for activities which are not under or within the jurisdiction of the United States, except for the export of production or utilization facilities under terms of an agreement for cooperation arranged pursuant to [section 2153 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2153], or except under the provisions of [section 2139 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2139]. No license may be issued to an alien or any any  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  corporation or other entity if the Commission knows or has reason to believe it is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government. In any event, no license may be issued to any person within the United States if, in the opinion of the Commission, the issuance of a license to such person would be inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public.

    (f)  __ <sup>\[__  __2__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __2__  __ So in original. Probably should be “(e)”.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Accident notification condition; license revocation; license amendment to include condition__ 

        Each license issued for a utilization facility under this section or [section 2134(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2134/b] shall require as a condition thereof that in case of any accident which could result in an unplanned release of quantities of fission products in excess of allowable limits for normal operation established by the Commission, the licensee shall immediately so notify the Commission. Violation of the condition prescribed by this subsection may, in the Commission’s discretion, constitute grounds for license revocation. In accordance with [section 2237 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2237], the Commission shall promptly amend each license for a utilization facility issued under this section or [section 2134(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2134/b] which is in effect on June 30, 1980, to include the provisions required under this subsection.
