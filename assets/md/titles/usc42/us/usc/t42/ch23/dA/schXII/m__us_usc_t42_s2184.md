## § 2184. Injunctions; measure of damages

    No court shall have jurisdiction or power to stay, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the use of any invention or discovery by a patent licensee, to the extent that such use is licensed by section 2183(b) or 2183(e) of this title. If, in any action against such patent licensee, the court shall determine that the defendant is exercising such license, the measure of damages shall be the royalty fee determined pursuant to [section 2187(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2187/c], together with such costs, interest, and reasonable attorney’s fees as may be fixed by the court. If no royalty fee has been determined, the court shall stay the proceeding until the royalty fee is determined pursuant to [section 2187(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2187/c]. If any such patent licensee shall fail to pay such royalty fee, the patentee may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such royalty fee, together with such costs, interest, and reasonable attorney’s fees as may be fixed by the court.
