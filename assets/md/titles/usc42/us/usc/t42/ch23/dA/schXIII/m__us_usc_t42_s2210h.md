    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Code of conduct__ 

            The term “Code of Conduct” means the code entitled the “Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources”, approved by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and dated September 8, 2003.

        (2) __Radiation source__ 

        The term “radiation source” means—

            (A) a Category 1 Source or a Category 2 Source, as defined in the Code of Conduct; and

            (B) any other material that poses a threat such that the material is subject to this section, as determined by the Commission, by regulation, other than spent nuclear fuel and special nuclear materials.

    (b) __Commission approval__ 

    Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Commission shall issue regulations prohibiting a person from—

        (1)

         exporting a radiation source, unless the Commission has specifically determined under section 2077 or 2112 of this title, consistent with the Code of Conduct, with respect to the exportation, that—

            (A) the recipient of the radiation source may receive and possess the radiation source under the laws and regulations of the country of the recipient;

            (B) the recipient country has the appropriate technical and administrative capability, resources, and regulatory structure to ensure that the radiation source will be managed in a safe and secure manner; and

            (C)

             before the date on which the radiation source is shipped—

                (i) a notification has been provided to the recipient country; and

                (ii) a notification has been received from the recipient country;

                as the Commission determines to be appropriate;

        (2)

         importing a radiation source, unless the Commission has determined, with respect to the importation, that—

            (A) the proposed recipient is authorized by law to receive the radiation source; and

            (B) the shipment will be made in accordance with any applicable Federal or State law or regulation; and

        (3)

         selling or otherwise transferring ownership of a radiation source, unless the Commission—

            (A) has determined that the licensee has verified that the proposed recipient is authorized under law to receive the radiation source; and

    (c) __Tracking system__ 

        (1)

            (A) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, the Commission shall issue regulations establishing a mandatory tracking system for radiation sources in the United States.

            (B) In establishing the tracking system under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall coordinate with the Secretary of Transportation to ensure compatibility, to the maximum extent practicable, between the tracking system and any system established by the Secretary of Transportation to track the shipment of radiation sources.

        (2)

         The tracking system under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) enable the identification of each radiation source by serial number or other unique identifier;

            (B) require reporting within 7 days of any change of possession of a radiation source;

            (C) require reporting within 24 hours of any loss of control of, or accountability for, a radiation source; and

            (D) provide for reporting under subparagraphs (B) and (C) through a secure Internet connection.

    (d) __Penalty__ 

        A violation of a regulation issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000,000.

    (e) __National Academy of Sciences study__ 

        (1) Not later than 60 days after August 8, 2005, the Commission shall enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences under which the National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study of industrial, research, and commercial uses for radiation sources.

        (2)

         The study under paragraph (1) shall include a review of uses of radiation sources in existence on the date on which the study is conducted, including an identification of any industrial or other process that—

            (A) uses a radiation source that could be replaced with an economically and technically equivalent (or improved) process that does not require the use of a radiation source; or

            (B) may be used with a radiation source that would pose a lower risk to public health and safety in the event of an accident or attack involving the radiation source.

        (3) Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Commission shall submit to Congress the results of the study under paragraph (1).

    (f) __Task force on radiation source protection and security__ 

        (1) There is established a task force on radiation source protection and security (referred to in this section as the “task force”).

        (2)

            (A) The chairperson of the task force shall be the Chairperson of the Commission (or a designee).
