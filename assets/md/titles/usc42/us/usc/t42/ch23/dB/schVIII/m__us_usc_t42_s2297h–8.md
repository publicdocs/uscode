    (a) __Contractor employees__ 

        (1) Privatization shall not diminish the accrued, vested pension benefits of employees of the Corporation’s operating contractor at the two gaseous diffusion plants.

        (4)

         If the private corporation replaces its operating contractor at a gaseous diffusion plant, the new employer (including the new contractor or the private corporation if it operates a gaseous diffusion plant without a contractor) shall—

            (A) offer employment to non-management employees of the predecessor contractor to the extent that their jobs still exist or they are qualified for new jobs, and

            (B) abide by the terms of the predecessor contractor’s collective bargaining agreement until the agreement expires or a new agreement is signed.

        (5) In the event of a plant closing or mass layoff (as such terms are defined in section 2101(a)(2) and (3) of title 29) at either of the gaseous diffusion plants, the Secretary of Energy shall treat any adversely affected employee of an operating contractor at either plant who was an employee at such plant on July 1, 1993, as a Department of Energy employee for purposes of sections 3161 and 3162 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 ([42 U.S.C. 7274h–727][/us/usc/t42/s7274h–727]4i). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>

            (B)

             Persons eligible for coverage under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to:

                (i) persons who retired from active employment at one of the gaseous diffusion plants on or before the privatization date as vested participants in a pension plan maintained either by the Corporation’s operating contractor or by a contractor employed prior to July 1, 1993, by the Department of Energy to operate a gaseous diffusion plant; and

                (ii) persons who are employed by the Corporation’s operating contractor on or before the privatization date and are vested participants in a pension plan maintained either by the Corporation’s operating contractor or by a contractor employed prior to July 1, 1993, by the Department of Energy to operate a gaseous diffusion plant.

            (C) The Secretary shall fund the entire cost of post-retirement health benefits for persons who retired from employment with an operating contractor prior to July 1, 1993.

            (D) The Secretary and the Corporation shall fund the cost of post-retirement health benefits for persons who retire from employment with an operating contractor on or after July 1, 1993, in proportion to the retired person’s years and months of service at a gaseous diffusion plant under their respective management.

        (7)

            (A) Any suit under this subsection alleging a violation of an agreement between an employer and a labor organization shall be brought in accordance with section 185 1 of title 29.

            (B) Any charge under this subsection alleging an unfair labor practice violative of section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act ([29 U.S.C. 158][/us/usc/t29/s158]) shall be pursued in accordance with section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act ([29 U.S.C. 160][/us/usc/t29/s160]).

 __References in Text__ 

    The National Labor Relations Act, referred to in subsec.

    2005—Subsec. (a)(8). [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] added par. (8).

    1996—Subsec. (b)(3). [Pub. L. 104–206][/us/pl/104/206] which directed the amendment of subsec. (b) by inserting par. (3), was executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress by substituting par. (3) for former par. (3) which read as follows: “The Corporation shall pay to the Thrift Savings Fund such employee and agency contributions as are required by [section 8432 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8432] for those employees who elect to retain their coverage under FERS pursuant to paragraph (1).”
