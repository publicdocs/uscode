        (1) nuclear processes;

        (2) the theory and production of atomic energy, including processes, materials, and devices related to such production;

        (3) utilization of special nuclear material and radioactive material for medical, biological, agricultural, health, or military purposes;

        (4) utilization of special nuclear material, atomic energy, and radioactive material and processes entailed in the utilization or production of atomic energy or such material for all other purposes, including industrial or commercial uses, the generation of usable energy, and the demonstration of advances in the commercial or industrial application of atomic energy;

        (5) the protection of health and the promotion of safety during research and production activities; and

        (6) the preservation and enhancement of a viable environment by developing more efficient methods to meet the Nation’s energy needs.

    (b) __Grants and contributions__ 

    The Commission is authorized—

        (1) to make grants and contributions to the cost of construction and operation of reactors and other facilities and other equipment to colleges, universities, hospitals, and eleemosynary or charitable institutions for the conduct of educational and training activities relating to the fields in subsection (a) of this section; and
