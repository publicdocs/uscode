        Not later than forty-five days of continuous session of Congress after the date of transmittal to the Congress of any submission of the President required by section 2155(a)(2), 2155(b)(2), 2157(b), 2158, 2160(a)(3), or 2160(f)(1)(A) of this title, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives shall each submit a report to its respective House on its views and recommendations respecting such Presidential submission together with a resolution, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, stating in substance that the Congress approves or disapproves such submission, as the case may be: Provided, That if any such committee has not reported such a resolution at the end of such forty-five day period, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged from further consideration of such submission. If no such resolution has been reported at the end of such period, the first resolution, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, which is introduced within five days thereafter within such House shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of such House.

    (b) __Consideration of resolution by respective Houses of Congress__ 

        When the relevant committee or committees have reported such a resolution (or have been discharged from further consideration of such a resolution pursuant to subsection (a) of this section) or when a resolution has been introduced and placed on the appropriate calendar pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, as the case may be, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall not be subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.

    (c) __Debate__ 

        Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than ten hours, which shall be divided equally between individuals favoring and individuals opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to a motion to postpone, or a motion to recommit the resolution, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. No amendment to any concurrent resolution pursuant to the procedures of this section is in order except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.

    (d) __Vote on final approval__ 

        Immediately following (1) the conclusion of the debate on such concurrent resolution, (2) a single quorum call at the conclusion of debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, and (3) the consideration of an amendment introduced by the Majority Leader or his designee to insert the phrase, “does not” in lieu of the word “does” if the resolution under consideration is a concurrent resolution of approval, the vote on final approval of the resolution shall occur.

    (e) __Appeals from decisions of Chair__ 

        Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to such a resolution shall be decided without debate.

    (f) __Resolution__ 

        For the purposes of subsections (a) through (e) of this section, the term “resolution” means a concurrent resolution of the Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: “That the Congress (does or does not) favor the        transmitted to the Congress by the President on    ,        .”, the blank spaces therein to be appropriately filled, and the affirmative or negative phrase within the parenthetical to be appropriately selected.
