## § 2204a. Fission product contracts

    (a) __Authority to enter into contracts__ 

        Without regard to sections 1341, 1342, and 1349–1351 and subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31, the Commission is authorized to enter into contracts for such periods of time as the Commission may deem necessary or desirable, for the purpose of making available fission products from Commission reactors, with or without charge for commercial application.

    (b) __Cancellation__ 

        Any contract entered into by the Commission pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Commission upon payment of cancellation costs as provided in such contract, and any appropriation presently or hereafter made available to the Commission shall be available for payment of such costs which may arise from termination as the contract may provide.

    (c) __Submission to Energy Committees__ 

        Before the Commission enters into any arrangement or amendment thereto under the authority of this section, the basis for the proposed arrangement or amendment thereto which the Commission proposes to execute (with necessary background and explanatory data) shall be submitted to the Energy Committees (as defined by [section 2014 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2014]), and a period of forty-five days shall elapse while Congress is in session in computing such forty-five days, there shall be excluded the days on which either House is not in session because of adjournment of more than three days: Provided, however, That the Energy Committees, after having received the basis for the proposed arrangement or amendment thereto, may by resolution in writing waive the conditions of, or all or any portion of, such forty-five-day period.

([Pub. L. 88–332, § 107][/us/pl/88/332/s107], June 30, 1964, [78 Stat. 230][/us/stat/78/230]; [Pub. L. 103–437, § 15(h)][/us/pl/103/437/s15/h], Nov. 2, 1994, [108 Stat. 4593][/us/stat/108/4593].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Commission, referred to in text, probably means the Atomic Energy Commission in view of the fact that this section was enacted as part of the act authorizing appropriations for the Atomic Energy Commission.

 __Codification__ 

    In subsec. (a), “sections 1341, 1342, and 1349–1351 and subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31” substituted for “section 3679 of the Revised Statutes, as amended \[[31 U.S.C. 665][/us/usc/t31/s665]\]” on authority of [Pub.
