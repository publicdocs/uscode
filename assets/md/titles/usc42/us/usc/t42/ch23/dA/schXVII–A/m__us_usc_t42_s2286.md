>         “(16) A comparison of the cost, as identified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that would be incurred at a gaseous diffusion plant to comply with regulations issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with the cost that would be incurred by a gaseous diffusion plant if such a plant was considered to be a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility as defined by chapter 21 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 ([42 U.S.C. 2286][/us/usc/t42/s2286] et seq.).

>     “(b)  __Comments on Report__  __.—__
