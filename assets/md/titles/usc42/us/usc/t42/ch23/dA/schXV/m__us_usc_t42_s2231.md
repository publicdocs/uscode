 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [act Aug. 1, 1946, ch. 724][/us/act/1946-08-01/ch724], as added by [act Aug. 30, 1954, ch. 1073, § 1][/us/act/1954-08-30/ch1073/s1], [68 Stat. 919][/us/stat/68/919], known as the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 2011 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2011] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    “Subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5” substituted in text for the first reference to the Administrative Procedure Act on authority of [Pub.

Prior to the enactment of Title 5, the Administrative Procedure Act was classified to sections 1001 to 1011 of Title 5.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Provisions similar to this section were contained in section 1814(a), (c) of this title, prior to the general amendment and renumbering of act Aug. 1, 1946, by act Aug. 30, 1954.
