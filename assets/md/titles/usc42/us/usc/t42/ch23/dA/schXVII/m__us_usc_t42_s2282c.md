        (3) __Flexibility__ 

        In promulgating the regulations under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include flexibility—

            (A) to tailor implementation of such regulations to reflect activities and hazards associated with a particular work environment;

            (B) to take into account special circumstances at a facility that is, or is expected to be, permanently closed and that is expected to be demolished, or title to which is expected to be transferred to another entity for reuse; and

            (C) to achieve national security missions of the Department of Energy in an efficient and timely manner.

        (4) __No effect on health and safety enforcement__ 

            This subsection does not diminish or otherwise affect the enforcement or the application of any other law, regulation, order, or contractual obligation relating to worker health and safety.

    (b) __Civil penalties__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A person (or any subcontractor or supplier of the person) who has entered into an agreement of indemnification under [section 2210(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2210/d] (or any subcontractor or supplier of the person) that violates (or is the employer of a person that violates) any regulation promulgated under subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $70,000 for each such violation.

        (2) __Continuing violations__ 

            If any violation under this subsection is a continuing violation, each day of the violation shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of computing the civil penalty under paragraph (1).

    (c) __Contract penalties__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall include in each contract with a contractor of the Department who has entered into an agreement of indemnification under [section 2210(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2210/d] provisions that provide an appropriate reduction in the fees or amounts paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or contractor employee of any regulation promulgated under subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) __Contents__ 

            The provisions shall specify various degrees of violations and the amount of the reduction attributable to each degree of violation.

    (d) __Coordination of penalties__ 

        (1) __Choice of penalties__ 

            For any violation by a person of a regulation promulgated under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall pursue either civil penalties under subsection (b) of this section or contract penalties under subsection (c) of this section, but not both.

        (2) __Maximum amount__ 

            In the case of an entity described in subsection (d) of [section 2282a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2282a], the total amount of civil penalties under subsection (b) of this section and contract penalties under subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year may not exceed the total amount of fees paid by the Department of Energy to that entity in that fiscal year.

        (3) __Coordination with__  __[__  __section 2282a of this title__  __][/us/usc/t42/s2282a]__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that a contractor of the Department is not penalized both under this section and under [section 2282a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2282a] for the same violation.
