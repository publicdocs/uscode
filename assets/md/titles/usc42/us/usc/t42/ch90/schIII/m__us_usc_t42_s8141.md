## § 8141. Congressional findings

The Congress finds and declares—

    (1) that artistic, cultural, and historic resources, including urban design, constitute an integral part of a suitable living environment for the residents of the Nation’s urban areas, and should be available to all residents of such areas, regardless of income;

    (2) that the development or preservation of such resources is a significant and necessary factor in restoring and maintaining the vitality of the urban environment, and can serve as a catalyst for improving decaying or deteriorated urban communities and expanding economic opportunities, and for creating a sense of community identity, spirit, and pride; and

    (3) that the encouragement and support of local initiatives to develop or preserve such resources, particularly in connection with federally assisted housing or community development activities or in communities with a high proportion of low-income residents, is an appropriate function of the Federal Government.
