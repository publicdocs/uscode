The Corporation shall also apply the provisions of section 5307(a)(1), (b)(1) and (b)(2) of title 5 governing limitations on certain pay as if its employees were Federal employees receiving payments under title 5.

G, title III][/us/pl/108/199/dG/tIII],\[(1), (2)\], Jan. 23, 2004, [118 Stat. 413][/us/stat/118/413]; [Pub. L. 111–117, div. A, title III][/us/pl/111/117/dA/tIII], Dec. 16, 2009, [123 Stat. 3108][/us/stat/123/3108].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Levels II and IV of the Executive Schedule, referred to in subsec. (a), are set out in sections 5313 and 5315, respectively, of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

 __Amendments__ 

    2009—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 111–117][/us/pl/111/117] inserted “, except that the board-appointed officers may be paid salary at a rate not to exceed level II of the Executive Schedule” before period at end of first sentence.

    2004—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 108–199, title III][/us/pl/108/199/tIII], \[(2)\], added second sentence.

    [Pub. L. 108–199, title III][/us/pl/108/199/tIII], \[(1)\], which directed the substitution of “salary” for “compensation”, was executed by making the substitution both places that “compensation” appeared to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    [Pub. L. 108–199, title III][/us/pl/108/199/tIII], \[(1)\], which directed substitution of “rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule” for “highest rate provided for GS–18 of the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332] United States Code”, was executed by making the substitution for “highest rate provided for GS–18 of the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332], United States Code” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
