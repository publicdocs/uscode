## § 2756b. Work colleges

    (a) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this section is to recognize, encourage, and promote the use of comprehensive work-learning-service programs as a valuable educational approach when it is an integral part of the institution’s educational program and a part of a financial plan which decreases reliance on grants and loans.

    (b) __Source and use of funds__ 

        (1) __Source of funds__ 

            In addition to the sums appropriated under subsection (f) of this section, funds allocated to the institution under this part and part E of this title \[[20 U.S.C. 1087aa][/us/usc/t20/s1087aa] et seq.\] may be transferred for use under this section to provide flexibility in strengthening the self-help-through-work element in financial aid packaging.

        (2) __Activities authorized__ 

        From the sums appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, and from the funds available under paragraph (1), eligible institutions may, following approval of an application under subsection (c) of this section by the Secretary—

            (A) support the educational costs of qualified students through self-help payments or credits provided under the work-learning-service program of the institution within the limits of part F of this title \[[20 U.S.C. 1087kk][/us/usc/t20/s1087kk] et seq.\];

            (B) promote the work-learning-service experience as a tool of postsecondary education, financial self-help and community service-learning opportunities;

            (C) carry out activities described in section 2753 or 2756 of this title;

            (D)

             be used for the administration, development and assessment of comprehensive work-learning-service programs, including—

                (i) community-based work-learning-service alternatives that expand opportunities for community service and career-related work; and

                (ii) alternatives that develop sound citizenship, encourage student persistence, and make optimum use of assistance under this part in education and student development;

            (E) coordinate and carry out joint projects and activities to promote work service learning; and

            (F) carry out a comprehensive, longitudinal study of student academic progress and academic and career outcomes, relative to student self-sufficiency in financing their higher education, repayment of student loans, continued community service, kind and quality of service performed, and career choice and community service selected after graduation.

    (c) __Application__ 

        Each eligible institution may submit an application for funds authorized by subsection (f) of this section to use funds under subsection (b)(1) of this section at such time and in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, may reasonably require.

    (d) __Match required__ 

        Funds made available to work-colleges pursuant to this section shall be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis from non-Federal sources.
