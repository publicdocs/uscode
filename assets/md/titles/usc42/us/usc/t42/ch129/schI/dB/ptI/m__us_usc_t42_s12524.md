## § 12524. Allotments

    (a) __Indian tribes and territories__ 

        Of the amounts appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year, the Corporation shall reserve an amount of not less than 2 percent and not more than 3 percent for payments to Indian tribes, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, to be allotted in accordance with their respective needs.

    (b) __Allotments through States__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        After reserving an amount under subsection (a), the Corporation shall use the remainder of the funds appropriated to carry out this part for the fiscal year as follows:

            (A) __Allotments based on school-age youth__ 

                From 50 percent of such remainder, the Corporation shall allot to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of such remainder as the number of school-age youth in the State bears to the total number of school-age youth in all States.

            (B) __Allotments based on allocations under Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965__ 

                From 50 percent of such remainder, the Corporation shall allot to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of such remainder as the allocation to the State for the previous fiscal year under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([20 U.S.C. 6301][/us/usc/t20/s6301] et seq.) bears to the total of such allocations to all States.

        (2) __Minimum amount__ 

            For any fiscal year for which amounts appropriated for this division exceed $50,000,000, the minimum allotment to each State under paragraph (1) shall be $75,000.

    (c) __Reallotment__ 

        If the Corporation determines that the allotment of a State, territory, or Indian tribe under this section will not be required for a fiscal year because the State, territory, or Indian tribe did not submit and receive approval of an application for the allotment under [section 12525 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12525], the Corporation shall make the allotment for such State, territory, or Indian tribe available for grants to community-based entities to carry out service-learning programs as described in [section 12523(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12523/b] in such State, in such territory, or for such Indian tribe. After community-based entities apply for grants from the allotment, by submitting an application at such time and in such manner as the Corporation requires, and receive approval, the remainder of such allotment shall be available for reallotment to such other States, territories, or Indian tribes with approved applications submitted under [section 12525 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12525] as the Corporation may determine to be appropriate.
