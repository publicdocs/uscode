## § 12576. Other special assistance

    (a) __Support for State Commissions__ 

        (1) __Grants authorized__ 

            From amounts appropriated for a fiscal year pursuant to the authorization of appropriation in [section 12681(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12681/a/5], the Corporation may make a grant in an amount between $250,000 and $1,000,000 to a State to assist the State to establish or operate the State Commission on National and Community Service required to be established by the State under [section 12638 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12638].

        (2) __Matching requirement__ 

            In making a grant to a State under this subsection, the Corporation shall require the State to agree to provide matching funds from non-Federal sources of not less than $1 for every $1 provided by the Corporation through the grant.

        (3) __Alternative__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Chief Executive Officer may permit a State that demonstrates hardship or a new State Commission to meet alternative matching requirements for such a grant as follows:

            (A) __First $100,000__ 

                For the first $100,000 of grant funds provided by the Corporation, the State involved shall not be required to provide matching funds.

            (B) __Amounts greater than $100,000__ 

                For grant amounts of more than $100,000 and not more than $250,000 provided by the Corporation, the State shall agree to provide matching funds from non-Federal sources of not less than $1 for every $2 provided by the Corporation, in excess of $100,000.

            (C) __Amounts greater than $250,000__ 

                For grant amounts of more than $250,000 provided by the Corporation, the State shall agree to provide matching funds from non-Federal sources of not less than $1 for every $1 provided by the Corporation, in excess of $250,000.

    (b) __Disaster service__ 

        The Corporation may undertake activities, including activities carried out through part A of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 ([42 U.S.C. 4951][/us/usc/t42/s4951] et seq.), to involve programs that receive assistance under the national service laws in disaster relief efforts, and to support, including through mission assignments under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ([42 U.S.C. 5121][/us/usc/t42/s5121] et seq.), nonprofit organizations and public agencies responding to the needs of communities experiencing disasters.

    (c) __Challenge grants for national service programs__ 

        (1) __Assistance authorized__ 

            The Corporation may make challenge grants under this subsection to programs supported under the national service laws.

        (2) __Selection criteria__ 

        The Corporation shall develop criteria for the selection of recipients of challenge grants under this subsection, so as to make the grants widely available to a variety of programs that—

            (A) are high-quality national service programs; and

            (B) are carried out by entities with demonstrated experience in establishing and implementing projects that provide benefits to participants and communities.

        (3) __Amount of assistance__ 

            A challenge grant under this subsection may provide, for an initial 3-year grant period, not more than $1 of assistance under this subsection for each $1 in cash raised from private sources by the program supported under the national service laws in excess of amounts required to be provided by the program to satisfy matching funds requirements. After an initial 3-year grant period, a grant under this subsection may provide not more than $1 of assistance under this subsection for each $2 in cash raised from private sources by the program in excess of amounts required to be provided by the program to satisfy matching funds requirements. The Corporation may permit the use of local or State funds under this paragraph in lieu of cash raised from private sources if the Corporation determines that such use would be equitable due to a lack of available private funds at the local level. The Corporation shall establish a ceiling on the amount of assistance that may be provided to a national service program under this subsection.
