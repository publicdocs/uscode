    (b) __Grants__ 

        The Corporation shall establish a Nonprofit Capacity Building Program to make grants to intermediary nonprofit organizations to serve as intermediary nonprofit grantees. The Corporation shall make the grants to enable the intermediary nonprofit grantees to pay for the Federal share of the cost of delivering organizational development assistance, including training on best practices, financial planning, grantwriting, and compliance with the applicable tax laws, for small and midsize nonprofit organizations, especially those nonprofit organizations facing resource hardship challenges. Each of the grantees shall match the grant funds by providing a non-Federal share as described in subsection (f).

    (d) __Application__ 

        To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, an intermediary nonprofit organization shall submit an application to the Corporation at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Corporation may require. The intermediary nonprofit organization shall submit in the application information demonstrating that the organization has secured sufficient resources to meet the requirements of subsection (f).

    (e) __Preference and considerations__ 

        (1) __Preference__ 

            In making such grants, the Corporation shall give preference to intermediary nonprofit organizations seeking to become intermediary nonprofit grantees in areas where nonprofit organizations face significant resource hardship challenges.

        (2) __Considerations__ 

        In determining whether to make a grant the Corporation shall consider—

            (A) the number of small and midsize nonprofit organizations that will be served by the grant;

            (B) the degree to which the activities proposed to be provided through the grant will assist a wide number of nonprofit organizations within a State, relative to the proposed amount of the grant; and

            (C) the quality of the organizational development assistance to be delivered by the intermediary nonprofit grantee, including the qualifications of its administrators and representatives, and its record in providing services to small and midsize nonprofit organizations.

    (f) __Federal share__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Federal share of the cost as referenced in subsection (b) shall be 50 percent.

            (B) __Third party contributions__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (ii), an intermediary nonprofit grantee shall provide the non-Federal share of the cost through contributions from third parties. The third parties may include charitable grantmaking entities and grantmaking vehicles within existing organizations, entities of corporate philanthropy, corporations, individual donors, and regional, State, or local government agencies, or other non-Federal sources.

                (ii) __Exception__

                (iii) __Maintenance of effort, prior year third-party funding levels__ 

                    For purposes of maintaining private sector support levels for the activities specified by this program, a non-Federal share that includes donations by third parties shall be composed in a way that does not decrease prior levels of funding from the same third parties granted to the nonprofit intermediary grantee in the preceding year.

    (g) __Reservation__ 

        Of the amount authorized to provide financial assistance under this division, there shall be made available to carry out this section $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014.
