        (2) __Priorities__

            (A) proposed in an application submitted by a State Commission; and

            (B) not one of the types of programs described in paragraph (2),

            if the State Commission provides an adequate explanation of the reasons why it should not be a priority of such State to carry out any of such types of programs in the State.

        (4) __Review panel__ 

        The Corporation shall—

            (A) establish panels of experts for the purpose of securing recommendations on applications submitted under [section 12582 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12582] for more than $250,000 in assistance, or for national service positions that would require more than $250,000 in national service educational awards; and
