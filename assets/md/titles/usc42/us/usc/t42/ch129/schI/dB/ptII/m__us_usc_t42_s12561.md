## § 12561. Higher education innovative programs for community service

    (a) __Purpose__ 

        It is the purpose of this part to expand participation in community service by supporting innovative community service programs through service-learning carried out through institutions of higher education, acting as civic institutions to meet the human, educational, environmental, or public safety needs of neighboring communities.

    (b) __General authority__ 

    The Corporation, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, is authorized to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, institutions of higher education (including a consortium of such institutions), and partnerships comprised of such institutions and of other public or private nonprofit organizations, to pay for the Federal share of the cost of—

        (1)

         enabling such an institution or partnership to create or expand an organized community service program that—

            (A) engenders a sense of social responsibility and commitment to the community in which the institution is located;

            (B) provides projects for participants, who shall be students, faculty, administration, or staff of the institution, or residents of the community; and

            (C) the institution or partnership may coordinate with service-learning curricula being offered in the academic curricula at the institution of higher education or at 1 or more members of the partnership;

        (2) supporting student-initiated and student-designed community service projects through the program;

        (3)

         strengthening the leadership and instructional capacity of institutions of higher education and their faculty, with respect to service-learning, by—

            (A) including service-learning as a key component of the preservice teacher curricula of the institution to strengthen the instructional capacity of teachers to provide service-learning at the elementary and secondary levels;

            (B) including service-learning as a component of other curricula or academic programs (other than education curricula or programs), such as curricula or programs relating to nursing, medicine, criminal justice, or public policy; and

            (C) encouraging the faculty of the institution to use service-learning methods throughout their curriculum;

        (4) facilitating the integration of community service carried out under the program into academic curricula, including integration of clinical programs into the curriculum for students in professional schools, so that students can obtain credit for their community service projects;

        (5) supplementing the funds available to carry out work-study programs under part C of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ([42 U.S.C. 2751][/us/usc/t42/s2751] et seq.) to support service-learning and community service through the community service program;

        (6) strengthening the service infrastructure within institutions of higher education in the United States through the program; and

        (7) providing for the training of teachers, prospective teachers, related education personnel, and community leaders in the skills necessary to develop, supervise, and organize service-learning.

    (c) __Federal, State, and local contributions__ 

        (1) __Federal share__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Federal share of the cost of carrying out a program for which assistance is provided under this part may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the program.

                (i) shall provide for such share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment, or services; and

                (ii) may provide for such share through State sources or local sources, including private funds or donated services.

        (2) __Waiver__ 

            The Chief Executive Officer may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) in whole or in part with respect to any such program for any fiscal year if the Corporation determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to a lack of available financial resources at the local level.

    (d) __Application for grant__ 

        (1) __Submission__ 

            To receive a grant or enter into a contract under this part, an institution or partnership shall prepare and submit to the Corporation, an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information and assurances as the Corporation may reasonably require, and obtain approval of the application.
