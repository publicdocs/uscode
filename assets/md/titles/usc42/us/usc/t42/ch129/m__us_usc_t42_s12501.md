    The Congress finds the following:

        (1) Throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs.

        (2) Americans desire to affirm common responsibilities and shared values, and join together in positive experiences, that transcend race, religion, gender, age, disability, region, income, and education.

        (3) The rising costs of postsecondary education are putting higher education out of reach for an increasing number of citizens.

        (4) Americans of all ages can improve their communities and become better citizens through service to the United States.

        (5) Nonprofit organizations, local governments, States, and the Federal Government are already supporting a wide variety of national service programs that deliver needed services in a cost-effective manner.

        (6) Residents of low-income communities, especially youth and young adults, can be empowered through their service, and can help provide future community leadership.

        (9) expand and strengthen service-learning programs through year-round opportunities, including opportunities during the summer months, to improve the education of children and youth and to maximize the benefits of national and community service, in order to renew the ethic of civic responsibility and the spirit of community for children and youth throughout the United States;

        (10) assist in coordinating and strengthening Federal and other service opportunities, including opportunities for participation in emergency and disaster preparedness, relief, and recovery;

        (11) increase service opportunities for the Nation’s retiring professionals, including such opportunities for those retiring from the science, technical, engineering, and mathematics professions, to improve the education of the Nation’s youth and keep America competitive in the global knowledge economy, and to further utilize the experience, knowledge, and skills of older individuals;

        (12) encourage the continued service of the alumni of the national service programs, including service in times of national need;

        (13) encourage individuals age 55 or older to partake of service opportunities;

        (14) focus national service on the areas of national need such service has the capacity to address, such as improving education, increasing energy conservation, improving the health status of economically disadvantaged individuals, and improving economic opportunity for economically disadvantaged individuals;

        (15) recognize and increase the impact of social entrepreneurs and other nonprofit community organizations in addressing national and local challenges;

        (16) increase public and private investment in nonprofit community organizations that are effectively addressing national and local challenges and encourage such organizations to replicate and expand successful initiatives;

    (ii) National and community service programs should leverage Federal resources to enable the recruitment and effective management of a larger number of volunteers than is currently possible;

    (iii) National and community service programs should increase efforts to expand opportunities for, and strengthen the capacity of, faith-based and other community organizations in building and strengthening an infrastructure to support volunteers that meet community needs;

    (iv) National and community service programs should adopt performance measures to identify those practices that merit replication and further investment, as well as to ensure accountability;

    (v) National and community service programs should, consistent with the principles of Federalism and the constitutional role of the States and Indian tribes, promote innovation, flexibility, and results at all levels of government;

    (vi) National and community service programs based in schools should employ tutors who meet required paraprofessional qualifications, and use such practices and methodologies as are required for supplemental educational services;

    (vii) National and community service programs should foster a lifetime of citizenship and civic engagement among those who serve;

    (viii) National and community service programs should avoid or eliminate practices that displace volunteers who are not supported under the national service laws; and

    (ix) Guidelines for the selection of national and community service programs should recognize the importance of professional corps programs in light of the fundamental principles and policymaking criteria set forth in this order.

    Sec. 4. Management Reforms. (a) The Corporation should implement internal management reforms to strengthen its oversight of national and community service programs through enforcement of performance and compliance standards and other management tools.

 __Expanding National Service Through Partnerships to Advance Government Priorities__ 

    Memorandum of President of the United States, July 15, 2013, 78 F.R. 43747, provided:

    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

    Service has always been integral to the American identity. Our country was built on the belief that all of us, working together, can make this country a better place for all. That spirit remains as strong and integral to our identity today as at our country’s founding.

Since its creation 20 years ago, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) has been the Federal agency charged with leading and expanding national service. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act of 2009 (SAA) expanded CNCS’s authority to create opportunities for more Americans to serve. This landmark, bipartisan legislation focuses national service on six areas: emergency and disaster services; economic opportunity; education; environmental stewardship; healthy futures; and veterans and military families. The SAA provides greater opportunities for CNCS to partner with other executive departments and agencies (agencies) and with the private sector to utilize national service to address these critical areas.

    National service and volunteering can be effective solutions to national challenges and can have positive and lasting impacts that reach beyond the immediate service experience. Americans engaged in national service make an intensive commitment to tackle unmet national and local needs by working through non-profit, faith-based, and community organizations. Service can help Americans gain valuable skills, pursue higher education, and jumpstart their careers, which can provide immediate and long-term benefits to those individuals, as well as the communities in which they serve.

    Americans are ready and willing to serve. Applications from Americans seeking to engage in national service programs far exceed the number of available positions. By creating new partnerships between agencies and CNCS that expand national service opportunities in areas aligned with agency missions, we can utilize the American spirit of service to improve lives and communities, expand economic and educational opportunities, enhance agencies’ capacity to achieve their missions, efficiently use tax dollars, help individuals develop skills that will enable them to prepare for long-term careers, and build a pipeline to employment inside and outside the Federal Government.

Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to expand the positive impact of national service, I hereby direct the following:

    Section 1. Establishing a Task Force on Expanding National Service. There is established a Task Force on Expanding National Service, to be co-chaired by the Chief Executive Officer of CNCS and the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, which shall include representatives from agencies and offices that administer programs and develop policies in areas that include the six focus areas set forth in the SAA. The Task Force shall include representatives from:

    (a) the Department of Defense;

    (b) the Department of Justice;

    (c) the Department of the Interior;

    (d) the Department of Agriculture;

    (e) the Department of Commerce;

    (f) the Department of Labor;

    (g) the Department of Health and Human Services;

    (h) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;

    (i) the Department of Transportation;

    (j) the Department of Energy;

    (k) the Department of Education;

    (l) the Department of Veterans Affairs;

    (m) the Department of Homeland Security;

    (n) the Peace Corps;

    (o) the National Science Foundation;

    (p) the Office of Personnel Management;

    (q) the Environmental Protection Agency;

    (r) the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and

    (s) such other agencies and offices as the co-chairs may designate.

    Sec. 2. Mission and Function of the Task Force. (a) The Task Force shall:

    (i) identify existing, and, if appropriate, recommend new, policies or practices that support the expansion of national service and volunteer opportunities that align with the SAA and agency priorities;

    (ii) make recommendations on the most effective way to coordinate national service and volunteering programs across the Federal Government;

    (iii) identify and develop opportunities for interagency agreements between CNCS and other agencies to support the expansion of national service and volunteering;

    (iv) identify and develop public-private partnerships to support the expansion of national service and volunteering;

    (v) identify and develop strategies to use innovation and technology to facilitate the ability of the public to participate in national service and volunteering activities; and

    (vi) develop a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of national service and volunteering interventions in achieving agency priorities, and aggregate and disseminate the results of that evaluation.

    (b) Within 18 months of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall provide the President with a report on the progress made with respect to the functions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

    Sec. 3. Facilitating National Service and Volunteering Partnerships. (a) Each agency on the Task Force shall:

    (i) within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, consult with CNCS about how existing authorities and CNCS programs can be used to enter into interagency and public-private partnerships that allow for meaningful national service and volunteering opportunities, including participating in AmeriCorps, and help the agency achieve its mission;

    (ii) work with CNCS to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such partnerships; and

    (iii) work with CNCS to identify ways in which the agency’s national service participants and volunteers can develop transferable skills, and also how national service can serve as a pipeline to employment inside and outside the Federal Government.

    (b) Where practicable, agencies may consider entering into interagency agreements with CNCS to share program development and funding responsibilities, as authorized under [42 U.S.C. 12571(b)(1)][/us/usc/t42/s12571/b/1].

    Sec. 4. Recruitment of National Service Participants in the Civilian Career Services. In order to provide national service participants a means to pursue additional opportunities to continue their public service through career civilian service, the Office of Personnel Management shall, within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, issue guidance to agencies on developing and improving Federal recruitment strategies for participants in national service.

    Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

    (i) the authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or

    (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

    (d) The Chief Executive Officer of CNCS is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

                              Barack Obama.
