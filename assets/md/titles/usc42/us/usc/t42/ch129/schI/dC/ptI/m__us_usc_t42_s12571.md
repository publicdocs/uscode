    (a) __Provision of assistance__ 

    Subject to the availability of appropriations for this purpose, the Corporation for National and Community Service may make grants to States, subdivisions of States, territories, Indian tribes, public or private nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education for the purpose of assisting the recipients of the grants—

        (1) to carry out full- or part-time national service programs, including summer programs, described in subsection (a), (b), or (c) of [section 12572 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12572]; and

        (2) to make grants in support of other national service programs described in subsection (a), (b), or (c) of [section 12572 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12572] that are carried out by other entities.

    (b) __Restrictions on agreements with Federal agencies__ 

        (1) __Agreements authorized__ 

            The Corporation may enter into an interagency agreement (other than a grant agreement) with another Federal agency to support a national service program carried out or otherwise supported by the agency. The Corporation, in entering into the interagency agreement may approve positions as approved national service positions for a program carried out or otherwise supported by the agency.

        (2) __Prohibition on grants__ 

            The Corporation may not provide a grant under this section to a Federal agency.

        (3) __Consultation with State Commissions__ 

            A Federal agency carrying out or supporting a national service program shall consult with the State Commissions for those States in which projects will be conducted through that program in order to ensure that the projects do not duplicate projects conducted by State or local national service programs.

        (4) __Support for other national service programs__ 

            A Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under paragraph (1) shall, in an appropriate case, enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with an entity that is carrying out a national service program in a State that is in existence in the State as of the date of the contract or cooperative agreement and is of high quality, in order to support the national service program.

        (5) __Application of requirements__ 

            A requirement under this chapter that applies to an entity receiving assistance under this section (other than a requirement limited to an entity receiving assistance under subsection (a)) shall be considered to apply to a Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under this subsection, even though no Federal agency may receive financial assistance under such an agreement.

    (c) __Provision of approved national service positions__ 

    As part of the provision of assistance under subsection (a), and in providing approved national service positions under subsection (b), the Corporation shall—

        (1) approve the provision of national service educational awards described in division D of this subchapter for the participants who serve in national service programs carried out using such assistance; and

        (2)

         deposit in the National Service Trust established in [section 12601(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12601/a] an amount equal to the product of—

            (A) the value of a national service educational award under [section 12603 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12603]; and

            (B) the total number of approved national service positions to be provided or otherwise approved.

    (d) __Five percent limitation on administrative costs__ 

        (1) __Limitation__ 

        Not more than 5 percent of the amount of assistance provided to the original recipient of a grant or transfer of assistance under subsection (a) for a fiscal year may be used to pay for administrative costs incurred by—

            (A) the recipient of the assistance; and

            (B) national service programs carried out or supported with the assistance.

        (2) __Rules on use__ 

        The Corporation may by rule prescribe the manner and extent to which—

            (A) assistance provided under subsection (a) may be used to cover administrative costs; and

            (B)

             that portion of the assistance available to cover administrative costs should be distributed between—

                (i) the original recipient of the grant or transfer of assistance under such subsection; and

                (ii) national service programs carried out or supported with the assistance.

    (e) __Matching funds requirements__ 

        (1) __Requirements__ 

            Except as provided in [section 12594 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12594], the Corporation share of the cost (including the costs of member living allowances, employment-related taxes, health care coverage, and workers’ compensation and other necessary operation costs) of carrying out a national service program that receives the assistance under subsection (a) of this section, whether the assistance is provided directly or as a subgrant from the original recipient of the assistance, may not exceed 75 percent of such cost.

        (2) __Calculation__ 

        In providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program—

            (A) shall provide for such share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment, or services; and

            (B) may provide for such share through State sources, local sources, or other Federal sources (other than the use of funds made available under the national service laws).

        (3) __Cost of health care__ 

            In providing a payment in cash under paragraph (2)(A) as part of providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program may count not more than 85 percent of the cost of providing a health care policy described in [section 12594(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12594/d/2] toward such share.

        (4) __Waiver__ 

            The Corporation may waive in whole or in part the requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to a national service program in any fiscal year if the Corporation determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to a lack of available financial resources at the local level.

        (5) __Other Federal funds__ 

            (A) __Recipient report__ 

                A recipient of assistance under this section (other than a recipient of assistance through a fixed-amount grant in accordance with section 12581(l) of this title) shall report to the Corporation the amount and source of any Federal funds used to carry out the program for which the assistance is made available other than those provided by the Corporation.

            (B) __Corporation report__ 

                The Corporation shall report to the authorizing committees on an annual basis information regarding each recipient of such assistance that uses Federal funds other than those provided by the Corporation to carry out such a program, including the amounts and sources of the other Federal funds.

    (f) __Plan for approved national service positions__

        (1)

         develop a plan to—

            (A) establish the number of the approved national service positions as 88,000 for fiscal year 2010;
