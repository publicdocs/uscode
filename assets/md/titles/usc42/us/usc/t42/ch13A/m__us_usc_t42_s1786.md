    (c) __Grants-in-aid; cash grants; ratable reduction of amount an agency may distribute; affirmative action; regulations relating to dual receipt of benefits under commodity supplemental food program__ 

        (1)

         The Secretary may carry out a special supplemental nutrition program to assist State agencies through grants-in-aid and other means to provide, through local agencies, at no cost, supplemental foods, nutrition education, and breastfeeding support and promotion to low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children who satisfy the eligibility requirements specified in subsection (d) of this section. The program shall be supplementary to—

            (A) the supplemental nutrition assistance program;

            (B) any program under which foods are distributed to needy families in lieu of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits; and

            (C) receipt of food or meals from soup kitchens, or shelters, or other forms of emergency food assistance.

The Secretary shall take affirmative action to ensure that the program is instituted in areas most in need of supplemental foods. The existence of a commodity supplemental food program under section 4 of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 shall not preclude the approval of an application from an eligible local agency to participate in the program under this section nor the operation of such program within the same geographic area as that of the commodity supplemental food program, but the Secretary shall issue such regulations as are necessary to prevent dual receipt of benefits under the commodity supplemental food program and the program under this section.

        (4) A State shall be ineligible to participate in programs authorized under this section if the Secretary determines that State or local sales taxes are collected within the State on purchases of food made to carry out this section.

    (d) __Eligible participants__ 

        (1) Participation in the program under this section shall be limited to pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children from low-income families who are determined by a competent professional authority to be at nutritional risk.

        (2)

            (A)

             The Secretary shall establish income eligibility standards to be used in conjunction with the nutritional risk criteria in determining eligibility of individuals for participation in the program. Any individual at nutritional risk shall be eligible for the program under this section only if such individual—

                (i) is a member of a family with an income that is less than the maximum income limit prescribed under [section 1758(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1758/b] for free and reduced price meals;

                (ii)

                    (I) receives supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 \[[7 U.S.C. 2011][/us/usc/t7/s2011] et seq.\]; or

                    (II) is a member of a family that receives assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.\] that the Secretary determines complies with standards established by the Secretary that ensure that the standards under the State program are comparable to or more restrictive than those in effect on June 1, 1995; or

                (iii)

                    (I) receives medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.\]; or

                    (II) is a member of a family in which a pregnant woman or an infant receives such assistance.

            (B)

             For the purpose of determining income eligibility under this section, any State agency may choose to exclude from income—

                (i)

                 any basic allowance—

                    (I) for housing received by military service personnel residing off military installations; or

                    (II) provided under [section 403 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s403] for housing that is acquired or constructed under subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10 or any related provision of law; and

                (ii) any cost-of-living allowance provided under [section 475 of title 37][/us/usc/t37/s475] to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the contiguous States of the United States.

            (C) __Combat pay.—__ 

            For the purpose of determining income eligibility under this section, a State agency shall exclude from income any additional payment under chapter 5 of title 37, or otherwise designated by the Secretary to be appropriate for exclusion under this subparagraph, that is received by or from a member of the United States Armed Forces deployed to a designated combat zone, if the additional pay—

                (i) is the result of deployment to or service in a combat zone; and

                (ii) was not received immediately prior to serving in a combat zone.

            (D) In the case of a pregnant woman who is otherwise ineligible for participation in the program because the family of the woman is of insufficient size to meet the income eligibility standards of the program, the pregnant woman shall be considered to have satisfied the income eligibility standards if, by increasing the number of individuals in the family of the woman by 1 individual, the income eligibility standards would be met.

        (3) __Certification.—__ 

            (A) __Procedures.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Subject to clause (ii), a person shall be certified for participation in accordance with general procedures prescribed by the Secretary.

                (ii) __Breastfeeding women.—__ 

                A State may elect to certify a breastfeeding woman for a period of 1 year postpartum or until a woman discontinues breastfeeding, whichever is earlier.

                (iii) __Children.—__ 

                A State may elect to certify participant children for a period of up to 1 year, if the State electing the option provided under this clause ensures that participant children receive required health and nutrition assessments.

            (B) A State may consider pregnant women who meet the income eligibility standards to be presumptively eligible to participate in the program and may certify the women for participation immediately, without delaying certification until an evaluation is made concerning nutritional risk. A nutritional risk evaluation of such a woman shall be completed not later than 60 days after the woman is certified for participation. If it is subsequently determined that the woman does not meet nutritional risk criteria, the certification of the woman shall terminate on the date of the determination.

            (C) __Physical presence.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Except as provided in clause (ii) and subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ([42 U.S.C. 12101][/us/usc/t42/s12101] et seq.) and [section 794 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s794], each individual seeking certification or recertification for participation in the program shall be physically present at each certification or recertification determination in order to determine eligibility under the program.

                (ii) __Waivers.—__ 

                If the agency determines that the requirement of clause (i) would present an unreasonable barrier to participation, a local agency may waive the requirement of clause (i) with respect to—

            (D) __Income documentation.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Except as provided in clause (ii), in order to participate in the program pursuant to clause (i) of paragraph (2)(A), an individual seeking certification or recertification for participation in the program shall provide documentation of family income.

                (ii) __Waivers.—__ 

                A State agency may waive the documentation requirement of clause (i), in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, with respect to—

                    (I) an individual for whom the necessary documentation is not available; or

                    (II) an individual, such as a homeless woman or child, for whom the agency determines the requirement of clause (i) would present an unreasonable barrier to participation.

            (E) __Adjunct documentation.—__ 

            In order to participate in the program pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), an individual seeking certification or recertification for participation in the program shall provide documentation of receipt of assistance described in that clause.

            An individual residing in a remote Indian or Native village or an individual served by an Indian tribal organization and residing on a reservation or pueblo may, under standards established by the Secretary, establish proof of residency under this section by providing to the State agency the mailing address of the individual and the name of the remote Indian or Native village.

    (e) __Nutrition education and drug abuse education__ 

        (1) The State agency shall ensure that nutrition education and drug abuse education is provided to all pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding participants in the program and to parents or caretakers of infant and child participants in the program. The State agency may also provide nutrition education and drug abuse education to pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women and to parents or caretakers of infants and children enrolled at local agencies operating the program under this section who do not participate in the program. A local agency participating in the program shall provide education or educational materials relating to the effects of drug and alcohol use by a pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding woman on the developing child of the woman.

                (ii) __Child and adult care food program.—__ 

                A State agency may allow the local agencies or clinics under the State agency to share nutrition educational materials with institutions participating in the child and adult care food program established under [section 1766 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1766] at no cost to that program, if a written materials sharing agreement exists between the relevant agencies.

        (4)

         The State agency—

            (C)

             The plan shall include—

                (i) a description of the food delivery system of the State agency and the method of enabling participants to receive supplemental foods under the program at any of the authorized retail stores under the program, to be administered in accordance with standards developed by the Secretary, including a description of the State agency’s vendor peer group system, competitive price criteria, and allowable reimbursement levels that demonstrate that the State is in compliance with the cost-containment provisions in subsection (h)(11) of this section;

                (ii) procedures for accepting and processing vendor applications outside of the established timeframes if the State agency determines there will be inadequate access to the program, including in a case in which a previously authorized vendor sells a store under circumstances that do not permit timely notification to the State agency of the change in ownership;

        (4) State agencies shall submit monthly financial reports and participation data to the Secretary.

        (5) State and local agencies operating under the program shall keep such accounts and records, including medical records, as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to determine whether there has been compliance with this section and to determine and evaluate the benefits of the nutritional assistance provided under this section. Such accounts and records shall be available at any reasonable time for inspection and audit by representatives of the Secretary and shall be preserved for such period of time, not in excess of five years, as the Secretary determines necessary.

        (6)

            (B) State agencies may provide for the delivery of vouchers to any participant who is not scheduled for nutrition education and breastfeeding counseling or a recertification interview through means, such as mailing, that do not require the participant to travel to the local agency to obtain vouchers. The State agency shall describe any plans for issuance of vouchers by mail in its plan submitted under paragraph (1). The Secretary may disapprove a State plan with respect to the issuance of vouchers by mail in any specified jurisdiction or part of a jurisdiction within a State only if the Secretary finds that such issuance would pose a significant threat to the integrity of the program under this section in such jurisdiction or part of a jurisdiction.

        (7)

            (A) The State agency shall, in cooperation with participating local agencies, publicly announce and distribute information on the availability of program benefits (including the eligibility criteria for participation and the location of local agencies operating the program) to offices and organizations that deal with significant numbers of potentially eligible individuals (including health and medical organizations, hospitals and clinics, welfare and unemployment offices, social service agencies, farmworker organizations, Indian tribal organizations, organizations and agencies serving homeless individuals and shelters for victims of domestic violence, and religious and community organizations in low income areas).

            (B) The information shall be publicly announced by the State agency and by local agencies at least annually.

            (C) The State agency and local agencies shall distribute the information in a manner designed to provide the information to potentially eligible individuals who are most in need of the benefits, including pregnant women in the early months of pregnancy.

            (D)

             Each local agency operating the program within a hospital and each local agency operating the program that has a cooperative arrangement with a hospital shall—

            (B) Any State agency that must suspend or terminate benefits to any participant during the participant’s certification period due to a shortage of funds for the program shall first issue a notice to such participant.

        (9) If an individual certified as eligible for participation in the program under this section in one area moves to another area in which the program is operating, that individual’s certification of eligibility shall remain valid for the period for which the individual was originally certified.

        (10) The Secretary shall establish standards for the proper, efficient, and effective administration of the program. If the Secretary determines that a State agency has failed without good cause to administer the program in a manner consistent with this section or to implement the approved plan of operation and administration under this subsection, the Secretary may withhold such amounts of the State agency’s funds for nutrition services and administration as the Secretary deems appropriate. Upon correction of such failure during a fiscal year by a State agency, any funds so withheld for such fiscal year shall be provided the State agency.

        (11) __Supplemental foods.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the supplemental foods to be made available in the program under this section.

            (B) __Appropriate content.—__ 

            To the degree possible, the Secretary shall assure that the fat, sugar, and salt content of the prescribed foods is appropriate.

            (C) __Review of available supplemental foods.—__ 

            As frequently as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to reflect the most recent scientific knowledge, but not less than every 10 years, the Secretary shall—

                (i) conduct a scientific review of the supplemental foods available under the program; and

                (ii) amend the supplemental foods available, as necessary, to reflect nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns.

        (12) A competent professional authority shall be responsible for prescribing the appropriate supplemental foods, taking into account medical and nutritional conditions and cultural eating patterns, and, in the case of homeless individuals, the special needs and problems of such individuals.

        (13) The State agency may (A) provide nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion, and drug abuse education materials and instruction in languages other than English and (B) use appropriate foreign language materials in the administration of the program, in areas in which a substantial number of low-income households speak a language other than English.

        (14) If a State agency determines that a member of a family has received an overissuance of food benefits under the program authorized by this section as the result of such member intentionally making a false or misleading statement or intentionally misrepresenting, concealing, or withholding facts, the State agency shall recover, in cash, from such member an amount that the State agency determines is equal to the value of the overissued food benefits, unless the State agency determines that the recovery of the benefits would not be cost effective.

        (15)

         To be eligible to participate in the program authorized by this section, a manufacturer of infant formula that supplies formula for the program shall—

            (A) register with the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\]; and

            (B) before bidding for a State contract to supply infant formula for the program, certify with the State health department that the formula complies with such Act and regulations issued pursuant to such Act.

        (17) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section, not later than July 1 of each year, a State agency may implement income eligibility guidelines under this section concurrently with the implementation of income eligibility guidelines under the medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.).

        (18) Each local agency participating in the program under this section may provide information about other potential sources of food assistance in the local area to individuals who apply in person to participate in the program under this section, but who cannot be served because the program is operating at capacity in the local area.

        (19)

         The State agency shall adopt policies that—

            (A) require each local agency to attempt to contact each pregnant woman who misses an appointment to apply for participation in the program under this section, in order to reschedule the appointment, unless the phone number and the address of the woman are unavailable to such local agency; and

            (B) in the case of local agencies that do not routinely schedule appointments for individuals seeking to apply or be recertified for participation in the program under this section, require each such local agency to schedule appointments for each employed individual seeking to apply or be recertified for participation in such program so as to minimize the time each such individual is absent from the workplace due to such application or request for recertification.

        (20) Each State agency shall conduct monitoring reviews of each local agency at least biennially.

        (21) __Use of claims from local agencies, vendors, and participants.—__ 

        A State agency may use funds recovered from local agencies, vendors, and participants, as a result of a claim arising under the program, to carry out the program during—

            (A) the fiscal year in which the claim arises;

            (B) the fiscal year in which the funds are collected; and

            (C) the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds are collected.

        (22)

         The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall carry out an initiative to assure that, in a case in which a State medicaid program uses coordinated care providers under a contract entered into under section 1903(m), or a waiver granted under section 1915(b), of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1396b(m)][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/m] or 1396n(b)), coordination between the program authorized by this section and the medicaid program is continued, including—

        A State agency may round up to the next whole can of infant formula to allow all participants under the program to receive the full-authorized nutritional benefit specified by regulation.

        (26) __Notification of violations.—__ 

        If a State agency finds that a vendor has committed a violation that requires a pattern of occurrences in order to impose a penalty or sanction, the State agency shall notify the vendor of the initial violation in writing prior to documentation of another violation, unless the State agency determines that notifying the vendor would compromise an investigation.

    (g) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

            (A) __Authorization.—__ 

            There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as are necessary for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2015.

    (h) __Funds for nutrition services and administration__ 

        (1)

            (A) Each fiscal year, the Secretary shall make available, from amounts appropriated for such fiscal year under subsection (g)(1) of this section and amounts remaining from amounts appropriated under such subsection for the preceding fiscal year, an amount sufficient to guarantee a national average per participant grant to be allocated among State agencies for costs of nutrition services and administration incurred by State and local agencies for such year.

            (B)

                (i) The amount of the national average per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for any fiscal year shall be an amount equal to the amount of the national average per participant grant for nutrition services and administration issued for the preceding fiscal year, as adjusted.

                (ii)

                 Such adjustment, for any fiscal year, shall be made by revising the national average per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for the preceding fiscal year to reflect the percentage change between—

                    (I) the value of the index for State and local government purchases, as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce, for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the second preceding fiscal year; and

                    (II) the best estimate that is available as of the start of the fiscal year of the value of such index for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the previous fiscal year.

                (ii) __Breast pumps.—__ 

                A State agency may use amounts made available under clause (i) for the purchase of breast pumps.

        (2)

            (A)

             The Secretary shall allocate to each State agency from the amount described in paragraph (1)(A) an amount for costs of nutrition services and administration on the basis of a formula prescribed by the Secretary. Such formula—

                (i)

                 shall be designed to take into account—

                    (I) the varying needs of each State;

                    (II) the number of individuals participating in each State; and

                    (III) other factors which serve to promote the proper, efficient, and effective administration of the program under this section;

                (ii)

                 shall provide for each State agency—

                    (I) an estimate of the number of participants for the fiscal year involved; and

                    (II) a per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for such year;

                (iii) shall provide for a minimum grant amount for State agencies; and

                (iv) may provide funds to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition.

            (B)

                (i) Except as provided in clause (ii) and subparagraph (C), in any fiscal year, the total amount allocated to a State agency for costs of nutrition services and administration under the formula prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall constitute the State agency’s operational level for such costs for such year even if the number of participants in the program at such agency is lower than the estimate provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).

                (ii) If a State agency’s per participant expenditure for nutrition services and administration is more than 10 percent (except that the Secretary may establish a higher percentage for State agencies that are small) higher than its per participant grant for nutrition services and administration without good cause, the Secretary may reduce such State agency’s operational level for costs of nutrition services and administration.

            (C) In any fiscal year, the Secretary may reallocate amounts provided to State agencies under subparagraph (A) for such fiscal year. When reallocating amounts under the preceding sentence, the Secretary may provide additional amounts to, or recover amounts from, any State agency.

        (3)

            (A)

             Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), in each fiscal year, each State agency shall expend—

                (i)

                 for nutrition education activities and breastfeeding promotion and support activities, an aggregate amount that is not less than the sum of—

                    (I) ⅙ of the amounts expended by the State for costs of nutrition services and administration; and

                    (II) except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (F) and (G), an amount equal to a proportionate share of the national minimum breastfeeding promotion expenditure, as described in subparagraph (E), with each State’s share determined on the basis of the number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women in the program in the State as a percentage of the number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women in the program in all States; and

                (ii) for breastfeeding promotion and support activities an amount that is not less than the amount determined for such State under clause (i)(II).

            (B)

             The Secretary may authorize a State agency to expend an amount less than the amount described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for purposes of breastfeeding promotion and support activities if—

                (i) the State agency so requests; and

                (ii) the request is accompanied by documentation that other funds will be used to conduct nutrition education activities at a level commensurate with the level at which such activities would be conducted if the amount described in subparagraph (A)(ii) were expended for such activities.

            (C)

             The Secretary may authorize a State agency to expend for purposes of nutrition education an amount that is less than the difference between the aggregate amount described in subparagraph (A) and the amount expended by the State for breastfeeding promotion and support programs if—

                (i) the State agency so requests; and

                (ii) the request is accompanied by documentation that other funds will be used to conduct such activities.

            (D) The Secretary shall limit to a minimal level any documentation required under this paragraph.

            (E)

             For each fiscal year, the national minimum breastfeeding promotion expenditure means an amount that is—

                (i) equal to $21 multiplied by the number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women participating in the program nationwide, based on the average number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women so participating during the last 3 months for which the Secretary has final data; and

                (ii) adjusted for inflation on October 1, 1996, and each October 1 thereafter, in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)(ii).

        (5)

            (A)

             Subject to subparagraph (B), in any fiscal year that a State agency submits a plan to reduce average food costs per participant and to increase participation above the level estimated for the State agency, the State agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, convert amounts allocated for food benefits for such fiscal year for costs of nutrition services and administration to the extent that such conversion is necessary—

                (i) to cover allowable expenditures in such fiscal year; and

                (ii) to ensure that the State agency maintains the level established for the per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for such fiscal year.

            (B) If a State agency increases its participation level through measures that are not in the nutritional interests of participants or not otherwise allowable (such as reducing the quantities of foods provided for reasons not related to nutritional need), the Secretary may refuse to allow the State agency to convert amounts allocated for food benefits to defray costs of nutrition services and administration.

            (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “acceptable measures” includes use of cost containment measures, curtailment of vendor abuse, and breastfeeding promotion activities.

            (D) __Remote indian or native villages.—__ 

            For noncontiguous States containing a significant number of remote Indian or Native villages, a State agency may convert amounts allocated for food benefits for a fiscal year to the costs of nutrition services and administration to the extent that the conversion is necessary to cover expenditures incurred in providing services (including the full cost of air transportation and other transportation) to remote Indian or Native villages and to provide breastfeeding support in remote Indian or Native villages.

        (6)

         In each fiscal year, each State agency shall provide, from the amounts allocated to such agency for such year for costs of nutrition services and administration, an amount to each local agency for its costs of nutrition services and administration. The amount to be provided to each local agency under the preceding sentence shall be determined under allocation standards developed by the State agency in cooperation with the several local agencies, taking into account factors deemed appropriate to further proper, efficient, and effective administration of the program, such as—

            (A) local agency staffing needs;

            (B) density of population;

            (C) number of individuals served; and

            (D) availability of administrative support from other sources.

        (7)

         The State agency may provide in advance to any local agency any amounts for nutrition services and administration deemed necessary for successful commencement or significant expansion of program operations during a reasonable period following approval of—

            (A) a new local agency;

            (B) a new cost containment measure; or

            (C) a significant change in an existing cost containment measure.

        (8)

            (A)

                (i)

                 Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C)(iii), any State that provides for the purchase of foods under the program at retail grocery stores shall, with respect to the procurement of infant formula, use—

                    (I) a competitive bidding system; or

                    (II) any other cost containment measure that yields savings equal to or greater than savings generated by a competitive bidding system when such savings are determined by comparing the amounts of savings that would be provided over the full term of contracts offered in response to a single invitation to submit both competitive bids and bids for other cost containment systems for the sale of infant formula.

                (ii)

                 In determining whether a cost containment measure other than competitive bidding yields equal or greater savings, the State, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, may take into account other cost factors (in addition to rebate levels and procedures for adjusting rebate levels when wholesale price levels change), such as—

                    (I) the number of infants who would not be expected to receive the primary contract infant formula under a competitive bidding system;

                    (II) the number of cans of infant formula for which no rebate would be provided under another rebate system; and

                    (III) differences in administrative costs relating to the implementation of the various cost containment systems (such as costs of converting a computer system for the purpose of operating a cost containment system and costs of preparing participants for conversion to a new or alternate cost containment system).

                (iii) __Competitive bidding system.—__ 

                A State agency using a competitive bidding system for infant formula shall award contracts to bidders offering the lowest net price for a specific infant formula for which manufacturers submit a bid unless the State agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the weighted average retail price for different brands of infant formula in the State does not vary by more than 5 percent.

                (iv) __Size of state alliances.—__ 

                    (I) __In general.—__ 

                    Except as provided in subclauses (II) through (IV), no State alliance may exist among States if the total number of infants served by States participating in the alliance as of October 1, 2003, or such subsequent date determined by the Secretary for which data is available, would exceed 100,000.

                    (II) __Addition of infant participants.—__ 

                    In the case of a State alliance that exists on June 30, 2004, the alliance may continue and may expand to serve more than 100,000 infants but, except as provided in subclause (III), may not expand to include any additional State agency.

                    (III) __Addition of small state agencies and indian state agencies.—__ 

                    Except as provided in paragraph (9)(B)(i)(II), any State alliance may expand to include any State agency that served less than 5,000 infant participants as of October 1, 2003, or such subsequent date determined by the Secretary for which data is available, or any Indian State agency, if the State agency or Indian State agency requests to join the State alliance.

                    (IV) __Secretarial waiver.—__ 

                    The Secretary may waive the requirements of this clause not earlier than 30 days after submitting to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a written report that describes the cost-containment and competitive benefits of the proposed waiver.

                (v) __First choice of issuance.—__ 

                The State agency shall use the primary contract infant formula as the first choice of issuance (by formula type), with all other infant formulas issued as an alternative to the primary contract infant formula.

                (vi) __Rebate invoices.—__ 

                Effective beginning October 1, 2004, each State agency shall have a system to ensure that infant formula rebate invoices, under competitive bidding, provide a reasonable estimate or an actual count of the number of units sold to participants in the program under this section.

                (vii) __Separate solicitations.—__ 

                In soliciting bids for infant formula under a competitive bidding system, any State agency, or State alliance, that served under the program a monthly average of more than 100,000 infants during the preceding 12-month period shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures that require that bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula separately.

                (viii) __Cent-for-cent adjustments.—__ 

                A bid solicitation for infant formula under the program shall require the manufacturer to adjust for price changes subsequent to the opening of the bidding process in a manner that requires—

                    (I) a cent-for-cent increase in the rebate amounts if there is an increase in the lowest national wholesale price for a full truckload of the particular infant formula; and

                    (II) a cent-for-cent decrease in the rebate amounts if there is a decrease in the lowest national wholesale price for a full truckload of the particular infant formula.

                (ix) __List of infant formula wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and manufacturers.—__ 

                The State agency shall maintain a list of—

                    (I) infant formula wholesalers, distributors, and retailers licensed in the State in accordance with State law (including regulations); and

                    (II) infant formula manufacturers registered with the Food and Drug Administration that provide infant formula.

                (x) __Purchase requirement.—__ 

                A vendor authorized to participate in the program under this section shall only purchase infant formula from the list described in clause (ix).

            (B)

                (i)

                 The Secretary shall waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) in the case of any State that demonstrates to the Secretary that—

                    (I) compliance with subparagraph (A) would be inconsistent with efficient or effective operation of the program operated by such State under this section; or

                    (II) the amount by which the savings yielded by an alternative cost containment system would be less than the savings yielded by a competitive bidding system is sufficiently minimal that the difference is not significant.

                (ii) The Secretary shall prescribe criteria under which a waiver may be granted pursuant to clause (i).

                (iii) The Secretary shall provide information on a timely basis to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on waivers that have been granted under clause (i).

            (C)

                (i) The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to small Indian State agencies carrying out this paragraph in order to assist such agencies to achieve the maximum cost containment savings feasible.

                (ii) The Secretary shall also provide technical assistance, on request, to State agencies that desire to consider a cost containment system that covers more than 1 State agency.

                (iii) The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) in the case of any Indian State agency that has not more than 1,000 participants.

            (D) No State may enter into a cost containment contract (in this subparagraph referred to as the “original contract”) that prescribes conditions that would void, reduce the savings under, or otherwise limit the original contract if the State solicited or secured bids for, or entered into, a subsequent cost containment contract to take effect after the expiration of the original contract.

            (E) The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months. Each such bid solicitation shall only take place if two or more State agencies request the Secretary to perform the solicitation. For such State agencies, the Secretary shall solicit bids and select the winning bidder for a cost containment contract to be entered into by State agencies and infant formula manufacturers or suppliers.

            (F) In soliciting bids for contracts for infant formula for the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures in which bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula, separately, except where the Secretary determines that such solicitation procedures are not in the best interest of the program.

            (G) To reduce the costs of any supplemental foods, the Secretary may make available additional funds to State agencies out of the funds otherwise available under paragraph (1)(A) for nutrition services and administration in an amount not exceeding one half of 1 percent of the amounts to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition.

            (H)

                (i) Any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that submits a bid to supply infant formula to carry out the program authorized by this section and announces or otherwise discloses the amount of the bid, or the rebate or discount practices of such entities, in advance of the time the bids are opened by the Secretary or the State agency, or any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that makes a statement (prior to the opening of bids) relating to levels of rebates or discounts, for the purpose of influencing a bid submitted by any other person, shall be ineligible to submit bids to supply infant formula to the program for the bidding in progress for up to 2 years from the date the bids are opened and shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000,000, as determined by the Secretary to provide restitution to the program for harm done to the program. The Secretary shall issue regulations providing such person, company, corporation, or other legal entity appropriate notice, and an opportunity to be heard and to respond to charges.

                (ii) The Secretary shall determine the length of the disqualification, and the amount of the civil penalty referred to in clause (i) based on such factors as the Secretary by regulation determines appropriate.

                (iii) Any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity disqualified under clause (i) shall remain obligated to perform any requirements under any contract to supply infant formula existing at the time of the disqualification and until each such contract expires by its terms.

            (I) Not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.

            (J) A State shall not incur any interest liability to the Federal Government on rebate funds for infant formula and other foods if all interest earned by the State on the funds is used for program purposes.

            (K) __Reporting.—__ 

            Effective beginning October 1, 2011, each State agency shall report rebate payments received from manufacturers in the month in which the payments are received, rather than in the month in which the payments were earned.

        (9) __Cost containment measure.—__ 

            (A) __Definition of cost containment measure.—__ 

            In this subsection, the term “cost containment measure” means a competitive bidding, rebate, direct distribution, or home delivery system implemented by a State agency as described in the approved State plan of operation and administration of the State agency.

            (B) __Solicitation and rebate billing requirements.—__ 

            Any State agency instituting a cost containment measure for any authorized food, including infant formula, shall—

                (i)

                 in the bid solicitation—

                    (I) identify the composition of State alliances for the purposes of a cost containment measure; and

                    (II) verify that no additional States shall be added to the State alliance between the date of the bid solicitation and the end of the contract;

                (ii) have a system to ensure that rebate invoices under competitive bidding provide a reasonable estimate or an actual count of the number of units sold to participants in the program under this section;

            (C) __Allowable reimbursement levels.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                The State agency shall establish allowable reimbursement levels for supplemental foods for each vendor peer group that ensure—

                    (I) that payments to vendors in the vendor peer group reflect competitive retail prices; and

                    (II) that the State agency does not reimburse a vendor for supplemental foods at a level that would make the vendor ineligible for authorization under the criteria established under subparagraph (B).

                (ii) __Price fluctuations.—__ 

                The allowable reimbursement levels may include a factor to reflect fluctuations in wholesale prices.

                (iii) __Participant access.—__ 

                In establishing allowable reimbursement levels, the State agency shall consider participant access in a geographic area.

            (D) __Exemptions.—__
