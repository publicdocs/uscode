Such plans shall include at a minimum—

        (1) an assessment of those Government actions required to achieve a two-hundred- to four-hundred-megawatt electrical-commercial demonstration of ocean thermal energy conversion systems in time to have industry meet the goal contained in [section 9001(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9001/b/2] including a listing of those financial, property, and patent right packages most likely to lead to early commercial demonstration at minimum cost to the Federal Government;

        (2) an assessment of further Government actions required to permit expansion of the domestic ocean thermal energy conversion industry to meet the goal contained in [section 9001(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9001/b/3];

        (3) an analysis of further Government actions necessary to aid the industry in minimizing and removing any legal and institutional barriers such as the designation of a lead agency; and

        (4) an assessment of the necessary Government actions to assist in eliminating economic uncertainties through financial incentives, such as loan guarantees, price supports, or other inducements.

    (b) __Transmittal of plan to Congress__ 

        The Secretary shall transmit such comprehensive technology application and market development plan to the Congress within three years after July 17, 1980, and update the plan on an annual basis thereafter.

    (c) __Respondent proposals__ 

        As part of the competitive procurement initiative for design and construction of the pilot and demonstration projects authorized in [section 9009(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9009/c], each respondent shall include in its proposal (1) a plan leading to a full-scale, first-of-a-kind facility based on a proposed demonstration system; and (2) the financial and other contributions the respondent will make toward meeting the national goals.
