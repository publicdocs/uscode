## § 2000cc. Protection of land use as religious exercise

    (a) __Substantial burdens__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person, assembly, or institution—

            (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and

            (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

        (2) __Scope of application__ 

        This subsection applies in any case in which—

            (A) the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability;

            (B) the substantial burden affects, or removal of that substantial burden would affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability; or

            (C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations, under which a government makes, or has in place formal or informal procedures or practices that permit the government to make, individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved.

    (b) __Discrimination and exclusion__ 

        (1) __Equal terms__ 

            No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.

        (2) __Nondiscrimination__ 

            No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.

        (3) __Exclusions and limits__ 

        No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that—

            (A) totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction; or

            (B) unreasonably limits religious assemblies, institutions, or structures within a jurisdiction.
