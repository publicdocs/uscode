## § 18042. Federal program to assist establishment and operation of nonprofit, member-run health insurance issuers

    (a) __Establishment of program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a program to carry out the purposes of this section to be known as the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO–OP) program.

        (2) __Purpose__ 

            It is the purpose of the CO–OP program to foster the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to offer qualified health plans in the individual and small group markets in the States in which the issuers are licensed to offer such plans.

    (b) __Loans and grants under the CO–OP program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall provide through the CO–OP program for the awarding to persons applying to become qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers of—

            (A) loans to provide assistance to such person in meeting its start-up costs; and

            (B) grants to provide assistance to such person in meeting any solvency requirements of States in which the person seeks to be licensed to issue qualified health plans.

        (2) __Requirements for awarding loans and grants__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In awarding loans and grants under the CO–OP program, the Secretary shall—

                (i) take into account the recommendations of the advisory board established under paragraph (3);

                (ii) give priority to applicants that will offer qualified health plans on a Statewide basis, will utilize integrated care models, and have significant private support; and

                (iii) ensure that there is sufficient funding to establish at least 1 qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer in each State, except that nothing in this clause shall prohibit the Secretary from funding the establishment of multiple qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers in any State if the funding is sufficient to do so.

            (B) __States without issuers in program__ 

                If no health insurance issuer applies to be a qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer within a State, the Secretary may use amounts appropriated under this section for the awarding of grants to encourage the establishment of a qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer within the State or the expansion of a qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer from another State to the State.

            (C) __Agreement__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall require any person receiving a loan or grant under the CO–OP program to enter into an agreement with the Secretary which requires such person to meet (and to continue to meet)—

                    (I) any requirement under this section for such person to be treated as a qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer; and

                    (II) any requirements contained in the agreement for such person to receive such loan or grant.

                (ii) __Restrictions on use of Federal funds__ 

                The agreement shall include a requirement that no portion of the funds made available by any loan or grant under this section may be used—

                    (I) for carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation; or

                    (II) for marketing.

                 Nothing in this clause shall be construed to allow a person to take any action prohibited by [section 501(c)(29) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/c/29].

                (iii) __Failure to meet requirements__ 

                If the Secretary determines that a person has failed to meet any requirement described in clause (i) or (ii) and has failed to correct such failure within a reasonable period of time of when the person first knows (or reasonably should have known) of such failure, such person shall repay to the Secretary an amount equal to the sum of—

                    (I) 110 percent of the aggregate amount of loans and grants received under this section; plus

                    (II) interest on the aggregate amount of loans and grants received under this section for the period the loans or grants were outstanding.

                 The Secretary shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any determination under this section of a failure that results in the termination of an issuer’s tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(29) of such title.

            (D) __Time for awarding loans and grants__ 

                The Secretary shall not later than July 1, 2013, award the loans and grants under the CO–OP program and begin the distribution of amounts awarded under such loans and grants.

        (3) __Repayment of loans and grants__ 

            Not later than July 1, 2013, and prior to awarding loans and grants under the CO–OP program, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations with respect to the repayment of such loans and grants in a manner that is consistent with State solvency regulations and other similar State laws that may apply. In promulgating such regulations, the Secretary shall provide that such loans shall be repaid within 5 years and such grants shall be repaid within 15 years, taking into consideration any appropriate State reserve requirements, solvency regulations, and requisite surplus note arrangements that must be constructed in a State to provide for such repayment prior to awarding such loans and grants.
