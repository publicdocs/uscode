## § 18014. Treatment of expatriate health plans under ACA

    (a) __In general__ 

    Subject to subsection (b), the provisions of (including any amendment made by) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([Public Law 111–148][/us/pl/111/148]) and of title I and subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ([Public Law 111–152][/us/pl/111/152]) shall not apply with respect to—

        (1) expatriate health plans;

        (2) employers with respect to such plans, solely in their capacity as plan sponsors for such plans; or

        (3) expatriate health insurance issuers with respect to coverage offered by such issuers under such plans.

    (b) __Minimum essential coverage and reporting requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For the purpose of [section 5000A(f) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s5000A/f], and any other section of title 26 that incorporates the definition of minimum essential coverage under such section 5000A(f) by reference:

            (A) An expatriate health plan offered to primary enrollees who are described in subsections (d)(3)(A) and (d)(3)(B) of this section shall be treated as an eligible employer sponsored plan under 5000A(f)(2) of such title.

            (B) An expatriate health plan offered to primary enrollees who are described in subsection (d)(3)(C) of this section shall be treated as a plan in the individual market under section 5000A(f)(1)(C) of such title. This subparagraph shall apply solely for the purposes of sections 36B, 5000A, and 6055 of such title.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to [section 6055 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s6055], or sections 4980H and 6056 of such title in the case of an applicable large employer (as defined in section 4980H of such title), except that statements furnished to individuals may be provided through electronic media and the primary insured shall be deemed to have consented to receive the statements under such sections in electronic form, unless the individual explicitly refuses such consent. Notwithstanding subsection (a), [section 4980I of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s4980I] shall continue to apply with respect to applicable employer-sponsored coverage (as defined in such section) of a qualified expatriate described in subsection (d)(3)(A)(i) who is assigned (rather than transferred) to work in the United States.

    (c) __Qualified expatriates, spouses, and dependents not United States health risk__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of section 9010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([26 U.S.C. 4001][/us/usc/t26/s4001] note prec.), for calendar years after 2015, a qualified expatriate (and any spouse, dependent, or any other individual enrolled in the plan) enrolled in an expatriate health plan shall not be considered a United States health risk.

        (2) __Special rule__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the fee under section 9010 of such Act for each of calendar years 2014 and 2015 with respect to any expatriate health insurance issuer shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to the fee amount determined by the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to such issuer under such section for each such year (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

            (A) the amount of premiums taken into account under such section with respect to such issuer for each such year, less the amount of premiums for expatriate health plans taken into account under such section with respect to such issuer for each such year, bears to

            (B) the amount of premiums taken into account under such section with respect to such issuer for each such year.
