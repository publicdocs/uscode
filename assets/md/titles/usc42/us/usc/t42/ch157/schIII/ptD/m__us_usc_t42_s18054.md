        (1) __In general__ 

            The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (referred to in this section as the “Director”) shall enter into contracts with health insurance issuers (which may include a group of health insurance issuers affiliated either by common ownership and control or by the common use of a nationally licensed service mark), without regard to [section 6101 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s6101] or other statutes requiring competitive bidding, to offer at least 2 multi-State qualified health plans through each Exchange in each State.

            (B) __No additional Federal cost__ 

                A requirement by a State under paragraph (2) that benefits in addition to the essential health benefits required under paragraph (1)(A) be provided to enrollees of a multi-State qualified health plan shall not affect the amount of a premium tax credit provided under [section 36B of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s36B] with respect to such plan.

    (d) __Plans deemed to be certified__ 

        A multi-State qualified health plan that is offered under a contract under subsection (a) shall be deemed to be certified by an Exchange for purposes of [section 18031(d)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18031/d/4/A].
