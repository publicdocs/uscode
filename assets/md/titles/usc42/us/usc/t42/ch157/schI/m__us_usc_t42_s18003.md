## § 18003. Immediate information that allows consumers to identify affordable coverage options

    (a) __Internet portal to affordable coverage options__ 

        (1) __Immediate establishment__ 

            Not later than July 1, 2010, the Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall establish a mechanism, including an Internet website, through which a resident of, or small business in, any State may identify affordable health insurance coverage options in that State.

        (2) __Connecting to affordable coverage__ 

        An Internet website established under paragraph (1) shall, to the extent practicable, provide ways for residents of, and small businesses in, any State to receive information on at least the following coverage options:

            (A)

             Health insurance coverage offered by health insurance issuers, other than coverage that provides reimbursement only for the treatment or mitigation of—

                (i) a single disease or condition; or

                (ii) an unreasonably limited set of diseases or conditions (as determined by the Secretary).

            (B) Medicaid coverage under title XIX of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.\].

            (C) Coverage under title XXI of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1397aa][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa] et seq.\].

            (D) A State health benefits high risk pool, to the extent that such high risk pool is offered in such State; and

            (E) Coverage under a high risk pool under [section 18001 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18001].

            (F) Coverage within the small group market for small businesses and their employees, including reinsurance for early retirees under [section 18002 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18002], tax credits available under [section 45R of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s45R] (as added by section 1421), and other information specifically for small businesses regarding affordable health care options.

    (b) __Enhancing comparative purchasing options__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 60 days after March 23, 2010, the Secretary shall develop a standardized format to be used for the presentation of information relating to the coverage options described in subsection (a)(2). Such format shall, at a minimum, require the inclusion of information on the percentage of total premium revenue expended on nonclinical costs (as reported under [section 300gg–18(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–18/a]), eligibility, availability, premium rates, and cost sharing with respect to such coverage options and be consistent with the standards adopted for the uniform explanation of coverage as provided for in [section 300gg–15 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–15].

        (2) __Use of format__ 

            The Secretary shall utilize the format developed under paragraph (1) in compiling information concerning coverage options on the Internet website established under subsection (a).

    (c) __Authority to contract__ 

        The Secretary may carry out this section through contracts entered into with qualified entities.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Social Security Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(2)(B), (C), is [act Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531][/us/act/1935-08-14/ch531], [49 Stat. 620][/us/stat/49/620]. Titles XIX and XXI of the Act are classified generally to subchapters XIX (§ 1396 et seq.) and XXI (§ 1397aa et seq.), respectively, of chapter 7 of this title.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148], § 10102(b)(1), which directed insertion of “, or small business in,” after “residents of any”, was executed by making the insertion after “resident of” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
