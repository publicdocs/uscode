 __Codification__ 

    “Sections 1341, 1342, and 1349–1351 and subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31” substituted in text for “section 3679 of the Revised Statutes \[[31 U.S.C. 665][/us/usc/t31/s665]\]” on authority of [Pub. L. 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], § 4(b), Sept. 13, 1982, [96 Stat. 1067][/us/stat/96/1067], the first section of which enacted Title 31, Money and Finance.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–106][/us/pl/104/106] substituted “June 30, 1997” for “June 30, 1996” in two places and “July 1, 1997” for “July 1, 1996”.

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–661][/us/pl/99/661], § 3138(a), substituted “Los Alamos School Board shall not extend beyond June 30, 1996” for “Los Alamos School Board shall not extend beyond June 30, 1986” and “New Mexico, shall not extend beyond June 30, 1996” for “New Mexico, shall not extend beyond June 30, 1987”.

    [Pub.

The latter amendment was executed in this section, rather than to section 2393, as the probable intent of Congress.
