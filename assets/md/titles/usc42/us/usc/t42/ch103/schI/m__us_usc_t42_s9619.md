## § 9619. Response action contractors

    (a) __Liability of response action contractors__ 

        (1) __Response action contractors__ 

            A person who is a response action contractor with respect to any release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant from a vessel or facility shall not be liable under this subchapter or under any other Federal law to any person for injuries, costs, damages, expenses, or other liability (including but not limited to claims for indemnification or contribution and claims by third parties for death, personal injury, illness or loss of or damage to property or economic loss) which results from such release or threatened release.

        (2) __Negligence, etc.__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a release that is caused by conduct of the response action contractor which is negligent, grossly negligent, or which constitutes intentional misconduct.

        (3) __Effect on warranties; employer liability__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall affect the liability of any person under any warranty under Federal, State, or common law. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the liability of an employer who is a response action contractor to any employee of such employer under any provision of law, including any provision of any law relating to worker’s compensation.

        (4) __Governmental employees__ 

            A state employee or an employee of a political subdivision who provides services relating to response action while acting within the scope of his authority as a governmental employee shall have the same exemption from liability (subject to the other provisions of this section) as is provided to the response action contractor under this section.

    (b) __Savings provisions__ 

        (1) __Liability of other persons__ 

            The defense provided by [section 9607(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9607/b/3] shall not be available to any potentially responsible party with respect to any costs or damages caused by any act or omission of a response action contractor. Except as provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section and the preceding sentence, nothing in this section shall affect the liability under this chapter or under any other Federal or State law of any person, other than a response action contractor.

        (2) __Burden of plaintiff__ 

            Nothing in this section shall affect the plaintiff’s burden of establishing liability under this subchapter.

    (c) __Indemnification__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The President may agree to hold harmless and indemnify any response action contractor meeting the requirements of this subsection against any liability (including the expenses of litigation or settlement) for negligence arising out of the contractor’s performance in carrying out response action activities under this subchapter, unless such liability was caused by conduct of the contractor which was grossly negligent or which constituted intentional misconduct.

        (2) __Applicability__ 

        This subsection shall apply only with respect to a response action carried out under written agreement with—

            (A) the President;

            (B) any Federal agency;

            (C) a State or political subdivision which has entered into a contract or cooperative agreement in accordance with [section 9604(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604/d/1]; or

            (D) any potentially responsible party carrying out any agreement under [section 9622 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9622] (relating to settlements) or [section 9606 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9606] (relating to abatement).

        (3) __Source of funding__ 

            This subsection shall not be subject to section 1301 or 1341 of title 31 or section 6301(a) and (b) of title 41 or to [section 9662 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9662]. For purposes of [section 9611 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9611], amounts expended pursuant to this subsection for indemnification of any response action contractor (except with respect to federally owned or operated facilities) shall be considered governmental response costs incurred pursuant to [section 9604 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604]. If sufficient funds are unavailable in the Hazardous Substance Superfund established under subchapter A of chapter 98 of title 26 to make payments pursuant to such indemnification or if the Fund is repealed, there are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to make such payments.

        (4) __Requirements__ 

        An indemnification agreement may be provided under this subsection only if the President determines that each of the following requirements are met:

            (A) The liability covered by the indemnification agreement exceeds or is not covered by insurance available, at a fair and reasonable price, to the contractor at the time the contractor enters into the contract to provide response action, and adequate insurance to cover such liability is not generally available at the time the response action contract is entered into.

            (B) The response action contractor has made diligent efforts to obtain insurance coverage from non-Federal sources to cover such liability.

            (C) In the case of a response action contract covering more than one facility, the response action contractor agrees to continue to make such diligent efforts each time the contractor begins work under the contract at a new facility.

        (5) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Liability covered__ 

                Indemnification under this subsection shall apply only to response action contractor liability which results from a release of any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant if such release arises out of response action activities.

            (B) __Deductibles and limits__ 

                An indemnification agreement under this subsection shall include deductibles and shall place limits on the amount of indemnification to be made available.

            (C) __Contracts with potentially responsible parties__ 

                (i) __Decision to indemnify__ 

                    In deciding whether to enter into an indemnification agreement with a response action contractor carrying out a written contract or agreement with any potentially responsible party, the President shall determine an amount which the potentially responsible party is able to indemnify the contractor. The President may enter into such an indemnification agreement only if the President determines that such amount of indemnification is inadequate to cover any reasonable potential liability of the contractor arising out of the contractor’s negligence in performing the contract or agreement with such party. The President shall make the determinations in the preceding sentences (with respect to the amount and the adequacy of the amount) taking into account the total net assets and resources of potentially responsible parties with respect to the facility at the time of such determinations.

                (ii) __Conditions__ 

                    The President may pay a claim under an indemnification agreement referred to in clause (i) for the amount determined under clause (i) only if the contractor has exhausted all administrative, judicial, and common law claims for indemnification against all potentially responsible parties participating in the clean-up of the facility with respect to the liability of the contractor arising out of the contractor’s negligence in performing the contract or agreement with such party. Such indemnification agreement shall require such contractor to pay any deductible established under subparagraph (B) before the contractor may recover any amount from the potentially responsible party or under the indemnification agreement.

            (D) __RCRA facilities__ 

                No owner or operator of a facility regulated under the Solid Waste Disposal Act \[[42 U.S.C. 6901][/us/usc/t42/s6901] et seq.\] may be indemnified under this subsection with respect to such facility.

            (E) __Persons retained or hired__ 

                A person retained or hired by a person described in subsection (e)(2)(B) of this section shall be eligible for indemnification under this subsection only if the President specifically approves of the retaining or hiring of such person.

        (6) __Cost recovery__ 

            For purposes of [section 9607 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9607], amounts expended pursuant to this subsection for indemnification of any person who is a response action contractor with respect to any release or threatened release shall be considered a cost of response incurred by the United States Government with respect to such release.

        (7) __Regulations__ 

            The President shall promulgate regulations for carrying out the provisions of this subsection. Before promulgation of the regulations, the President shall develop guidelines to carry out this section. Development of such guidelines shall include reasonable opportunity for public comment.

        (8) __Study__ 

            The Comptroller General shall conduct a study in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1989, on the application of this subsection, including whether indemnification agreements under this subsection are being used, the number of claims that have been filed under such agreements, and the need for this subsection. The Comptroller General shall report the findings of the study to Congress no later than September 30, 1989.

    (d) __Exception__ 

        The exemption provided under subsection (a) of this section and the authority of the President to offer indemnification under subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to any person covered by the provisions of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of [section 9607(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9607/a] with respect to the release or threatened release concerned if such person would be covered by such provisions even if such person had not carried out any actions referred to in subsection (e) of this section.
