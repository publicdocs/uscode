## § 9626. Indian tribes

    (a) __Treatment generally__ 

        The governing body of an Indian tribe shall be afforded substantially the same treatment as a State with respect to the provisions of [section 9603(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9603/a] (regarding notification of releases), [section 9604(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604/c/2] (regarding consultation on remedial actions), [section 9604(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604/e] (regarding access to information), [section 9604(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604/i] (regarding health authorities) and [section 9605 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9605] (regarding roles and responsibilities under the national contingency plan and submittal of priorities for remedial action, but not including the provision regarding the inclusion of at least one facility per State on the National Priorities List).

    (b) __Community relocation__ 

        Should the President determine that proper remedial action is the permanent relocation of tribal members away from a contaminated site because it is cost effective and necessary to protect their health and welfare, such finding must be concurred in by the affected tribal government before relocation shall occur. The President, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall also assure that all benefits of the relocation program are provided to the affected tribe and that alternative land of equivalent value is available and satisfactory to the tribe. Any lands acquired for relocation of tribal members shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the tribe.

    (c) __Study__ 

        The President shall conduct a survey, in consultation with the Indian tribes, to determine the extent of hazardous waste sites on Indian lands. Such survey shall be included within a report which shall make recommendations on the program needs of tribes under this chapter, with particular emphasis on how tribal participation in the administration of such programs can be maximized. Such report shall be submitted to Congress along with the President’s budget request for fiscal year 1988.

    (d) __Limitation__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no action under this chapter by an Indian tribe shall be barred until the later of the following:

        (1) The applicable period of limitations has expired.

        (2) 2 years after the United States, in its capacity as trustee for the tribe, gives written notice to the governing body of the tribe that it will not present a claim or commence an action on behalf of the tribe or fails to present a claim or commence an action within the time limitations specified in this chapter.
