## § 9628. State response programs

    (a) __Assistance to States__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __States__ 

            The Administrator may award a grant to a State or Indian tribe that—

                (i) has a response program that includes each of the elements, or is taking reasonable steps to include each of the elements, listed in paragraph (2); or

                (ii) is a party to a memorandum of agreement with the Administrator for voluntary response programs.

            (B) __Use of grants by States__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A State or Indian tribe may use a grant under this subsection to establish or enhance the response program of the State or Indian tribe.

                (ii) __Additional uses__ 

                In addition to the uses under clause (i), a State or Indian tribe may use a grant under this subsection to—

                    (I) capitalize a revolving loan fund for brownfield remediation under [section 9604(k)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9604/k/3]; or

                    (II) purchase insurance or develop a risk sharing pool, an indemnity pool, or insurance mechanism to provide financing for response actions under a State response program.

        (2) __Elements__ 

        The elements of a State or Indian tribe response program referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) are the following:

            (A) Timely survey and inventory of brownfield sites in the State.

            (B)

             Oversight and enforcement authorities or other mechanisms, and resources, that are adequate to ensure that—

                (i)

                 a response action will—

                    (I) protect human health and the environment; and

                    (II) be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal and State law; and

                (ii) if the person conducting the response action fails to complete the necessary response activities, including operation and maintenance or long-term monitoring activities, the necessary response activities are completed.

            (C)

             Mechanisms and resources to provide meaningful opportunities for public participation, including—

                (i) public access to documents that the State, Indian tribe, or party conducting the cleanup is relying on or developing in making cleanup decisions or conducting site activities;

                (ii) prior notice and opportunity for comment on proposed cleanup plans and site activities; and

                (iii)

                 a mechanism by which—

                    (I) a person that is or may be affected by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant at a brownfield site located in the community in which the person works or resides may request the conduct of a site assessment; and

                    (II) an appropriate State official shall consider and appropriately respond to a request under subclause (I).

            (D) Mechanisms for approval of a cleanup plan, and a requirement for verification by and certification or similar documentation from the State, an Indian tribe, or a licensed site professional to the person conducting a response action indicating that the response is complete.

        (3) __Funding__ 

            There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.

    (b) __Enforcement in cases of a release subject to State program__ 

        (1) __Enforcement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and subject to subparagraph (C), in the case of an eligible response site at which—

                (i) there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant; and

                (ii) a person is conducting or has completed a response action regarding the specific release that is addressed by the response action that is in compliance with the State program that specifically governs response actions for the protection of public health and the environment,

                the President may not use authority under this chapter to take an administrative or judicial enforcement action under [section 9606(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9606/a] or to take a judicial enforcement action to recover response costs under [section 9607(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9607/a] against the person regarding the specific release that is addressed by the response action.

            (B) __Exceptions__ 

            The President may bring an administrative or judicial enforcement action under this chapter during or after completion of a response action described in subparagraph (A) with respect to a release or threatened release at an eligible response site described in that subparagraph if—

                (i) the State requests that the President provide assistance in the performance of a response action;

                (ii) the Administrator determines that contamination has migrated or will migrate across a State line, resulting in the need for further response action to protect human health or the environment, or the President determines that contamination has migrated or is likely to migrate onto property subject to the jurisdiction, custody, or control of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States and may impact the authorized purposes of the Federal property;

                (iii)

                 after taking into consideration the response activities already taken, the Administrator determines that—

                    (I) a release or threatened release may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment; and

                    (II) additional response actions are likely to be necessary to address, prevent, limit, or mitigate the release or threatened release; or

                (iv) the Administrator, after consultation with the State, determines that information, that on the earlier of the date on which cleanup was approved or completed, was not known by the State, as recorded in documents prepared or relied on in selecting or conducting the cleanup, has been discovered regarding the contamination or conditions at a facility such that the contamination or conditions at the facility present a threat requiring further remediation to protect public health or welfare or the environment. Consultation with the State shall not limit the ability of the Administrator to make this determination.

            (C) __Public record__ 

                The limitations on the authority of the President under subparagraph (A) apply only at sites in States that maintain, update not less than annually, and make available to the public a record of sites, by name and location, at which response actions have been completed in the previous year and are planned to be addressed under the State program that specifically governs response actions for the protection of public health and the environment in the upcoming year. The public record shall identify whether or not the site, on completion of the response action, will be suitable for unrestricted use and, if not, shall identify the institutional controls relied on in the remedy. Each State and tribe receiving financial assistance under subsection (a) of this section shall maintain and make available to the public a record of sites as provided in this paragraph.

            (D) __EPA notification__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of an eligible response site at which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant and for which the Administrator intends to carry out an action that may be barred under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall—

                    (I) notify the State of the action the Administrator intends to take; and

                    (II)

                        (aa) wait 48 hours for a reply from the State under clause (ii); or

                        (bb) if the State fails to reply to the notification or if the Administrator makes a determination under clause (iii), take immediate action under that clause.

                (ii) __State reply__ 

                Not later than 48 hours after a State receives notice from the Administrator under clause (i), the State shall notify the Administrator if—

                    (I) the release at the eligible response site is or has been subject to a cleanup conducted under a State program; and

                    (II) the State is planning to abate the release or threatened release, any actions that are planned.

                (iii) __Immediate Federal action__ 

                    The Administrator may take action immediately after giving notification under clause (i) without waiting for a State reply under clause (ii) if the Administrator determines that one or more exceptions under subparagraph (B) are met.

            (E) __Report to Congress__ 

                Not later than 90 days after the date of initiation of any enforcement action by the President under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (B), the President shall submit to Congress a report describing the basis for the enforcement action, including specific references to the facts demonstrating that enforcement action is permitted under subparagraph (B).

        (2) __Savings provision__ 

            (A) __Costs incurred prior to limitations__ 

                Nothing in paragraph (1) precludes the President from seeking to recover costs incurred prior to January 11, 2002, or during a period in which the limitations of paragraph (1)(A) were not applicable.

            (B) __Effect on agreements between States and EPA__ 

            Nothing in paragraph (1)—

                (i) modifies or otherwise affects a memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any similar agreement relating to this chapter between a State agency or an Indian tribe and the Administrator that is in effect on or before January 11, 2002 (which agreement shall remain in effect, subject to the terms of the agreement); or

                (ii) limits the discretionary authority of the President to enter into or modify an agreement with a State, an Indian tribe, or any other person relating to the implementation by the President of statutory authorities.

        (3) __Effective date__ 

            This subsection applies only to response actions conducted after February 15, 2001.

    (c) __Effect on Federal laws__ 

    Nothing in this section affects any liability or response authority under any Federal law, including—

        (1) this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section;

        (2) the Solid Waste Disposal Act ([42 U.S.C. 6901][/us/usc/t42/s6901] et seq.);

        (3) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ([33 U.S.C. 1251][/us/usc/t33/s1251] et seq.);
