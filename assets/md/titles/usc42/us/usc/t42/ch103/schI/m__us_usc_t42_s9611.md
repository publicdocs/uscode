    Subsec. (c)(11). [Pub. L. 101–508, § 6301(2)][/us/pl/101/508/s6301/2], substituted “8-fiscal year period” for “5-fiscal-year period”.

    Subsec. (c)(12). [Pub. L. 101–508, § 6301(3)][/us/pl/101/508/s6301/3], substituted “1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994” for “and 1991”.

    Subsec. (n)(2)(E). [Pub. L. 101–508, § 6301(6)][/us/pl/101/508/s6301/6], added subpar. (E) and struck out former subpar. (E) which read as follows: “For the fiscal year 1991, $35,000,000.”

L. 99–499][/us/pl/99/499], does not contain a section 9611, but [section 111(d)(2) of Pub. L. 99–499][/us/pl/99/499/s111/d/2] enacted subsec. (c)(12) of this section.

(2), substituted “The” for “the”, inserted “or Indian tribe” and substituted a period for the semicolon at end, in par.

    Subsec. (e)(3). [Pub. L. 99–499, § 111(f)][/us/pl/99/499/s111/f], inserted before the period at end “; except that money in the Fund shall be available for the provision of alternative water supplies (including the reimbursement of costs incurred by a municipality) in any case involving groundwater contamination outside the boundaries of a federally owned facility in which the federally owned facility is not the only potentially responsible party”.

    Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 99–499, § 207(d)(3)][/us/pl/99/499/s207/d/3], inserted “or Indian tribe”.

    Subsec. (h). [Pub. L. 99–499, § 111(c)(2)][/us/pl/99/499/s111/c/2], struck out subsec. (h) which read as follows:
