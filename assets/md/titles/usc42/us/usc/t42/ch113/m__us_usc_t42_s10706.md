## § 10706. Limitations on grants and contracts

    (a) __Duties of Institute__ 

    With respect to grants made and contracts or cooperative agreements entered into under this chapter, the Institute shall—

        (1)

         ensure that no funds made available to recipients by the Institute shall be used at any time, directly or indirectly, to influence the issuance, amendment, or revocation of any Executive order or similar promulgation by any Federal, State, or local agency, or to undertake to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation or constitutional amendment by the Congress of the United States, or by any State or local legislative body, or any State proposal by initiative petition, or of any referendum, unless a governmental agency, legislative body, a committee, or a member thereof—

            (A) requests personnel of the recipients to testify, draft, or review measures or to make representations to such agency, body, committee, or member; or

            (B) is considering a measure directly affecting the activities under this chapter of the recipient or the Institute; and

        (2) ensure all personnel engaged in grant, cooperative agreement or contract assistance activities supported in whole or part by the Institute refrain, while so engaged, from any partisan political activity.

    (b) __Use of funds for training programs for advocacy of nonjudicial public policies or encouraging nonjudicial political activities__ 

        No funds made available by the Institute under this chapter, either by grant, cooperative agreement, or contract, may be used to support or conduct training programs for the purpose of advocating particular nonjudicial public policies or encouraging nonjudicial political activities.

    (c) __Authority coextensive with appropriation Acts__ 

        The authorization to enter into cooperative agreements, contracts or any other obligation under this chapter shall be effective only to the extent, and in such amounts, as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

    (d) __Prohibited uses of funds__ 

    To ensure that funds made available under this chapter are used to supplement and improve the operation of State courts, rather than to support basic court services, funds shall not be used—

        (1) to supplant State or local funds currently supporting a program or activity; or

        (2) to construct court facilities or structures, except to remodel existing facilities to demonstrate new architectural or technological techniques, or to provide temporary facilities for new personnel or for personnel involved in a demonstration or experimental program.
