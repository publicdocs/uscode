 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (a), (b)(1)(C), and (f), was in the original “this title”, meaning title II of [Pub. L. 98–620][/us/pl/98/620], Nov. 8, 1984, [98 Stat. 3336][/us/stat/98/3336], known as the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title II to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 10701 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s10701] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1992—Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 102–528][/us/pl/102/528] struck out at end “The publication of a substantive rule shall not be made less than thirty days before the effective date of such rule, except as otherwise provided by the Institute for good cause found and published with the rule.”

    1988—Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] and [Pub. L. 100–702][/us/pl/100/702] made substantially identical amendments, striking out “, at least thirty days prior to their effective date,” after “Federal Register” and inserting sentence at end relating to publication of a substantive rule.

    1986—Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954” wherever appearing, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
