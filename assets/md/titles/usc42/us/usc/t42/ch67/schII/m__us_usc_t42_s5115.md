 __References in Text__ 

    This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this subtitle”, and was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title II of [Pub. L. 95–266][/us/pl/95/266], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 95–266][/us/pl/95/266] does not contain subtitles.
