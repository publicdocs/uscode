    [Section 5116d(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5116d/3], referred to in subsec. (b)(3), was in the original “section 205(a)(3)” and was translated as meaning [section 204(3) of Pub. L. 93–247][/us/pl/93/247/s204/3] to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the redesignation of section 205 as 204 by [Pub.
