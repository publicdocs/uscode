 __Amendments__ 

    2003—[Pub. L. 108–36][/us/pl/108/36] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, text consisted of subsecs. (a) to (d) relating to evaluations of demonstration projects, dissemination of information on assistance programs to individuals with special needs, a study and report on the estimated number of abandoned children to be completed by Apr. 1, 1992, and a study and report on effective care methods to be completed by Apr. 1, 1991.

    1991—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 102–236][/us/pl/102/236], § 4(a)(2), added subsec. (b). Former subsec. (b) redesignated (c).

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 102–236][/us/pl/102/236], § 4(a)(1), redesignated subsec. (b) as (c). Former subsec. (c) redesignated (d).

    Subsec. (c)(1)(A). [Pub. L. 102–236][/us/pl/102/236], § 4(b)(1), substituted “infants and young children who are infants and young children described in [section 5117aa–11(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5117aa–11/b]” for “infants who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome”.

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 102–236][/us/pl/102/236], § 4(b)(2), which directed striking out “ ‘The Secretary and all that follows through ‘Act,’ ” and inserting “Not later than April 1, 1992, the Secretary shall”, was executed by making the substitution for “The Secretary shall, not later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act,” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 102–236][/us/pl/102/236], § 4(a)(1), redesignated subsec. (c) as (d).
