    Before a State receives assistance under this section, and at three year intervals thereafter, the State task force shall comprehensively—

        (1) review and evaluate State investigative, administrative and both civil and criminal judicial handling of cases of child abuse and neglect, including child sexual abuse and exploitation, as well as cases involving suspected child maltreatment related fatalities and cases involving a potential combination of jurisdictions, such as intrastate, interstate, Federal-State, and State-Tribal; and

        (2) make policy and training recommendations in each of the categories described in subsection (e) of this section.

            (C) reform of State laws, ordinances, regulations, protocols, and procedures to provide comprehensive protection for children, which may include those children involved in reports of child abuse or neglect with a potential combination of jurisdictions, such as intrastate, interstate, Federal-State, and State-Tribal, from child abuse and neglect, including child sexual abuse and exploitation, while ensuring fairness to all affected persons.

        (2) __Exemption__ 

        As determined by the Secretary, a State shall be considered to be in fulfillment of the requirements of this subsection if—

            (A) the State adopts an alternative to the recommendations of the State task force, which carries out the purpose of this section, in each of the categories under paragraph (1) for which the State task force’s recommendations are not adopted; or

            (B) the State is making substantial progress toward adopting recommendations of the State task force or a comparable alternative to such recommendations.
