The period probably should be a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

        (2) how interstate placements are being financed across State lines;

        (3) recommendations on best practice models for both interstate and intrastate adoptions; and

        (4) how State policies in defining special needs children differentiate or group similar categories of children.

    (b) __Dynamics of successful adoption__

The Secretary shall submit a report containing the results of such research to the appropriate committees of the Congress not later than the date that is 36 months after June 25, 2003.

    (c) __Interjurisdictional adoption__
