## § 9704. National reactor engineering simulator feasibility study

    (a) __Consultative requirements; purpose__ 

        The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission and the Advisory Committee, shall initiate a study of the need for and feasibility of establishing a reactor engineering simulator facility at a national laboratory, for the primary purpose of fostering research in generic design improvements and simplifications through the simulation of the performance of various types of light water reactors under a wide variety of abnormal conditions and postulated accident conditions.

    (b) __Applicability of relevant factors__ 

    In performing the study, the Secretary shall consider relevant factors including, but not limited to—

        (1) the potential advantages that would accrue from the establishment of such a facility;

        (2) the extent to which such a facility would further the generic safety research and development program established by this chapter;

        (3) the extent to which such a facility can be established by nongovernmental entities;

        (4) the opportunities for cost sharing by nongovernmental entities in the construction and operation of such a facility;

        (5) the importance of such a facility in emergencies to limit the extent of any future nuclear powerplant excursions;

        (6) the potential for international cooperation in the establishment and operation of such a facility; and

        (7) the appropriate national laboratory for siting such a facility.

    (c) __Report to Congressional committees__ 

        The Secretary shall, by January 1, 1982, submit to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report characterizing the study and the resulting conclusions and recommendations.

([Pub. L. 96–567][/us/pl/96/567], § 5, Dec. 22, 1980, [94 Stat. 3331][/us/stat/94/3331].)

 __Change of Name__ 

    Committee on Science and Technology of House of Representatives changed to Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of House of Representatives by House Resolution No. 5, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Jan. 5, 2011.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of certain functions from Nuclear Regulatory Commission to Chairman thereof, see Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1980, 45 F.R. 40561, [94 Stat. 3585][/us/stat/94/3585], set out as a note under [section 5841 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5841].
