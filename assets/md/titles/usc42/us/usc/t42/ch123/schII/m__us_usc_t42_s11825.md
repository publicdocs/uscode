        (4) the extent to which such project or activity serves communities which have high rates of illicit drug use by juveniles (including runaway and homeless youth),

        (5) the extent to which such project or activity will provide services in geographical areas where similar services are unavailable or in short supply, and

 __References in Text__ 

    This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (b)(1)(A), was in the original “this part” and was translated as reading “this chapter” to reflect the probable intent of Congress because subtitle B of title III of [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690], which comprises subchapters I to III of this chapter, does not contain parts.

    Subsec. (b)(1)(C). [Pub. L. 101–204][/us/pl/101/204], § 1001(b)(1)(B), substituted “describing” for “a description of”.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 101–204][/us/pl/101/204], § 1001(b)(2), substituted “such officer” for “Administrator”.
