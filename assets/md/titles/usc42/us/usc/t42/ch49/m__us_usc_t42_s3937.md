        The partnership agreement shall include provisions designed to assure that (1) the partnership shall participate in low and moderate income housing developments, projects, or undertakings in a manner designed to encourage the participation therein of local interests, and (2) in any such development, project, or undertaking the partnership shall not subscribe to more than 25 per centum (including equity investments made in services or property) of the aggregate initial equity investment unless, in the judgment of the corporation as general partner, the balance of the required equity investment is not readily obtainable from other responsible investors residing or doing business in the local community.
