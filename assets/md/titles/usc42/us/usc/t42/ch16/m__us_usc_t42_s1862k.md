## § 1862k. Findings; core strategies

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress finds the following:

        (1) The United States depends upon its scientific and technological capabilities to preserve the military and economic security of the United States.

        (2) America’s leadership in the global marketplace is dependent upon a strong commitment to education, basic research, and development.

        (3) A nation that is not technologically literate cannot compete in the emerging global economy.

        (4) A coordinated commitment to mathematics and science instruction at all levels of education is a necessary component of successful efforts to produce technologically literate citizens.

        (5) Professional development is a necessary component of efforts to produce system-wide improvements in mathematics, engineering, and science education in secondary, elementary, and postsecondary settings.

        (6)

            (A) The mission of the National Science Foundation is to provide Federal support for basic scientific and engineering research, and to be a primary contributor to mathematics, science, and engineering education at academic institutions in the United States.

            (B)

             In accordance with such mission, the long-term goals of the National Science Foundation include providing leadership to—

                (i) enable the United States to maintain a position of world leadership in all aspects of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology;

                (ii) promote the discovery, integration, dissemination, and application of new knowledge in service to society; and

                (iii) achieve excellence in United States science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels.

    (b) __Core strategies__ 

    In carrying out activities designed to achieve the goals described in subsection (a), the Foundation shall use the following core strategies:

        (1) Develop intellectual capital, both people and ideas, with particular emphasis on groups and regions that traditionally have not participated fully in science, mathematics, and engineering.

        (2) Strengthen the scientific infrastructure by investing in facilities planning and modernization, instrument acquisition, instrument design and development, and shared-use research platforms.

        (3) Integrate research and education through activities that emphasize and strengthen the natural connections between learning and inquiry.

        (4) Promote partnerships with industry, elementary and secondary schools, community colleges, colleges and universities, other agencies, State and local governments, and other institutions involved in science, mathematics, and engineering to enhance the delivery of math and science education and improve the technological literacy of the citizens of the United States.
