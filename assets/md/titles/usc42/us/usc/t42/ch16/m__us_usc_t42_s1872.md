L. 90–407, § 10][/us/pl/90/407/s10], July 18, 1968, [82 Stat. 365][/us/stat/82/365]; [Pub. L. 99–159, title I, § 110(a)(16)][/us/pl/99/159/s110/a/16], (17), Nov. 22, 1985, [99 Stat. 891][/us/stat/99/891].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1874(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1874/d/2], referred to in subsec. (a), was redesignated section 1874(c)(2) by [Pub. L. 96–516, § 21(b)(2)][/us/pl/96/516/s21/b/2], Dec. 12, 1980, [94 Stat. 3010][/us/stat/94/3010].

 __Amendments__ 

    1985—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 99–159, § 110(a)(16)][/us/pl/99/159/s110/a/16], inserted “or engineering” after “scientific” the first three places appearing and “or engineers” after “scientists” and substituted “study and research in the sciences or in engineering” for “scientific study or scientific work”.

    Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 99–159, § 110(a)(17)][/us/pl/99/159/s110/a/17], inserted reference to engineering.

    1968—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 90–407][/us/pl/90/407] struck out “, with the approval of the Board,” after “The Director”, and substituted “section 15(d)(2) of this Act” for “section 16(d)(2) of this Act”, which resulted in no change in text because, for purposes of classification, provision was translated as “[section 1874(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1874/d/2]”.

    1959—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 86–232][/us/pl/86/232] authorized the Foundation, with approval of the Secretary of State, to cooperate in scientific activities rather than scientific research activities, and to grant fellowships or make other arrangements with foreign nationals for scientific study or scientific work in the United States.

    Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 86–232][/us/pl/86/232] struck out “research” from phrase “scientific research activities”.

 __Continuation of Existing Offices, Procedures, and Organization of the National Science Foundation__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 90–407][/us/pl/90/407] intended to continue in effect the existing offices, procedures, and organization of the Foundation, see [section 16 of Pub. L. 90–407][/us/pl/90/407/s16], set out as a note under [section 1862 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1862].
