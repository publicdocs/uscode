    (a)

     The Director shall operate an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, the purpose of which is to assist those States that—

    (b) A State which has received an initial award under such Program, whether or not the award was received before or after October 31, 1988, shall be eligible for up to 5 years of additional support under the program  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be capitalized. </sup></sup>  if that State provides assurances of new matching funds and submits an acceptable new plan for using Program funds and matching funds to build the research capabilities of the State.
