## § 13542. Cost sharing

    (a) __Research and development__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this Act, for research and development programs carried out under this Act, the Secretary shall require a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 20 percent of the cost of the project. The Secretary may reduce or eliminate the non-Federal requirement under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the research and development is of a basic or fundamental nature.

    (b) __Demonstration and commercial application__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the Secretary shall require at least 50 percent of the costs directly and specifically related to any demonstration or commercial application project under this Act to be provided from non-Federal sources. The Secretary may reduce the non-Federal requirement under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the reduction is necessary and appropriate considering the technological risks involved in the project and is necessary to meet the objectives of this Act.

    (c) __Calculation of amount__ 

        In calculating the amount of the non-Federal commitment under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary shall include cash, personnel, services, equipment, and other resources.

    (d) __Tennessee Valley Authority__ 

        Funds derived by the Tennessee Valley Authority from its power program may be used for all or part of any cost sharing requirements under this section, except to the extent that such funds are provided by annual appropriation Acts.
