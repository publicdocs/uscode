    (d) __Application of requirements__ 

        The provisions of [section 6374 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6374] relating to the Federal acquisition of alternative fueled vehicles shall apply to the acquisition of vehicles pursuant to this section.

            (A) __Federal agency__ 

                The term “Federal agency” does not include any office of the legislative branch, except that it does include the House of Representatives with respect to an acquisition described in paragraph (2)(C).

            (B) __Medium duty passenger vehicle__ 

                The term “medium duty passenger vehicle” has the meaning given that term  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The word “in” probably should appear after “term”. </sup></sup>  section 523.2 of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on December 19, 2007.

            (C) __Member’s Representational Allowance__ 

                The term “Member’s Representational Allowance” means the allowance described in [section 57b(a) of title 2][/us/usc/t2/s57b/a].

        (2) __Prohibition__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no Federal agency shall acquire a light duty motor vehicle or medium duty passenger vehicle that is not a low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to acquisition of a vehicle if the head of the agency certifies in writing, in a separate certification for each individual vehicle purchased, either—

                (i) that no low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle is available to meet the functional needs of the agency and details in writing the functional needs that could not be met with a low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle; or

                (ii)

                 that the agency has taken specific alternative more cost-effective measures to reduce petroleum consumption that—

                    (I) have reduced a measured and verified quantity of greenhouse gas emissions equal to or greater than the quantity of greenhouse gas reductions that would have been achieved through acquisition of a low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle over the lifetime of the vehicle; or

                    (II) will reduce each year a measured and verified quantity of greenhouse gas emissions equal to or greater than the quantity of greenhouse gas reductions that would have been achieved each year through acquisition of a low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle.

            (C) __Special rule for vehicles provided by funds contained in Members’ Representational Allowance__ 

                This paragraph shall apply to the acquisition of a light duty motor vehicle or medium duty passenger vehicle using any portion of a Member’s Representational Allowance, including an acquisition under a long-term lease.

        (3) __Guidance__

            (B) __Consideration__ 

                In identifying vehicles under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall take into account the most stringent standards for vehicle greenhouse gas emissions applicable to and enforceable against motor vehicle manufacturers for vehicles sold anywhere in the United States.

            (C) __Requirement__ 

                The Administrator shall not identify any vehicle as a low greenhouse gas emitting vehicle if the vehicle emits greenhouse gases at a higher rate than such standards allow for the manufacturer’s fleet average grams per mile of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions for that class of vehicle, taking into account any emissions allowances and adjustment factors such standards provide.

    (g) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated for carrying out this section, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1998, to remain available until expended.
