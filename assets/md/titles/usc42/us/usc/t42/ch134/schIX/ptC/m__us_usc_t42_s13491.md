## § 13491. Purposes and definitions

    (a) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this part are—

        (1) to require the Secretary to carry out civilian nuclear programs in a way that will lead toward the commercial availability of advanced nuclear reactor technologies; and

        (2) to authorize such activities to further the timely availability of advanced nuclear reactor technologies, including technologies that utilize standardized designs or exhibit passive safety features.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this part—

        (1)

         the term “advanced nuclear reactor technologies” means—

            (A) advanced light water reactors that may be commercially available in the near-term, including but not limited to mid-sized reactors with passive safety features for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission; and

            (B) other advanced nuclear reactor technologies that may require prototype demonstration prior to commercial availability in the mid- or long-term, including but not limited to high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors and liquid metal reactors, for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission;

        (2) the term “Commission” means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;

        (3) the term “standardized design” means a design for a nuclear power plant that may be utilized for a multiple number of units or a multiple number of sites; and

        (4) the term “certification” means approval by the Commission of a standardized design.
