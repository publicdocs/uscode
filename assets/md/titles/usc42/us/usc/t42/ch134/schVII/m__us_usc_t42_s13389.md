See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  the Secretary may enter into cooperative research and development agreements under [section 3710a of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s3710a].

([Pub. L. 102–486, title XVI][/us/pl/102/486/tXVI], § 1610, as added [Pub. L. 109–58, title XVI][/us/pl/109/58/tXVI], § 1601, Aug. 8, 2005, [119 Stat. 1109][/us/stat/119/1109].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 15801(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s15801/3], referred to in subsec. (a)(7), was in the original “section 3(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005” and was translated as meaning section 2(3) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because the Energy Policy Act of 2005 does not contain a section 3 and section 2(3) defines “National Laboratory”.

    This subtitle, referred to in subsec. (j), appearing in the original, is unidentifiable because title XVI of [Pub. L. 102–486][/us/pl/102/486], of which this section is a part, does not contain subtitles.
