        (2) to ascertain how such Government entities or consumer cooperatives may be educated in the prudent use of energy futures and options contracts to maximize their purchasing effectiveness, protect themselves against unanticipated surges in the price of fuel, and minimize fuel costs.

    (b) __Pilot program__ 

        The Secretary shall conduct a pilot program, commencing not later than 30 days after the transmission of the study required in subsection (b)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this section, to educate such governmental entities, consumer cooperatives, or other organizations on the prudent and cost-effective use of energy futures and options contracts to increase their protection against unanticipated surges in the price of fuel and thereby increase the efficiency of their fuel purchase or assistance programs.
