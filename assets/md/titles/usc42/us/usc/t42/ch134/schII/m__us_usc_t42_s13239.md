## § 13239. Low interest loan program

    (a) __Establishment__ 

    Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall establish a program for making low interest loans, giving preference to small businesses that own or operate fleets, for—

        (1) the conversion of motor vehicles to operation on alternative fuels;

        (2) covering the incremental costs of the purchase of motor vehicles which operate on alternative fuels, when compared with purchase costs of comparable conventionally fueled motor vehicles; or

        (3) covering the incremental costs of purchase of non-road vehicles and engines designated by the Secretary pursuant to [section 13238(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s13238/c].

    (b) __Loan terms__ 

        The Secretary, to the extent practicable, shall establish reasonable terms for loans made under this subsection, with preference given to repayment schedules that enable such loans to be repaid by the borrower from the cost differential between gasoline and the alternative fuel on which the motor vehicle operates.

    (c) __Criteria__ 

    In deciding to whom loans shall be made under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider—

        (1) the financial need of the applicant;

        (2) the goal of assisting the greatest number of applicants; and

        (3) the ability of an applicant to repay the loan, taking into account the fuel cost savings likely to accrue to the applicant.

    (d) __Priorities__ 

        Priority shall be given under this section to fleets where the use of alternative fuels would have a significant beneficial effect on energy security and the environment.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying out this section, $25,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995.
