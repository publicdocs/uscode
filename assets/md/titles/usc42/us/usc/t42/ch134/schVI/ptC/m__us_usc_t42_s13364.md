    (b) __Study and report to Congress__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall conduct a detailed and comprehensive study on the institutional, legal, and regulatory barriers to increased utilization of coal combustion byproducts by potential governmental and commercial users. Such study shall identify and investigate barriers found to exist at the Federal, State, or local level, which may have limited or may have the foreseeable effect of limiting the quantities of coal combustion byproducts that are utilized. In conducting this study, the Secretary shall consult with other departments and agencies of the Federal Government, appropriate State and local governments, and the private sector.

         Not later than one year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress containing the results of the study required by paragraph (1) and the Secretary’s recommendations for action to be taken to increase the utilization of coal combustion byproducts. At a minimum, such report shall identify actions that would increase the utilization of coal combustion byproducts in—

            (B) stabilizing wastes;

            (C) procurement by departments and agencies of the Federal Government and State and local governments; and
