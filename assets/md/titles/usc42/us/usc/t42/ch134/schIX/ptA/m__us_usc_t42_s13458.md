        The purpose of this section is to encourage energy efficiency in buildings through the establishment of regional centers to promote energy efficient lighting, heating and cooling, and building design.

    (b) __Grants for establishment__ 

        Not later than 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall make grants to nonprofit institutions, or to consortiums that may include nonprofit institutions, State and local governments, universities, and utilities, to establish or enhance one regional building energy efficiency center (hereafter in this section referred to as a “regional center”) in each of the 10 regions served by a Department of Energy regional support office.

    (c) __Permitted activities__ 

    Each regional center established under this section may—

        (1) provide information, training, and technical assistance to building professionals such as architects, designers, engineers, contractors, and building code officials, on building energy efficiency methods and technologies, including lighting, heating and cooling, and passive solar;

        (2) operate an outreach program to inform such building professionals of the benefits and opportunities of energy efficiency, and of the services of the center;

        (3) provide displays demonstrating building energy efficiency methods and technologies, such as lighting, windows, and heating and cooling equipment;

        (4) coordinate its activities and programs with other institutions within the region, such as State and local governments, utilities, and educational institutions, in order to support their efforts to promote building energy efficiency;

        (5) serve as a clearinghouse to ensure that information about new building energy efficiency technologies, including case studies of successful applications, is disseminated to end-users in the region;

        (6) study the building energy needs of the region and make available region-specific energy efficiency information to facilitate the adoption of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements;

        (7) assist educational institutions in establishing building energy efficiency engineering and technical programs and curricula; and

        (8) evaluate the performance of the center in promoting building energy efficiency.

    (d) __Application__ 

        Any nonprofit institution or consortium interested in receiving a grant under this section shall submit to the Secretary an application in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may require.

        (2) The demonstrated or potential resources available to the grant recipient for carrying out this subsection.

        (3) The demonstrated or potential ability of the grant recipient to promote building energy efficiency by carrying out the activities specified in subsection (c) of this section.
