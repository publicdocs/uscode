## CHAPTER 75—PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

 __Codification__ 

    The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, formerly comprising this chapter, was title I of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963, which was originally enacted by [Pub. L. 88–164][/us/pl/88/164], Oct. 31, 1963, [77 Stat. 282][/us/stat/77/282], at which time title I was known as the Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act, and parts B and C of such title I were classified to subchapters I (§ 2661 et seq.) and II (§ 2670 et seq.), respectively, of chapter 33 of this title. Because of the extensive amendments, reorganization of the subject matter, and expansion of the Act by the acts summarized below, the Act was set out here as having been added by [Pub. L. 98–527][/us/pl/98/527], without reference to intervening amendments.

    Part D of the Act was added by [Pub. L. 90–170][/us/pl/90/170], § 4, Dec. 4, 1967, [81 Stat. 528][/us/stat/81/528], and was classified to subchapter IIA (§ 2678 et seq.) of chapter 33 of this title. Part C of the Act was amended generally and the Act was reorganized and renamed the Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act, by [Pub. L. 91–517][/us/pl/91/517], Oct. 30, 1970, [84 Stat. 1316][/us/stat/84/1316].

    Parts A, B, and D of the Act were amended generally and the Act was otherwise extensively amended and reorganized by [Pub. L. 94–103][/us/pl/94/103], Oct. 4, 1975, [89 Stat. 486][/us/stat/89/486], and was reclassified to this chapter.

    The Act was renamed the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and was amended and reorganized by [Pub. L. 95–602, title V][/us/pl/95/602/tV], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 3003][/us/stat/92/3003], and was subsequently amended generally and completely reorganized by [Pub. L. 98–527][/us/pl/98/527], § 2, Oct. 19, 1984, [98 Stat. 2662][/us/stat/98/2662].

    For provisions similar to former chapter 75 of this title, relating to programs for individuals with developmental disabilities, see subchapter I (§ 15001 et seq.) of chapter 144 of this title.
