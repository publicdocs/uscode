 __Codification__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148] is based on section 202(a) of title II of S. 1790, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, as reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate in Dec. 2009, which was enacted into law by [section 10221(a) of Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148/s10221/a].

    The 1992 amendment is based on section 1 of S. 2681, One Hundred Second Congress, as passed by the Senate on Aug. 7, 1992, and enacted into law by [section 9168 of Pub. L. 102–396][/us/pl/102/396/s9168]. Section 9168, which referred to S. 2681, as passed by the Senate on “September 12, 1992”, has been treated as referring to S. 2681, as passed by the Senate on Aug. 7, 1992, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    [Pub. L. 100–579][/us/pl/100/579] and [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] enacted substantially identical sections. The text of this section is based on [section 1 of Pub. L. 100–579][/us/pl/100/579/s1], as subsequently amended.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148], which directed the amendment of section 7(b) of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 by substituting “2019” for “2001”, was executed by making the amendment to this section, which is section 7 of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–396][/us/pl/102/396] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section related to assignment of personnel.
