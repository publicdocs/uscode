            (B)

             The Subseabed Consortium shall develop a research plan and budget to achieve the following objectives by 1995:

                (i) demonstrate the capacity to identify and characterize potential subseabed disposal sites;

                (ii) develop conceptual designs for a subseabed disposal system, including estimated costs and institutional requirements; and

                (iii) identify and assess the potential impacts of subseabed disposal on the human and marine environment.

            (C) In 1990, and again in 1995, the Subseabed Consortium shall report to Congress on the progress being made in achieving the objectives of paragraph (2).

 __Amendments__ 

    1998—Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 105–245][/us/pl/105/245] which directed the substitution of “Science” for “Energy Research”, was executed by making the substitution in two places to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsec. (b)(2). [Pub. L. 105–245][/us/pl/105/245] substituted “Office of Science” for “Office of Energy Research”.

    1995—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 104–66][/us/pl/104/66] struck out subsec. (a) which required Secretary of Energy to report to Congress on subseabed disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.

    Subsec. (b)(5). [Pub. L. 104–66][/us/pl/104/66] struck out par. (5) which read as follows: “The Director of the Office of Subseabed Disposal Research shall annually prepare and submit a report to the Congress on the activities and expenditures of the Office.”
