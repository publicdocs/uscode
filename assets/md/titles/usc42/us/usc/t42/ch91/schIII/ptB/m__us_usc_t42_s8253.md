        (2) An agency may exclude from the requirements of paragraph (1) any building, and the associated energy consumption and gross square footage, in which energy intensive activities are carried out. Each agency shall identify and list in each report made under [section 8258(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8258/a] the buildings designated by it for such exclusion.

        (3) Not later than December 31, 2014, the Secretary shall review the results of the implementation of the energy performance requirement established under paragraph (1) and submit to Congress recommendations concerning energy performance requirements for fiscal years 2016 through 2025.

    (b) __Energy management requirement for Federal agencies__ 

        (1) Not later than January 1, 2005, each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, install in Federal buildings owned by the United States all energy and water conservation measures with payback periods of less than 10 years, as determined by using the methods and procedures developed pursuant to [section 8254 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8254].

        (2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for any agency for such periods as the Secretary may determine if the Secretary finds that the agency is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements and that the requirements of this subsection will pose an unacceptable burden upon the agency. If the Secretary waives the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall, as part of the report required under [section 8258(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8258/b], notify the Congress in writing with an explanation and a justification of the reasons for such waiver.

        (3) This subsection shall not apply to an agency’s facilities that generate or transmit electric energy or to the uranium enrichment facilities operated by the Department of Energy.

        (4) An agency may participate in the Environmental Protection Agency’s “Green Lights” program for purposes of receiving technical assistance in complying with the requirements of this section.

    (c) __Exclusions__ 

        (1)

            (A)

             An agency may exclude, from the energy performance requirement for a fiscal year established under subsection (a) of this section and the energy management requirement established under subsection (b) of this section, any Federal building or collection of Federal buildings, if the head of the agency finds that—

                (i) compliance with those requirements would be impracticable;

                (ii) the agency has completed and submitted all federally required energy management reports;

                (iii) the agency has achieved compliance with the energy efficiency requirements of this chapter, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Executive orders, and other Federal law; and

            (B)

             A finding of impracticability under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be based on—

                (i) the energy intensiveness of activities carried out in the Federal building or collection of Federal buildings; or

                (ii) the fact that the Federal building or collection of Federal buildings is used in the performance of a national security function.

        (2) Each agency shall identify and list, in each report made under [section 8258(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8258/a], the Federal buildings designated by it for such exclusion. The Secretary shall review such findings for consistency with the standards for exclusion set forth in paragraph (1), and may within 90 days after receipt of the findings, reverse the exclusion. In the case of any such reversal, the agency shall comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b)(1) of this section for the building concerned.

        (3) Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue guidelines that establish criteria for exclusions under paragraph (1).
