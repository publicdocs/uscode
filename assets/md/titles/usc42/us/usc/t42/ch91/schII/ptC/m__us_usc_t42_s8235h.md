## § 8235h. Revoking approval of plans and terminating financial assistance

The Secretary shall revoke the approval of any plan under [section 8235a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8235a/a] for the establishment of a prototype residential energy efficiency program, and shall terminate the provision of financial assistance under [section 8235a(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8235a/c] to carry out such plan, if the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, that carrying out such plan—

    (1) causes unfair methods of competition;

    (2) has a substantial adverse effect on competition in the portion of the service area of the public utility designated by the contract entered into under the plan; or

    (3) provides a supplier or contractor of energy conservation measures with an unreasonably large share of the contracts for the supply or installation of such measures under such plan in the service area of the public utility designated by the contract entered into under such plan.
