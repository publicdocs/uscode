## § 8254. Establishment and use of life cycle cost methods and procedures

    (a) __Establishment of life cycle cost methods and procedures__ 

    The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, shall—

        (1) establish practical and effective present value methods for estimating and comparing life cycle costs for Federal buildings, using the sum of all capital and operating expenses associated with the energy system of the building involved over the expected life of such system or during a period of 40 years, whichever is shorter, and using average fuel costs and a discount rate determined by the Secretary; and

        (2) develop and prescribe the procedures to be followed in applying and implementing the methods so established.

    (b) __Use of life cycle cost methods and procedures__ 

        (1) The design of new Federal buildings, and the application of energy conservation measures to existing Federal buildings, shall be made using life cycle cost methods and procedures established under subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) In leasing buildings for its own use or that of another agency, each agency shall, after January 1, 1994, fully consider the efficiency of all potential building space at the time of renewing or entering into a new lease.

    (c) __Use in non-Federal structures__ 

        The Secretary shall make available information to the public on the use of life cycle cost methods in the construction of buildings, structures, and facilities in all segments of the economy.
