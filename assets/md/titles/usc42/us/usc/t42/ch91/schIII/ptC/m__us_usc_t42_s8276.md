## § 8276. System evaluation and purchase program

    (a) __Program__ 

        The Secretary shall establish, within 60 days after November 9, 1978, a photovoltaic systems evaluation and purchase program to provide such systems as are required by the Federal agencies to carry out this part. In acquiring photovoltaic solar electric systems under this part, the Secretary (or other Federal agency acting under delegation from the Secretary) shall insure that such systems reflect to the maximum extent practicable the most advanced and reliable technologies and shall schedule purchases in a manner which will stimulate the early development of a permanent low-cost private photovoltaic production capability in the United States, and to stimulate the private sector market for photovoltaic power systems. The Secretary and other Federal agencies acting under delegation from the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, procure not more than 30 megawatts of photovoltaic solar electric systems during fiscal years ending September 30, 1979, September 30, 1980, and September 30, 1981.

    (b) __Other procurement__ 

        Nothing in this part shall preclude any Federal agency from directly procuring a photovoltaic solar electric system (in lieu of obtaining one under the program under subsection (a) of this section), except that any such Federal agency shall consult with the Secretary before procuring such a system.
