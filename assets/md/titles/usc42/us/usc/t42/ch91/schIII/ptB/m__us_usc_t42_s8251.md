## § 8251. Findings

    The Congress finds that—

    (1) the Federal Government is the largest single energy consumer in the Nation;

    (2) the cost of meeting the Federal Government’s energy requirement is substantial;

    (3) there are significant opportunities in the Federal Government to conserve and make more efficient use of energy through improved operations and maintenance, the use of new energy efficient technologies, and the application and achievement of energy efficient design and construction;

    (4) Federal energy conservation measures can be financed at little or no cost to the Federal Government by using private investment capital made available through contracts authorized by subchapter VII of this chapter; and

    (5) an increase in energy efficiency by the Federal Government would benefit the Nation by reducing the cost of government, reducing national dependence on foreign energy resources, and demonstrating the benefits of greater energy efficiency to the Nation.

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Energy Conservation Policy Act ([Public Law 95–619][/us/pl/95/619], [92 Stat. 3206][/us/stat/92/3206], [42 U.S.C. 8252][/us/usc/t42/s8252] et seq.), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) ([Public Law 102–486][/us/pl/102/486], [106 Stat. 2776][/us/stat/106/2776]), and [section 301 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301], United States Code, and in order to further encourage energy conservation by the Federal Government, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1. Energy Efficient Standby Power Devices. Each agency, when it purchases commercially available, off-the-shelf products that use external standby power devices, or that contain an internal standby power function, shall purchase products that use no more than one watt in their standby power consuming mode. If such products are not available, agencies shall purchase products with the lowest standby power wattage while in their standby power consuming mode. Agencies shall adhere to these requirements, when life-cycle cost-effective and practicable and where the relevant product’s utility and performance are not compromised as a result. By December 31, 2001, and on an annual basis thereafter, the Department of Energy, in consultation with the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration, shall compile a preliminary list of products to be subject to these requirements. The Department of Energy shall finalize the list and may remove products deemed inappropriate for listing.

    Sec. 2. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are encouraged to comply with the provisions of this order.

    Sec. 3. Definition. “Agency” means an executive agency as defined in [5 U.S.C. 105][/us/usc/t5/s105]. For the purpose of this order, military departments, as defined in [5 U.S.C. 102][/us/usc/t5/s102], are covered by the Department of Defense.
