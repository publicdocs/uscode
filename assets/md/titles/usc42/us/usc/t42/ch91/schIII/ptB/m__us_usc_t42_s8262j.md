A finding of impracticability shall be based on the energy intensiveness of activities carried out in such facility or collection of facilities, the type and amount of energy consumed, or the technical feasibility of making the desired changes. The Postmaster General shall identify and list in the report required under [section 8262i of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8262i] the facilities designated by it for such exclusion.
