## § 4913. Quiet communities, research, and public information

    To promote the development of effective State and local noise control programs, to provide an adequate Federal noise control research program designed to meet the objectives of this chapter, and to otherwise carry out the policy of this chapter, the Administrator shall, in cooperation with other Federal agencies and through the use of grants, contracts, and direct Federal actions—

    (a) develop and disseminate information and educational materials to all segments of the public on the public health and other effects of noise and the most effective means for noise control, through the use of materials for school curricula, volunteer organizations, radio and television programs, publication, and other means;

    (b)

     conduct or finance research directly or with any public or private organization or any person on the effects, measurement, and control of noise, including but not limited to—

        (1) investigation of the psychological and physiological effects of noise on humans and the effects of noise on domestic animals, wildlife, and property, and the determination of dose/response relationships suitable for use in decisionmaking, with special emphasis on the nonauditory effects of noise;

        (2) investigation, development, and demonstration of noise control technology for products subject to possible regulation under sections 4905 and 4907 of this title and [section 44715 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s44715];

        (3) investigation, development, and demonstration of monitoring equipment and other technology especially suited for use by State and local noise control programs;

        (4) investigation of the economic impact of noise on property and human activities; and

        (5) investigation and demonstration of the use of economic incentives (including emission charges) in the control of noise;

    (c)

     administer a nationwide Quiet Communities Program which shall include, but not be limited to—

        (1)

         grants to States, local governments, and authorized regional planning agencies for the purpose of—

            (A) identifying and determining the nature and extent of the noise problem within the subject jurisdiction;

            (B) planning, developing, and establishing a noise control capacity in such jurisdiction, including purchasing initial equipment;

            (C) developing abatement plans for areas around major transportation facilities (including airports, highways, and rail yards) and other major stationary sources of noise, and, where appropriate, for the facility or source itself; and,

            (D) evaluating techniques for controlling noise (including institutional arrangements) and demonstrating the best available techniques in such jurisdiction;

        (2) purchase of monitoring and other equipment for loan to State and local noise control programs to meet special needs or assist in the beginning implementation of a noise control program or project;

        (3) development and implementation of a quality assurance program for equipment and monitoring procedures of State and local noise control programs to help communities assure that their data collection activities are accurate;

        (4) conduct of studies and demonstrations to determine the resource and personnel needs of States and local governments required for the establishment and implementation of effective noise abatement and control programs; and

        (5) development of education and training materials and programs, including national and regional workshops, to support State and local noise abatement and control programs;

        except that no actions, plans or programs hereunder shall be inconsistent with existing Federal authority under this chapter to regulate sources of noise in interstate commerce;

    (d) develop and implement a national noise environmental assessment program to identify trends in noise exposure and response, ambient levels, and compliance data and to determine otherwise the effectiveness of noise abatement actions through the collection of physical, social, and human response data;

    (e) establish regional technical assistance centers which use the capabilities of university and private organizations to assist State and local noise control programs;

    (f) provide technical assistance to State and local governments to facilitate their development and enforcement of noise control, including direct onsite assistance of agency or other personnel with technical expertise, and preparation of model State or local legislation for noise control; and

    (g) provide for the maximum use in programs assisted under this section of senior citizens and persons eligible for participation in programs under the Older Americans Act \[[42 U.S.C. 3001][/us/usc/t42/s3001] et seq.\].

([Pub. L. 92–574][/us/pl/92/574], § 14, Oct. 27, 1972, [86 Stat. 1244][/us/stat/86/1244]; [Pub. L. 95–609][/us/pl/95/609], § 2, Nov. 8, 1978, [92 Stat. 3079][/us/stat/92/3079].)

 __References in Text__

 __Codification__ 

    In subsec. (b)(2), “[section 44715 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s44715]” substituted for reference to section 7 of this Act, meaning [section 7 of Pub. L. 92–574][/us/pl/92/574/s7], which generally amended section 611 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1431), on authority of [Pub. L. 103–272][/us/pl/103/272], § 6(b), July 5, 1994, [108 Stat. 1378][/us/stat/108/1378], the first section of which enacted subtitles II, III, and V to X of Title 49, Transportation.

 __Amendments__ 

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–609][/us/pl/95/609] completely revised and restructured existing provisions, inserting provisions relating to authorized use of grants and direct action, investigation of economic impact of noise, administration of Quiet Communities Program, development of noise assessment program, establishment of regional centers, technical assistance to State and local governments, and use by senior citizens of these programs.
