## § 2000d–6. Policy of United States as to application of nondiscrimination provisions in schools of local educational agencies

    (a) __Declaration of uniform policy__ 

        It is the policy of the United States that guidelines and criteria established pursuant to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \[[42 U.S.C. 2000d][/us/usc/t42/s2000d] et seq.\] and section 182 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1966 \[[42 U.S.C. 2000d–5][/us/usc/t42/s2000d–5]\] dealing with conditions of segregation by race, whether de jure or de facto, in the schools of the local educational agencies of any State shall be applied uniformly in all regions of the United States whatever the origin or cause of such segregation.

    (b) __Nature of uniformity__ 

        Such uniformity refers to one policy applied uniformly to de jure segregation wherever found and such other policy as may be provided pursuant to law applied uniformly to de facto segregation wherever found.

    (c) __Prohibition of construction for diminution of obligation for enforcement or compliance with nondiscrimination requirements__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the obligation of responsible officials to enforce or comply with such guidelines and criteria in order to eliminate discrimination in federally assisted programs and activities as required by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \[[42 U.S.C. 2000d][/us/usc/t42/s2000d] et seq.\].

    (d) __Additional funds__ 

        It is the sense of the Congress that the Department of Justice and the Secretary of Education should request such additional funds as may be necessary to apply the policy set forth in this section throughout the United States.
