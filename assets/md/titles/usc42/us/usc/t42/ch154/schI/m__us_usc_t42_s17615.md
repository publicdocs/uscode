        It is the purpose and intent of Congress that the National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System established in subsection (a) is intended to continue and build upon Operation Fairplay developed by the Wyoming Attorney General’s office, which has established a secure, dynamic undercover infrastructure that has facilitated online law enforcement investigations of child exploitation, information sharing, and the capacity to collect and aggregate data on the extent of the problems of child exploitation.

    (c) __Purpose of system__ 

    The National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System established under subsection (a) shall be dedicated to assisting and supporting credentialed law enforcement agencies authorized to investigate child exploitation in accordance with Federal, State, local, and tribal laws, including by providing assistance and support to—

        (2) the ICAC Task Force Program established under [section 17612 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17612];

        (3) State, local, and tribal agencies investigating and prosecuting child exploitation; and

        (3)

         shall—

            (A) allow Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies and ICAC task forces investigating and prosecuting child exploitation to contribute and access data for use in resolving case conflicts;

            (B) provide, directly or in partnership with a credentialed law enforcement agency, a dynamic undercover infrastructure to facilitate online law enforcement investigations of child exploitation;

            (C) facilitate the development of essential software and network capability for law enforcement participants; and

            (D) provide software or direct hosting and support for online investigations of child exploitation activities, or, in the alternative, provide users with a secure connection to an alternative system that provides such capabilities, provided that the system is hosted within a governmental agency or a credentialed law enforcement agency.

    (e) __Collection and reporting of data__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System established under subsection (a) shall ensure the following:

            (B) __High-priority suspects__ 

            Every 30 days, at minimum, the National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System shall—

                (i) identify high-priority suspects, as such suspects are determined by indicators of seriousness of offense or dangerousness to the community or a potential local victim; and

                (ii) report all such identified high-priority suspects to participating law enforcement agencies.

            (C) __Annual reports__ 

                Any statistical data indicating the overall magnitude of child pornography trafficking and child exploitation in the United States and internationally is made available and included in the National Strategy, as is required under [section 17611(c)(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17611/c/16].

    (f) __Mandatory requirements of network__ 

    The National Internet Crimes Against Children Data System established under subsection (a) shall develop, deploy, and maintain an integrated technology and training program that provides—

        (1) a secure, online system for Federal law enforcement agencies, ICAC task forces, and other State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies for use in resolving case conflicts, as provided in subsection (d);

        (2) a secure system enabling online communication and collaboration by Federal law enforcement agencies, ICAC task forces, and other State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies regarding ongoing investigations, investigatory techniques, best practices, and any other relevant news and professional information;
