## § 15602. Purposes

The purposes of this chapter are to—

    (1) establish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence of prison rape in prisons in the United States;

    (2) make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in each prison system;

    (3) develop and implement national standards for the detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison rape;

    (4) increase the available data and information on the incidence of prison rape, consequently improving the management and administration of correctional facilities;

    (5) standardize the definitions used for collecting data on the incidence of prison rape;

    (6) increase the accountability of prison officials who fail to detect, prevent, reduce, and punish prison rape;

    (7) protect the Eighth Amendment rights of Federal, State, and local prisoners;

    (8) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; poverty; unemployment; and homelessness; and

    (9) reduce the costs that prison rape imposes on interstate commerce.
