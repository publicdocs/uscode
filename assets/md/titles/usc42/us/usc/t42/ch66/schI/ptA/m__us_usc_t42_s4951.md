## § 4951. Congressional statement of purpose

    This part provides for the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program of full-time volunteer service, together with appropriate powers and responsibilities designed to assist in the development and coordination of such program.

In addition, the objectives of this part are to generate the commitment of private sector resources, to encourage volunteer service at the local level, to support efforts by local agencies and community organizations to achieve long-term sustainability of projects, and to strengthen local agencies and community organizations to carry out the objectives of this part.
