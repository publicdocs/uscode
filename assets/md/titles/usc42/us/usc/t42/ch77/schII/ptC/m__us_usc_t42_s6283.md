## § 6283. Summer fill and fuel budgeting programs

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Budget contract__ 

            The term “budget contract” means a contract between a retailer and a consumer under which the heating expenses of the consumer are spread evenly over a period of months.

        (2) __Fixed-price contract__ 

            The term “fixed-price contract” means a contract between a retailer and a consumer under which the retailer charges the consumer a set price for propane, kerosene, or heating oil without regard to market price fluctuations.

        (3) __Price cap contract__ 

            The term “price cap contract” means a contract between a retailer and a consumer under which the retailer charges the consumer the market price for propane, kerosene, or heating oil, but the cost of the propane, kerosene, or heating oil may exceed a maximum amount stated in the contract.

    (b) __Assistance__ 

    At the request of the chief executive officer of a State, the Secretary shall provide information, technical assistance, and funding—

        to avoid severe seasonal price increases for and supply shortages of those products.

    (c) __Preference__ 

        In implementing this section, the Secretary shall give preference to States that contribute public funds or leverage private funds to develop State summer fill and fuel budgeting programs.

    (d) __Authorization of appropriations__
