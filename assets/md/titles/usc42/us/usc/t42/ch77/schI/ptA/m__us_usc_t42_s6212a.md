        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), to promote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of crude oil.

    (c) __Savings clause__ 

        Nothing in this section limits the authority of the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ([50 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t50/s1701] et seq.) or regulations issued under that Act (other than section 754.2 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations), the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t50/s1601] et seq.), part B of title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ([42 U.S.C. 6271][/us/usc/t42/s6271] et seq.), the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C.

    (d) __Exceptions and presidential authority__ 

        (1) __In general__

            (B) the export licensing requirements or other restrictions on the export of crude oil from the United States under this subsection apply to 1 or more countries, persons, or organizations in the context of sanctions or trade restrictions imposed by the United States for reasons of national security by the Executive authority of the President or by Congress; or

            (C)

             the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, finds and reports to the President that—
