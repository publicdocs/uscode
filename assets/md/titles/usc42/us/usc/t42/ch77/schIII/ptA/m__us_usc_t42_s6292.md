        (1)

         The Secretary may classify a type of consumer product as a covered product if he determines that—

            (A) classifying products of such type as covered products is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and

            (B) average annual per-household energy use by products of such type is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours (or its Btu equivalent) per year.

        (2)

         For purposes of this subsection:

            (A) The term “average annual per-household energy use with respect to a type of product” means the estimated aggregate annual energy use (in kilowatt-hours or the Btu equivalent) of consumer products of such type which are used by households in the United States, divided by the number of such households which use products of such type.

            (B) The Btu equivalent of one kilowatt-hour is 3,412 British thermal units.

            (C) The term “household” shall be defined under rules of the Secretary.
