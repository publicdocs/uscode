Allocation under such rule shall be in such amounts and at such prices as are specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) such rule. Such rule may apply to any petroleum product owned or controlled by any person described in the first sentence of this subsection who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, including any petroleum product destined, directly or indirectly, for import into the United States or any foreign country, or produced in the United States. Subject to subsection (b)(2) of this section, such a rule shall remain in effect until amended or rescinded by the President.

            (C) has transmitted such finding to the Congress, together with a statement of the effective date and manner for exercise of such rule.

        (2) No rule under subsection (b) of this section may be put into effect or remain in effect after the expiration of 12 months after the date such rule was transmitted to Congress under paragraph (1)(A).

    (c) __Consistency of rule with attainment of objectives specified in section 753(b)(1)__  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ See References in Text note below.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __of title 15; limitation on authority of officers or agencies of United States__ 

        (1) Any rule under this section shall be consistent with the attainment, to the maximum extent practicable, of the objectives specified in section 753(b)(1) 1 of title 15.

        (2) No officer or agency of the United States shall have any authority, other than authority under this section, to require that petroleum products be allocated to other countries for the purpose of implementation of the obligations of the United States under the international energy program.

        Neither section 6212 1 of this title nor [section 185(u) of title 30][/us/usc/t30/s185/u] shall preclude the allocation and export, to other countries in accordance with this section, of petroleum products produced in the United States.

    (e) __Prerequisites for effectiveness of rule__ 

    No rule under this section may be put into effect unless—

        (1) an international energy supply emergency, as defined in the first sentence of [section 6272(k)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6272/k/1], is in effect; and

        (2) the allocation of available oil referred to in chapter III of the international energy program has been activated pursuant to chapter IV of such program.
