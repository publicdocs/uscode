## § 6372c. State plans

    (a)

     The Secretary shall invite the State energy agency of each State to submit, within 90 days after the effective date of the guidelines prescribed pursuant to [section 6372a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6372a], or such longer period as the Secretary may, for good cause, allow, a proposed State plan under this section for such State. Such plan shall include—

        (1) the results of preliminary energy audits conducted in accordance with the guidelines prescribed pursuant to [section 6372a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6372a/a/1], and an estimate of the energy savings that may result from the modification of maintenance and operating procedures in buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions;

        (2) a recommendation as to the types of technical assistance programs considered appropriate for buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions in such State, together with an estimate of the costs of carrying out such programs;

        (3) a program for identifying persons qualified to carry out technical assistance programs;

        (4) procedures for the coordination among technical assistance programs within any State and for coordination of programs authorized under this part with other State energy conservation programs, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The comma probably should be a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

        (5) a description of the policies and procedures to be followed in the allocation of funds among eligible applicants for technical assistance within such State, including procedures to insure that funds will be allocated among eligible applicants on the basis of relative need and including recommendations as to how priorities should be established between buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions, and among competing proposals taking into account such factors as cost, energy consumption, and energy savings;

        (6) procedures to assure that all grants for technical assistance provided under this part are expended in compliance with the requirements of an approved State plan for such State and in compliance with the requirements of this part (including requirements contained in rules promulgated under this part); and

        (7) policies and procedures designed to assure that financial assistance provided under this part in such State will be used to supplement, and not to supplant State, local, or other funds.

    (b) Each State plan submitted under this section shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Secretary not later than 60 days after receipt by the Secretary. If such plan meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall approve the plan. If a State plan submitted within the 90 day period specified in subsection (a) of this section has not been disapproved within the 60-day period following its receipt by the Secretary, such plan shall be treated as approved by the Secretary. A State energy agency may submit a new or amended plan at any time after the submission of the original plan if the agency obtains the consent of the Secretary.
