                (i) __In general.—__ 

                The manufacturer shall equip each gas, oil, and electric hot water boiler (other than a boiler equipped with a tankless domestic water heating coil) with automatic means for adjusting the temperature of the water supplied by the boiler to ensure that an incremental change in inferred heat load produces a corresponding incremental change in the temperature of water supplied.

                (ii) __Single input rate.—__ 

                For a boiler that fires at 1 input rate, the requirements of this subparagraph may be satisfied by providing an automatic means that allows the burner or heating element to fire only when the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

                (iii) __No inferred heat load.—__ 

                When there is no inferred heat load with respect to a hot water boiler, the automatic means described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall limit the temperature of the water in the boiler to not more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

                (iv) __Operation.—__ 

                A boiler described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be operable only when the automatic means described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) is installed.

            (C) __Exception.—__ 

            A boiler that is manufactured to operate without any need for electricity or any electric connection, electric gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, or electric devices shall not be required to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

                Not later than 2 years after a notice is issued under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall publish a final rule amending the standard for the product.

            (B) __New determination__ 

                Not later than 3 years after a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall make a new determination and publication under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1).

        (4) __Application to products__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to—

                (i) with respect to refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and kitchen ranges and ovens, such a product that is manufactured after the date that is 3 years after publication of the final rule establishing an applicable standard; and

                (ii) with respect to central air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment, and furnaces, such a product that is manufactured after the date that is 5 years after publication of the final rule establishing an applicable standard.

            (B) __Other new standards__ 

                A manufacturer shall not be required to apply new standards to a product with respect to which other new standards have been required during the prior 6-year period.

        (5) __Reports__ 

        The Secretary shall promptly submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate—

            (A) a progress report every 180 days on compliance with this section, including a specific plan to remedy any failures to comply with deadlines for action established under this section; and

            (B) all required reports to the Court or to any party to the Consent Decree in State of New York v Bodman, Consolidated Civil Actions No. 05 Civ. 7807 and No. 05 Civ. 7808.

    (n) __Petition for amended standard__ 

        (1) With respect to each covered product described in paragraphs (1) through (11), and in paragraphs (13) and (14) of [section 6292(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6292/a], any person may petition the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking to determine for a covered product if the standards contained either in the last final rule required under subsections (b) through (i) of this section or in a final rule published under this section should be amended.

        (2)

         The Secretary shall grant a petition if he finds that it contains evidence which, assuming no other evidence were considered, provides an adequate basis for amending the standards under the following criteria—

            (A) amended standards will result in significant conservation of energy;

            (B) amended standards are technologically feasible; and

            (C) amended standards are cost effective as described in subsection (o)(2)(B)(i)(II) of this section.

            The grant of a petition by the Secretary under this subsection creates no presumption with respect to the Secretary’s determination of any of the criteria in a rulemaking under this section.

        (3) __Notice of decision.—__ 

        Not later than 180 days after the date of receiving a petition, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of, and explanation for, the decision of the Secretary to grant or deny the petition.

        (4) __New or amended standards.—__ 

        Not later than 3 years after the date of granting a petition for new or amended standards, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register—

            (A) a final rule that contains the new or amended standards; or

            (B) a determination that no new or amended standards are necessary.

        (5)

         An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after—

            (A) the effective date of the previous amendment pursuant to this part; or

            (B) if the previous final rule published under this part did not amend the standard, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been in effect, except that in no case may an amended standard apply to products manufactured within 3 years (for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, general service fluorescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and kitchen ranges and ovens) or 5 years (for central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment and furnaces) after publication of the final rule establishing a standard.

    (o) __Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards__ 

        (1) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product.

        (2)

            (A) Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under this section for any type (or class) of covered product shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.

            (B)

                (i)

                 In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering—

                    (I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;

                    (II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

                    (III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

                    (IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

                    (V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

                    (VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and

                    (VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.

                (ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.

                (iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary’s determination of whether a standard is economically justified.

        (3)

         The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if—

            (A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to [section 6293 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6293] with respect to that type (or class) of product; or

            (B) the Secretary determines, by rule, that the establishment of such standard will not result in significant conservation of energy or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water, or that the establishment of such standard is not technologically feasible or economically justified.

            For purposes of [section 6297 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6297], a determination under subparagraph (B) with respect to any type (or class) of covered products shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for such type (or class).

        (4) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary’s finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary’s determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types (or classes).

        (5) The Secretary may set more than 1 energy conservation standard for products that serve more than 1 major function by setting 1 energy conservation standard for each major function.

        (6) __Regional standards for furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

            In any rulemaking to establish a new or amended standard, the Secretary may consider the establishment of separate standards by geographic region for furnaces (except boilers), central air conditioners, and heat pumps.

            (B) __National and regional standards.—__ 

                (i) __National standard.—__ 

                If the Secretary establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary shall establish a base national standard for the product.

                (ii) __Regional standards.—__ 

                If the Secretary establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary may establish more restrictive standards for the product by geographic region as follows:

                    (I) For furnaces, the Secretary may establish 1 additional standard that is applicable in a geographic region defined by the Secretary.

                    (II) For any cooling product, the Secretary may establish 1 or 2 additional standards that are applicable in 1 or 2 geographic regions as may be defined by the Secretary.

            (C) __Boundaries of geographic regions.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Subject to clause (ii), the boundaries of additional geographic regions established by the Secretary under this paragraph shall include only contiguous States.

                (ii) __Alaska and hawaii.—__ 

                The States of Alaska and Hawaii may be included under this paragraph in a geographic region that the States are not contiguous to.

                (iii) __Individual states.—__ 

                Individual States shall be placed only into a single region under this paragraph.

            (D) __Prerequisites.—__ 

            In establishing additional regional standards under this paragraph, the Secretary shall—

                (i)

                 establish additional regional standards only if the Secretary determines that—

                    (I) the establishment of additional regional standards will produce significant energy savings in comparison to establishing only a single national standard; and

                    (II) the additional regional standards are economically justified under this paragraph; and

                (ii) consider the impact of the additional regional standards on consumers, manufacturers, and other market participants, including product distributors, dealers, contractors, and installers.

            (E) __Application; effective date.—__ 

                (i) __Base national standard.—__ 

                Any base national standard established for a product under this paragraph shall—

                    (I) be the minimum standard for the product; and

                    (II) apply to all products manufactured or imported into the United States on and after the effective date for the standard.

                (ii) __Regional standards.—__ 

                Any additional and more restrictive regional standard established for a product under this paragraph shall apply to any such product installed on or after the effective date of the standard in States in which the Secretary has designated the standard to apply.

            (F) __Continuation of regional standards.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                In any subsequent rulemaking for any product for which a regional standard has been previously established, the Secretary shall determine whether to continue the establishment of separate regional standards for the product.

                (ii) __Regional standard no longer appropriate.—__ 

                Except as provided in clause (iii), if the Secretary determines that regional standards are no longer appropriate for a product, beginning on the effective date of the amended standard for the product—

                    (I) there shall be 1 base national standard for the product with Federal enforcement; and

                    (II) State authority for enforcing a regional standard for the product shall terminate.

                (iii) __Regional standard appropriate but standard or region changed.—__ 

                    (I) __State no longer contained in region.—__ 

                    Subject to subclause (III), if a State is no longer contained in a region in which a regional standard that is more stringent than the base national standard applies, the authority of the State to enforce the regional standard shall terminate.

                    (II) __Standard or region revised so that existing regional standard equals base national standard.—__ 

                    If the Secretary revises a base national standard for a product or the geographic definition of a region so that an existing regional standard for a State is equal to the revised base national standard—

                        (aa) the authority of the State to enforce the regional standard shall terminate on the effective date of the revised base national standard; and

                        (bb) the State shall be subject to the revised base national standard.

                    (III) __Standard or region revised so that existing regional standard equals base national standard.—__ 

                    If the Secretary revises a base national standard for a product or the geographic definition of a region so that the standard for a State is lower than the previously approved regional standard, the State may continue to enforce the previously approved standard level.

                (iv) __Waiver of federal preemption.—__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph diminishes the authority of a State to enforce a State regulation for which a waiver of Federal preemption has been granted under [section 6297(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6297/d].

            (G) __Enforcement.—__ 

                (i) __Base national standard.—__ 

                    (I) __In general.—__ 

                    The Secretary shall enforce any base national standard.

                    (II) __Trade association certification programs.—__ 

                    In enforcing the base national standard, the Secretary shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, national standard nationally recognized certification programs of trade associations.

                (ii) __Regional standards.—__ 

                    (I) __Enforcement plan.—__ 

                    Not later than 90 days after the date of the issuance of a final rule that establishes a regional standard, the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to develop and implement an effective enforcement plan for regional standards for the products that are covered by the final rule.

                    (II) __Responsible entities.—__ 

                    Any rules regarding enforcement of a regional standard shall clearly specify which entities are legally responsible for compliance with the standards and for making any required information or labeling disclosures.

                    (III) __Final rule.—__ 

                    Not later than 15 months after the date of the issuance of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary shall promulgate a final rule covering enforcement of regional standards for the product.

                    (IV) __Incorporation by states and localities.—__ 

                    A State or locality may incorporate any Federal regional standard into State or local building codes or State appliance standards.

                    (V) __State enforcement.—__ 

                    A State agency may seek enforcement of a Federal regional standard in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction.

            (H) __Information disclosure.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Not later than 90 days after the date of the publication of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product, the Federal Trade Commission shall undertake a rulemaking to determine the appropriate 1 or more methods for disclosing information so that consumers, distributors, contractors, and installers can easily determine whether a specific piece of equipment that is installed in a specific building is in conformance with the regional standard that applies to the building.

                (ii) __Methods.—__ 

                A method of disclosing information under clause (i) may include—

                    (I) modifications to the Energy Guide label; or

                    (II) other methods that make it easy for consumers and installers to use and understand at the point of installation.

                (iii) __Completion of rulemaking.—__ 

                The rulemaking shall be completed not later 15 months after the date of the publication of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product.

    (p) __Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards__ 

    Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:

        (1) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.

        (2)

         After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with [section 6306 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6306], afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including—

            (A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (o)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (o)(4) of this section;

            (B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;

            (C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and

            (D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.

        (3) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.

        (4) __Direct final rules.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

            On receipt of a statement that is submitted jointly by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view (including representatives of manufacturers of covered products, States, and efficiency advocates), as determined by the Secretary, and contains recommendations with respect to an energy or water conservation standard—

                (i) if the Secretary determines that the recommended standard contained in the statement is in accordance with subsection (o) or [section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6313/a/6/B], as applicable, the Secretary may issue a final rule that establishes an energy or water conservation standard and is published simultaneously with a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes a new or amended energy or water conservation standard that is identical to the standard established in the final rule to establish the recommended standard (referred to in this paragraph as a “direct final rule”); or

                (ii) if the Secretary determines that a direct final rule cannot be issued based on the statement, the Secretary shall publish a notice of the determination, together with an explanation of the reasons for the determination.

            (B) __Public comment.—__ 

            The Secretary shall solicit public comment for a period of at least 110 days with respect to each direct final rule issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A)(i).

            (C) __Withdrawal of direct final rules.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Not later than 120 days after the date on which a direct final rule issued under subparagraph (A)(i) is published in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall withdraw the direct final rule if—

                    (I) the Secretary receives 1 or more adverse public comments relating to the direct final rule under subparagraph (B)(i)  <sup>\[5\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 5 So in original. Probably should be “subparagraph (A)(i)”. </sup></sup>  or any alternative joint recommendation; and

                    (II) based on the rulemaking record relating to the direct final rule, the Secretary determines that such adverse public comments or alternative joint recommendation may provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule under subsection (o), [section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6313/a/6/B], or any other applicable law.

                (ii) __Action on withdrawal.—__ 

                On withdrawal of a direct final rule under clause (i), the Secretary shall—

                    (I) proceed with the notice of proposed rulemaking published simultaneously with the direct final rule as described in subparagraph (A)(i); and

                    (II) publish in the Federal Register the reasons why the direct final rule was withdrawn.

                (iii) __Treatment of withdrawn direct final rules.—__ 

                A direct final rule that is withdrawn under clause (i) shall not be considered to be a final rule for purposes of subsection (o).

            (D) __Effect of paragraph.—__ 

            Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the Secretary to issue a direct final rule based solely on receipt of more than 1 statement containing recommended standards relating to the direct final rule.

    (q) __Special rule for certain types or classes of products__ 

        (1)

         A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group—

            (A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or

            (B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).

            In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.

        (2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.

    (r) __Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements__ 

        Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with [section 6293 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6293] and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.

    (s) __Determination of compliance with standards__ 

        Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under [section 6293 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6293].

    (t) __Small manufacturer exemption__ 

        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.

        (2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.

    (u) __Battery charger and external power supply electric energy consumption__ 

        (1)

            (A) Not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall, after providing notice and an opportunity for comment, prescribe, by rule, definitions and test procedures for the power use of battery chargers and external power supplies.

            (B)

             In establishing the test procedures under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—

                (i) consider existing definitions and test procedures used for measuring energy consumption in standby mode and other modes; and

                (ii) assess the current and projected future market for battery chargers and external power supplies.

            (C)

             The assessment under subparagraph (B)(ii) shall include—

                (i) estimates of the significance of potential energy savings from technical improvements to battery chargers and external power supplies; and

                (ii) suggested product classes for energy conservation standards.

            (D) Not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall hold a scoping workshop to discuss and receive comments on plans for developing energy conservation standards for energy use for battery chargers and external power supplies.

            (E) __External power supplies and battery chargers.—__ 

                (i) __Energy conservation standards.—__ 

                    (I) __External power supplies.—__ 

                    Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that determines whether energy conservation standards shall be issued for external power supplies or classes of external power supplies.

                    (II) __Battery chargers.—__ 

                    Not later than July 1, 2011, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that prescribes energy conservation standards for battery chargers or classes of battery chargers or determine that no energy conservation standard is technically feasible and economically justified.

    (ii)

     For each product class, any energy conservation standards issued under clause (i) shall be set at the lowest level of energy use that—

        (I)

         meets the criteria and procedures of subsections (o), (p), (q), (r), (s), and (t) of this section; and

            (II) would result in significant overall annual energy savings, considering standby mode and other operating modes.

    (2) The Secretary and the Administrator shall collaborate and develop programs (including programs under [section 6294a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6294a] and other voluntary industry agreements or codes of conduct) that are designed to reduce standby mode energy use.

    (3) __Efficiency standards for class a external power supplies.—__ 

        (A) __In general.—__ 

        Subject to subparagraphs (B) through (E), a class A external power supply manufactured on or after the later of July 1, 2008, or December 19, 2007, shall meet the following standards:
