        (1) an assessment of the feasibility of establishing a State energy conservation goal, which goal shall consist of a reduction, as a result of the implementation of the State energy conservation plan described in this section, of 5 percent or more in the total amount of energy consumed in such State in the year 1980 from the projected energy consumption for such State in the year 1980, and

        (2) a proposal by such State for the development of a State energy conservation plan to achieve such goal.

    (b) __Guidelines__ 

    The Secretary shall, by rule, within 6 months after December 22, 1975, prescribe guidelines with respect to measures required to be included in, and guidelines for the development, modification, and funding of, State energy conservation plans. The Secretary shall invite the Governor of each State to submit, within 5 months after the effective date of such guidelines, a report. Such report shall include—

        (1) a proposed State energy conservation plan designed to result in scheduled progress toward, and achievement of, the State energy conservation goal of such State; and
