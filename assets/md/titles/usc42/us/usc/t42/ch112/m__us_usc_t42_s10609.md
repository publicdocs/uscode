                    (I) In the event that a United States person has an eligible claim that exceeds $20,000,000, the Special Master shall treat that claim as if it were for $20,000,000 for purposes of this section.

                    (III) In the event that a United States person, or the immediate family member of such person, has an eligible claim under this section and has received an award or an award determination under section 405 of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act ([49 U.S.C. 40101][/us/usc/t49/s40101] note), the amount of compensation to which such person, or the immediate family member of such person, was determined to be entitled under section 405 of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act ([49 U.S.C. 40101][/us/usc/t49/s40101] note) shall be considered controlling for the purposes of this section, notwithstanding any compensatory damages amounts such person, or immediate family member of such person, is deemed eligible for or entitled to pursuant to a final judgment described in subsection (c)(2)(A).

                (i) Any applicant with an eligible claim described in subsection (c)(2) who has received, or is entitled or scheduled to receive, any payment that is equal to, or in excess of, 30 percent of the total compensatory damages owed to such applicant on the applicant’s claim from any source other than this Fund shall not receive any payment from the Fund until such time as all other eligible applicants have received from the Fund an amount equal to 30 percent of the compensatory damages awarded to those applicants pursuant to their final judgments or to claims under subsection (c)(2)(B) or (c)(2)(C). For purposes of calculating the pro rata amounts for these payments, the Special Master shall not include the total compensatory damages for applicants excluded from payment by this subparagraph.

                (ii) To the extent that an applicant with an eligible claim has received less than 30 percent of the compensatory damages owed that applicant under a final judgment or claim described in subsection (c)(2) from any source other than this Fund, such applicant may apply to the Special Master for the difference between the percentage of compensatory damages the applicant has received from other sources and the percentage of compensatory damages to be awarded other eligible applicants from the Fund.

            (B) __Rights retained__ 

                To the extent amounts of damages remain unpaid and outstanding following any payments made under this subsection, each applicant shall retain that applicant’s creditor rights in any unpaid and outstanding amounts of the judgment, including any prejudgment or post-judgment interest, or punitive damages, awarded by the United States district court pursuant to a judgment.
