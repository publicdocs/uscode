 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 5106c of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5106c], referred to in text, was in the original “section 109 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act”, meaning [section 109 of Pub. L. 93–247][/us/pl/93/247/s109], and was translated as reading section 107 of that act to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 109 as section 107 by [section 113(a)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 104–235][/us/pl/104/235/s113/a/1/B], title I, Oct. 3, 1996, [110 Stat. 3079][/us/stat/110/3079].
