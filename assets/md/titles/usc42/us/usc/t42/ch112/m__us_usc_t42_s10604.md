    (b) __Recordkeeping__ 

        Each recipient of sums under this chapter shall keep such records as the Director shall prescribe, including records that fully disclose the amount and disposition by such recipient of such sums, the total cost of the undertaking for which such sums are used, and that portion of the cost of the undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.

    (c) __Access of Director to books and records for purpose of audit and examination__ 

        The Director shall have access, for purpose of audit and examination, to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient of sums under this chapter that, in the opinion of the Director, may be related to the expenditure of funds received under this chapter.

    (d) __Revealing research or statistical information; prohibition; immunity from legal proceedings; permission; admission of information as evidence__ 

        Except as otherwise provided by Federal law, no officer or employee of the Federal Government, and no recipient of sums under this chapter, shall use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished under this chapter by any person and identifiable to any specific private person for any purpose other than the purpose for which such information was obtained in accordance with this chapter. Such information, and any copy of such information, shall be immune from legal process and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding.

    (e) __Discrimination prohibited__ 

        No person shall on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or sex be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination under, or denied employment in connection with, any undertaking funded in whole or in part with sums made available under this chapter.

    (f) __Failure to comply with provisions; notice and hearing; power of Director__ 

    If, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record, the Director finds that a State has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter or a rule, regulation, guideline, or procedure issued under this chapter, or an application submitted in accordance with this chapter or the provisions of any other applicable law, the Director shall—

        (1) terminate payments to such State;

The Director may include in such report recommendations for legislation to improve this chapter.

    (h) __Maintenance of effort__ 

        Each entity receiving sums made available under this chapter for administrative purposes shall certify that such sums will not be used to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the amount of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds, be made available for these purposes.
