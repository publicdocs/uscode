            Except as provided in paragraph (4), from the amount available under paragraph (2)(B) for each fiscal year, a State shall be allotted an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount appropriated for such fiscal year as the population of the State that is under the age of 21 bears to the population of all States that is under the age of 21.
