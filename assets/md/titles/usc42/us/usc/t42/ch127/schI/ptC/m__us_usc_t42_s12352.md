## § 12352. “Family resource and support programs” defined

    As used in this part, the term “family resource and support programs” means community-based services that offer sustained assistance to families at various stages in their development. Such services shall promote parental competencies and behaviors that will lead to the healthy and positive personal development of parents and children through—

    (1) the provision of assistance to build family skills and assist parents in improving their capacities to be supportive and nurturing parents;

    (2) the provision of assistance to families to enable such families to use other formal and informal resources and opportunities for assistance that are available within the communities of such families; and

    (3) the creation of supportive networks to enhance the childrearing capacity of parents and assist in compensating for the increased social isolation and vulnerability of families.
