## § 12373. Conference administration

    (a) __Administration__ 

    For purposes of carrying out this subchapter, the Secretary shall—

        (1) request the cooperation and assistance of the heads of such other Federal departments and agencies as may be appropriate;

        (2) furnish all reasonable assistance to State agencies administering programs related to children, youth and families, and to other appropriate organizations, to enable them to organize and conduct conferences in conjunction with the Conference;

        (3) prepare and make available for public comment a proposed agenda for the Conference which reflects, to the greatest extent possible, the major issues facing children, youth, and families consistent with subsection (a) of this section;

        (4) prepare and make available background materials which the Secretary deems necessary for the use of delegates to the Conference; and

        (5) engage such additional personnel as may be necessary to carry out this section without regard to provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, and without regard to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates.

    (b) __Duties__ 

    The Secretary shall, in carrying out the Secretary’s responsibilities and functions under this section, ensure that—

        (1) the conferences under subsection (a)(2) of this section will be conducted so as to ensure broad participation of young individuals;

        (2) the proposed agenda for the Conference under subsection (a)(3) of this section is published in the Federal Register not less than 180 days before the beginning of the Conference and the proposed agenda is open for public comment for a period of not less than 60 days;

        (3) the final agenda for the Conference, taking into consideration the comments received under paragraph (2), is published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the chief executive officers of the States not later than 30 days after the close of the public comment period provided for under paragraph (2);

        (4) the personnel engaged under subsection (a)(5) of this section shall be fairly balanced in terms of points of views represented and shall be appointed without regard to political affiliation or previous partisan activities;

        (5) the recommendations of the Conference are not inappropriately influenced by any appointing authority or by any special interest, but will instead be the result of the independent judgment of the Conference; and

        (6) to the extent practicable, current and adequate statistical data (including decennial census data) and other information on the well-being of young individuals in the United States are readily available, in advance of the Conference, to the delegates of the Conference, together with such information as may be necessary to evaluate Federal programs and policies relating to children and youth. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary may make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public agencies and nonprofit private organizations.
