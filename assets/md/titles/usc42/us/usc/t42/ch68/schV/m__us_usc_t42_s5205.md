## § 5205. Disaster grant closeout procedures

    (a) __Statute of limitations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), no administrative action to recover any payment made to a State or local government for disaster or emergency assistance under this chapter shall be initiated in any forum after the date that is 3 years after the date of transmission of the final expenditure report for the disaster or emergency.

        (2) __Fraud exception__ 

            The limitation under paragraph (1) shall apply unless there is evidence of civil or criminal fraud.

    (b) __Rebuttal of presumption of record maintenance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In any dispute arising under this section after the date that is 3 years after the date of transmission of the final expenditure report for the disaster or emergency, there shall be a presumption that accounting records were maintained that adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially assisted activities.

        (2) __Affirmative evidence__ 

            The presumption described in paragraph (1) may be rebutted only on production of affirmative evidence that the State or local government did not maintain documentation described in that paragraph.

        (3) __Inability to produce documentation__ 

            The inability of the Federal, State, or local government to produce source documentation supporting expenditure reports later than 3 years after the date of transmission of the final expenditure report shall not constitute evidence to rebut the presumption described in paragraph (1).

        (4) __Right of access__ 

            The period during which the Federal, State, or local government has the right to access source documentation shall not be limited to the required 3-year retention period referred to in paragraph (3), but shall last as long as the records are maintained.

    (c) __Binding nature of grant requirements__ 

    A State or local government shall not be liable for reimbursement or any other penalty for any payment made under this chapter if—

        (1) the payment was authorized by an approved agreement specifying the costs;

        (2) the costs were reasonable; and

        (3) the purpose of the grant was accomplished.
