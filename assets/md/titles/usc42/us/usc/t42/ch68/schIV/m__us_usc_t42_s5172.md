            (B) __Cost estimation procedures__ 

                (i) __In general__

            (B) __Actual cost less than estimated cost__ 

                (i) __Greater than or equal to floor percentage of estimated cost__ 

                    In any case in which the actual cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing a facility under this section is less than 100 percent of the cost estimated under paragraph (1), but is greater than or equal to the floor percentage established under paragraph (3) of the cost estimated under paragraph (1), the State or local government or person receiving funds under this section shall use the excess funds to carry out cost-effective activities that reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, or suffering from a major disaster.

                (ii) __Less than floor percentage of estimated cost__ 

                    In any case in which the actual cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing a facility under this section is less than the floor percentage established under paragraph (3) of the cost estimated under paragraph (1), the State or local government or person receiving assistance under this section shall reimburse the President in the amount of the difference.

            (C) __No effect on appeals process__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph affects any right of appeal under [section 5189a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5189a].
