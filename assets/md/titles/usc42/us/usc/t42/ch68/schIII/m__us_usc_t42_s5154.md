## § 5154. Insurance

    (a) __Applicants for replacement of damaged facilities__ 

        (1) __Compliance with certain regulations__ 

            An applicant for assistance under [section 5172 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5172] (relating to repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities), [section 5189 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5189] (relating to simplified procedure) or [section 3149(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3149/c/2] shall comply with regulations prescribed by the President to assure that, with respect to any property to be replaced, restored, repaired, or constructed with such assistance, such types and extent of insurance will be obtained and maintained as may be reasonably available, adequate, and necessary, to protect against future loss to such property.

        (2) __Determination__ 

            In making a determination with respect to availability, adequacy, and necessity under paragraph (1), the President shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified to him as reasonable by the appropriate State insurance commissioner responsible for regulation of such insurance.

    (b) __Maintenance of insurance__ 

        No applicant for assistance under [section 5172 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5172] (relating to repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities), [section 5189 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5189] (relating to simplified procedure), or [section 3149(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3149/c/2] may receive such assistance for any property or part thereof for which the applicant has previously received assistance under this chapter unless all insurance required pursuant to this section has been obtained and maintained with respect to such property. The requirements of this subsection may not be waived under [section 5141 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5141].

    (c) __State acting as self-insurer__ 

        A State may elect to act as a self-insurer with respect to any or all of the facilities owned by the State. Such an election, if declared in writing at the time of acceptance of assistance under section 5172 or 5189 of this title or [section 3149(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3149/c/2] or subsequently and accompanied by a plan for self-insurance which is satisfactory to the President, shall be deemed compliance with subsection (a) of this section. No such self-insurer may receive assistance under section 5172 or 5189 of this title for any property or part thereof for which it has previously received assistance under this chapter, to the extent that insurance for such property or part thereof would have been reasonably available.
