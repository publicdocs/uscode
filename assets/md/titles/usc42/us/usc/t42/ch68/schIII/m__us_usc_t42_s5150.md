    (a) __Contracts or agreements with private entities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the expenditure of Federal funds for debris clearance, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other major disaster or emergency assistance activities which may be carried out by contract or agreement with private organizations, firms, or individuals, preference shall be given, to the extent feasible and practicable, to those organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster or emergency.

        (2) __Construction__ 

            This subsection shall not be considered to restrict the use of Department of Defense resources under this chapter in the provision of assistance in a major disaster.

        (3) __Specific geographic area__ 

            In carrying out this section, a contract or agreement may be set aside for award based on a specific geographic area.

    (b) __Implementation__ 

        (1) __Contracts not to entities in area__ 

            Any expenditure of Federal funds for debris clearance, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other major disaster or emergency assistance activities which may be carried out by contract or agreement with private organizations, firms, or individuals, not awarded to an organization, firm, or individual residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster shall be justified in writing in the contract file.

        (2) __Transition__ 

            Following the declaration of an emergency or major disaster, an agency performing response, relief, and reconstruction activities shall transition work performed under contracts in effect on the date on which the President declares the emergency or major disaster to organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business primarily in any area affected by the major disaster or emergency, unless the head of such agency determines that it is not feasible or practicable to do so.

        (3) __Formulation of requirements__ 

            The head of a Federal agency, as feasible and practicable, shall formulate appropriate requirements to facilitate compliance with this section.

    (c) __Prior contracts__
