            (F) in determining eligible costs under [section 5172 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5172], the Administrator shall, at the applicant’s request, consider properly conducted and certified cost estimates prepared by professionally licensed engineers (mutually agreed upon by the Administrator and the applicant), to the extent that such estimates comply with applicable regulations, policy, and guidance.

        (2) carry out the alternative procedures under this section as a pilot program.

    (g) __Overtime payments__
