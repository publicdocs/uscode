## § 17541. Federal prisoner reentry initiative

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, conduct the following activities to establish a Federal prisoner reentry initiative:

        (1)

         The establishment of a Federal prisoner reentry strategy to help prepare prisoners for release and successful reintegration into the community, including, at a minimum, that the Bureau of Prisons—

            (A) assess each prisoner’s skill level (including academic, vocational, health, cognitive, interpersonal, daily living, and related reentry skills) at the beginning of the term of imprisonment of that prisoner to identify any areas in need of improvement prior to reentry;

            (B) generate a skills development plan for each prisoner to monitor skills enhancement and reentry readiness throughout incarceration;

            (C) determine program assignments for prisoners based on the areas of need identified through the assessment described in subparagraph (A);

            (D) ensure that priority is given to the reentry needs of high-risk populations, such as sex offenders, career criminals, and prisoners with mental health problems;

            (E) coordinate and collaborate with other Federal agencies and with State, Tribal, and local criminal justice agencies, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations to help effectuate a seamless reintegration of prisoners into communities;

            (F) collect information about a prisoner’s family relationships, parental responsibilities, and contacts with children to help prisoners maintain important familial relationships and support systems during incarceration and after release from custody; and

            (G) provide incentives for prisoner participation in skills development programs.

        (2)

         Incentives for a prisoner who participates in reentry and skills development programs which may, at the discretion of the Director, include—

            (A) the maximum allowable period in a community confinement facility; and

            (B) such other incentives as the Director considers appropriate (not including a reduction of the term of imprisonment).

    (b) __Identification and release assistance for Federal prisoners__ 

        (1) __Obtaining identification__ 

            The Director shall assist prisoners in obtaining identification (including a social security card, driver’s license or other official photo identification, or birth certificate) prior to release.

        (2) __Assistance developing release plan__ 

            At the request of a direct-release prisoner, a representative of the United States Probation System shall, prior to the release of that prisoner, help that prisoner develop a release plan.

        (3) __Direct-release prisoner defined__ 

            In this section, the term “direct-release prisoner” means a prisoner who is scheduled for release and will not be placed in prerelease custody.

    (c) __Improved reentry procedures for Federal prisoners__ 

    The Attorney General shall take such steps as are necessary to modify the procedures and policies of the Department of Justice with respect to the transition of offenders from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to the community—

        (1) to enhance case planning and implementation of reentry programs, policies, and guidelines;

        (2) to improve such transition to the community, including placement of such individuals in community corrections facilities; and

        (3) to foster the development of collaborative partnerships with stakeholders at the national, State, and local levels to facilitate the exchange of information and the development of resources to enhance opportunities for successful offender reentry.

        (1) __Omitted__ 

        (2) __Measuring the removal of obstacles to reentry__ 

            (A) __Coding required__

            (B) __Tracking__ 

                In carrying out this paragraph, the Director shall quantitatively track the progress in responding to the reentry needs and deficits of individual inmates.

            (C) __Annual report__ 

                On an annual basis, the Director shall prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives a report that documents the progress of the Bureau of Prisons in responding to the reentry needs and deficits of inmates.

            (D) __Evaluation__ 

            The Director shall ensure that—

                (i) the performance of each institution within the Bureau of Prisons in enhancing skills and resources to assist in reentry is measured and evaluated using recognized measurements; and

Such statistics shall be compiled separately for each such fiscal year.

                (ii) __Scope__ 

                    A report under this paragraph is not required to include statistics for a fiscal year that begins before April 9, 2008.

            (B) __Measure used__ 

                In preparing the reports required by subparagraph (A), the Director shall, in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, select a measure for recidivism (such as rearrest, reincarceration, or any other valid, evidence-based measure) that the Director considers appropriate and that is consistent with the research undertaken by the Bureau of Justice Statistics under [section 17551(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17551/b/6].

            (C) __Goals__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    After the Director submits the first report required by subparagraph (A), the Director shall establish goals for reductions in recidivism rates and shall work to attain those goals.

                (ii) __Contents__ 

                The goals established under clause (i) shall use the relative reductions in recidivism measured for the fiscal year covered by the first report required by subparagraph (A) as a baseline rate, and shall include—

                    (I) a 5-year goal to increase, at a minimum, the baseline relative reduction rate of recidivism by 2 percent; and

                    (II) a 10-year goal to increase, at a minimum, the baseline relative reduction rate of recidivism by 5 percent within 10 fiscal years.

        (4) __Format__ 

            Any written information that the Bureau of Prisons provides to inmates for reentry planning purposes shall use common terminology and language.

        (5) __Medical care__ 

            The Bureau of Prisons shall provide the United States Probation and Pretrial Services System with relevant information on the medical care needs and the mental health treatment needs of inmates scheduled for release from custody. The United States Probation and Pretrial Services System shall take this information into account when developing supervision plans in an effort to address the medical care and mental health care needs of such individuals. The Bureau of Prisons shall provide inmates with a sufficient amount of all necessary medications (which will normally consist of, at a minimum, a 2-week supply of such medications) upon release from custody.

    (e) __Encouragement of employment of former prisoners__ 

        The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall take such steps as are necessary to educate employers and the one-stop partners and one-stop operators (as such terms are defined in [section 3102 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s3102]) that provide services at any center operated under a one-stop delivery system established under [section 3151(e) of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s3151/e] regarding incentives (including the Federal bonding program of the Department of Labor and tax credits) for hiring former Federal, State, or local prisoners.
