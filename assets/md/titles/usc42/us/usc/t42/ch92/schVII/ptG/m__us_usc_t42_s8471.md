    (a) __Compliance with applicable environmental requirements__ 

        Except as provided in [section 8374 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8374], nothing in this chapter shall be construed as permitting any existing or new electric powerplant to delay or avoid compliance with applicable environmental requirements.

    (b) __Local environmental requirements__ 

    In the case of any new or existing facility—

        (1) which is subject to any prohibition under this chapter, and

        (2) which is also subject to any requirement of any local environmental requirement which may be stricter than any Federal or State environmental requirement,

        the existence of such local requirement shall not be construed to affect the validity or applicability of such prohibition to such facility, except to the extent provided under section 8322(b) or [section 8352(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8352/b]; and the existence of such prohibition shall not be construed to preempt such local requirement with respect to that facility.
