    This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), was in the original “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 95–620][/us/pl/95/620], Nov. 9, 1978, [92 Stat. 3289][/us/stat/92/3289], known as the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which is classified principally to this chapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1987—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 100–42][/us/pl/100/42] struck out subsec. (c) which read as follows: “No person shall be subject to any penalty under this part with respect to the operation of any powerplant in excess of that allowed by an exemption granted on the basis of the operation of such powerplant as a peakload powerplant if it is demonstrated to the Secretary that such operation was necessary to meet peakload demand and that other peakload powerplants within the same system as such powerplant—

    “(1) were unavailable for service—

    “(A) due to unit or system outages; or

    “(B) because operation of such other powerplants would result in their exceeding the hours of operation allowed under an exemption; and

    “(2) have not been operated other than to meet peakload demand.”
