## § 4391. Congressional statement of findings

    The Congress finds that there is general agreement that air, water, and other common environmental pollution may be hazardous to the health of individuals resident in the United States, but that despite the existence of various research papers and other technical reports on the health hazards of such pollution, there is no authoritative source of information about (1) the nature and gravity of these hazards, (2) the availability of medical and other assistance to persons affected by such pollution, especially when such pollution reaches emergency levels, and (3) the measures, other than those relating solely to abatement of the pollution, that may be taken to avoid or reduce the effects of such pollution on the health of individuals.
