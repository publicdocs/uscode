        The Secretary shall require that each application include reasonable assurances that the applicant will own or have control of a site for the proposed project not later than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning upon notification of an award for grant assistance, unless the application proposes providing supportive housing assistance under [section 11383(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11383/a/3] or housing that will eventually be owned or controlled by the families and individuals served. An applicant may obtain ownership or control of a suitable site different from the site specified in the application.

            (C) they will establish policies and practices that are consistent with, and do not restrict the exercise of rights provided by, part B of subchapter VI \[[42 U.S.C. 11431][/us/usc/t42/s11431] et seq.\], and other laws relating to the provision of educational and related services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness;

        (6) to monitor and report to the Secretary the provision of matching funds as required by [section 11386d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386d];

        (7) to take the educational needs of children into account when families are placed in emergency or transitional shelter and will, to the maximum extent practicable, place families with children as close as possible to their school of origin so as not to disrupt such children’s education; and

        (8) to comply with such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish to carry out this part in an effective and efficient manner.

    (c) __Occupancy charge__ 

        Each homeless individual or family residing in a project providing supportive housing may be required to pay an occupancy charge in an amount determined by the recipient or project sponsor providing the project, which may not exceed the amount determined under [section 1437a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1437a/a].

        The Secretary shall, by regulation, require each recipient or project sponsor to provide for the participation of not less than 1 homeless individual or former homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policymaking entity of the recipient or project sponsor, to the extent that such entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding any project, supportive services, or assistance provided under this part. The Secretary may grant waivers to applicants unable to meet the requirement under the preceding sentence if the applicant agrees to otherwise consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making such policies and decisions.

    (f) __Limitation on use of funds__ 

        No assistance received under this part (or any State or local government funds used to supplement such assistance) may be used to replace other State or local funds previously used, or designated for use, to assist homeless persons.

    (g) __Termination of assistance__ 

        If an individual or family who receives assistance under this part (not including residents of an emergency shelter) from a recipient violates program requirements, the recipient may terminate assistance in accordance with a formal process established by the recipient that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving such assistance to due process of law, which may include a hearing.
