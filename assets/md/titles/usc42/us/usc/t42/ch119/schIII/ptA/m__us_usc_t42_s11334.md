        (1) The accounts of the National Board shall be audited annually in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants or independent licensed public accountants certified or licensed by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States. The audits shall be conducted at the place or places where the accounts of the National Board are normally kept. All books, accounts, financial records, reports, files, and all other papers, things, or property belonging to or in use by the National Board and necessary to facilitate the audits shall be made available to the person or persons conducting the audits, and full facilities for verifying transactions with any assets held by depositories, fiscal agents, and custodians shall be afforded to such person or persons.

Such report shall set forth the scope of the audit and include such statements as are necessary to present fairly the assets and liabilities of the National Board, surplus or deficit, with an analysis of the changes during the year, supplemented in reasonable detail by a statement of the income and expenses of the National Board during the year, and a statement of the application of funds, together with the opinion of the independent auditor of such statements.

    (b) __Access to records of recipients of assistance__ 

        (1) Each recipient of assistance under this subchapter shall keep such records as may be reasonably necessary to fully disclose the amount and the disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which such assistance is given or used, and the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.

        (2) The National Board, or any of its duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this subchapter.

    (c) __Authority of Comptroller General__ 

        The Comptroller General of the United States, or any of the duly authorized representatives of the Comptroller General, shall also have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the National Board and recipients for such purpose.
