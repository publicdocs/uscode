## § 11382. Continuum of care applications and grants

    (a) __Projects__ 

        The Secretary shall award grants, on a competitive basis, and using the selection criteria described in [section 11386a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386a], to carry out eligible activities under this part for projects that meet the program requirements under [section 11386 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386], either by directly awarding funds to project sponsors or by awarding funds to unified funding agencies.

    (b) __Notification of funding availability__ 

        The Secretary shall release a notification of funding availability for grants awarded under this part for a fiscal year not later than 3 months after the date of the enactment of the appropriate Act making appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for such fiscal year.

    (c) __Applications__ 

        (1) __Submission to the Secretary__ 

        To be eligible to receive a grant under subsection (a), a project sponsor or unified funding agency in a geographic area shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require, and containing such information as the Secretary determines necessary—

            (A) to determine compliance with the program requirements and selection criteria under this part; and

            (B) to establish priorities for funding projects in the geographic area.

        (2) __Announcement of awards__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall announce, within 5 months after the last date for the submission of applications described in this subsection for a fiscal year, the grants conditionally awarded under subsection (a) for that fiscal year.

            (B) __Transition__ 

                For a period of up to 2 years beginning after the effective date under section 1503 of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009, the Secretary shall announce, within 6 months after the last date for the submission of applications described in this subsection for a fiscal year, the grants conditionally awarded under subsection (a) for that fiscal year.

    (d) __Obligation, distribution, and utilization of funds__ 

        (1) __Requirements for obligation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Not later than 9 months after the announcement referred to in subsection (c)(2), each recipient or project sponsor shall meet all requirements for the obligation of those funds, including site control, matching funds, and environmental review requirements, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C).

            (B) __Acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction__ 

                Not later than 24 months after the announcement referred to in subsection (c)(2), each recipient or project sponsor seeking the obligation of funds for acquisition of housing, rehabilitation of housing, or construction of new housing for a grant announced under subsection (c)(2) shall meet all requirements for the obligation of those funds, including site control, matching funds, and environmental review requirements.

            (C) __Extensions__ 

                At the discretion of the Secretary, and in compelling circumstances, the Secretary may extend the date by which a recipient or project sponsor shall meet the requirements described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirements was delayed due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the recipient or project sponsor. Such factors may include difficulties in obtaining site control for a proposed project, completing the process of obtaining secure financing for the project, obtaining approvals from State or local governments, or completing the technical submission requirements for the project.

        (2) __Obligation__ 

            Not later than 45 days after a recipient or project sponsor meets the requirements described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall obligate the funds for the grant involved.

        (3) __Distribution__ 

        A recipient that receives funds through such a grant—

            (A) shall distribute the funds to project sponsors (in advance of expenditures by the project sponsors); and

            (B) shall distribute the appropriate portion of the funds to a project sponsor not later than 45 days after receiving a request for such distribution from the project sponsor.

        (4) __Expenditure of funds__ 

            The Secretary may establish a date by which funds made available through a grant announced under subsection (c)(2) for a homeless assistance project shall be entirely expended by the recipient or project sponsors involved. The date established under this paragraph shall not occur before the expiration of the 24-month period beginning on the date that funds are obligated for activities described under paragraphs  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph”. </sup></sup>  (1) or (2) of [section 11383(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11383/a]. The Secretary shall recapture the funds not expended by such date. The Secretary shall reallocate the funds for another homeless assistance and prevention project that meets the requirements of this part to be carried out, if possible and appropriate, in the same geographic area as the area served through the original grant.

    (e) __Renewal funding for unsuccessful applicants__ 

        The Secretary may renew funding for a specific project previously funded under this part that the Secretary determines meets the purposes of this part, and was included as part of a total application that met the criteria of subsection (c), even if the application was not selected to receive grant assistance. The Secretary may renew the funding for a period of not more than 1 year, and under such conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

    (f) __Considerations in determining renewal funding__ 

        When providing renewal funding for leasing, operating costs, or rental assistance for permanent housing, the Secretary shall make adjustments proportional to increases in the fair market rents in the geographic area.

    (g) __More than 1 application for a geographic area__ 

        If more than 1 collaborative applicant applies for funds for a geographic area, the Secretary shall award funds to the collaborative applicant with the highest score based on the selection criteria set forth in [section 11386a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386a].

    (h) __Appeals__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a timely appeal procedure for grant amounts awarded or denied under this part pursuant to a collaborative application or solo application for funding.

        (2) __Process__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that the procedure permits appeals submitted by entities carrying out homeless housing and services projects (including emergency shelters and homelessness prevention programs), and all other applicants under this part.

    (i) __Solo applicants__ 

        A solo applicant may submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under subsection (a) and be awarded such grant on the same basis as such grants are awarded to other applicants based on the criteria described in [section 11386a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386a], but only if the Secretary determines that the solo applicant has attempted to participate in the continuum of care process but was not permitted to participate in a reasonable manner. The Secretary may award such grants directly to such applicants in a manner determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.

    (j) __Flexibility to serve persons defined as homeless under other Federal laws__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A collaborative applicant may use not more than 10 percent of funds awarded under this part (continuum of care funding) for any of the types of eligible activities specified in paragraphs (1) through (7) of [section 11383(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11383/a] to serve families with children and youth defined as homeless under other Federal statutes, or homeless families with children and youth defined as homeless under [section 11302(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11302/a/6], but only if the applicant demonstrates that the use of such funds is of an equal or greater priority or is equally or more cost effective in meeting the overall goals and objectives of the plan submitted under [section 11386a(b)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11386a/b/1/B], especially with respect to children and unaccompanied youth.

        (2) __Limitations__ 

            The 10 percent limitation under paragraph (1) shall not apply to collaborative applicants in which the rate of homelessness, as calculated in the most recent point in time count, is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of total population.

        (3) __Treatment of certain populations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding [section 11302(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11302/a] and subject to subparagraph (B), funds awarded under this part may be used for eligible activities to serve unaccompanied youth and homeless families and children defined as homeless under [section 11302(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11302/a/6] only pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and such families and children shall not otherwise be considered as homeless for purposes of this part.

            (B) __At risk of homelessness__ 

                Subparagraph (A) may not be construed to prevent any unaccompanied youth and homeless families and children defined as homeless under [section 11302(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s11302/a/6] from qualifying for, and being treated for purposes of this part as, at risk of homelessness or from eligibility for any projects, activities, or services carried out using amounts provided under this part for which individuals or families that are at risk of homelessness are eligible.
