## § 5308. Guarantee and commitment to guarantee loans for acquisition of property

    (a) __Authority of Secretary; issuance of obligations by eligible public entities or designated public agencies; form, denomination, maturity, and conditions of notes or other obligations; percentage allocation requirements__ 

        The Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to guarantee and make commitments to guarantee, only to such extent or in such amounts as provided in appropriation Acts, the notes or other obligations issued by eligible public entities, or by public agencies designated by such eligible public entities, for the purposes of financing (1) acquisition of real property or the rehabilitation of real property owned by the eligible public entity (including such related expenses as the Secretary may permit by regulation); (2) housing rehabilitation; (3) economic development activities permitted under paragraphs (14), (15), and (17) of [section 5305(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5305/a]; (4) construction of housing by nonprofit organizations for homeownership under section 1437o(d)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title or title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987; (5) the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities (except for buildings for the general conduct of government); or (6) in the case of colonias (as such term is defined in section 916 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act), public works and site or other improvements. A guarantee under this section may be used to assist a grantee in obtaining financing only if the grantee has made efforts to obtain such financing without the use of such guarantee and cannot complete such financing consistent with the timely execution of the program plans without such guarantee. Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this section shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this section on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject only to the absence of qualified applicants or proposed activities and to the authority provided in this section, to the extent approved or provided in appropriation Acts, the Secretary shall enter into commitments to guarantee notes and obligations under this section with an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1993 and $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1994. Of the amount approved in any appropriation Act for guarantees under this section in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate 70 percent for guarantees for metropolitan cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes and 30 percent for guarantees for units of general local government in nonentitlement areas. The Secretary may waive the percentage requirements of the preceding sentence in any fiscal year only to the extent that there is an absence of qualified applicants or proposed activities from metropolitan cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes or units of general local government in nonentitlement areas.

    (b) __Prerequisites__ 

        No guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be made with respect to any note or other obligation if the issuer’s total outstanding notes or obligations guaranteed under this section (excluding any amount defeased under the contract entered into under subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section) would thereby exceed an amount equal to 5 times the amount of the grant approval for the issuer pursuant to section 5306 or 5307 of this title.

    (c) __Payment of principal, interest and costs__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, grants allocated to an issuer pursuant to this chapter (including program income derived therefrom) are authorized for use in the payment of principal and interest due (including such servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be specified in regulations of the Secretary) on the notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this section.

    (d) __Repayment contract; security; pledge by State__ 

        (1)

         To assure the repayment of notes or other obligations and charges incurred under this section and as a condition for receiving such guarantees, the Secretary shall require the issuer to—

            (B) pledge any grant for which the issuer may become eligible under this chapter; and

            (C) furnish, at the discretion of the Secretary, such other security as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary in making such guarantees, including increments in local tax receipts generated by the activities assisted under this chapter or dispositions proceeds from the sale of land or rehabilitated property.

        (2) To assist in assuring the repayment of notes or other obligations and charges incurred under this section, a State shall pledge any grant for which the State may become eligible under this chapter as security for notes or other obligations and charges issued under this section by any unit of general local government in a nonentitlement area in the State.

    (e) __Pledged grants for repayments__ 

        The Secretary is authorized, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, to apply grants pledged pursuant to paragraphs (1)(B) and (2) of subsection (d) of this section to any repayments due the United States as a result of such guarantees.

    (f) __Full faith and credit of United States pledged for payment; conclusiveness and validity of guarantee__ 

        The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this section. Any such guarantee made by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligations for such guarantee with respect to principal and interest, and the validity of any such guarantee so made shall be incontestable in the hands of a holder of the guaranteed obligations.

    (g) __Issuance of obligations by Secretary to Secretary of the Treasury to satisfy authorized guarantee obligations; establishment of maturities and rates of interest and purchase of obligations by Secretary of the Treasury__ 

        The Secretary may issue obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury in an amount outstanding at any one time sufficient to enable the Secretary to carry out his obligations under guarantees authorized by this section. The obligations issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any obligations of the Secretary issued under this section, and for such purposes is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchases of the Secretary’s obligations hereunder.

    (h) __Federal taxation of guaranteed obligations; grants to borrowing entity or agency of taxable obligations for net interest costs, etc.; limitation on amount of grant; assistance to issuer in hardship cases__ 

        Obligations guaranteed under this section shall be subject to Federal taxation as provided in subsection (j) of this section. The Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, grants, in such amounts as may be approved in appropriations Acts, to or on behalf of the issuing eligible public entity or public agency to cover not to exceed 30 per centum of the net interest cost (including such servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be specified in regulations of the Secretary) to the borrowing entity or agency of such obligations. The Secretary may also, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, assist the issuer of a note or other obligation guaranteed under this section in the payment of all or a portion of the principal and interest amount due under the note or other obligation, if the Secretary determines that the issuer is unable to pay the amount because of circumstances of extreme hardship beyond the control of the issuer.

    (i) __Omitted__ 

    (j) __Inclusion within gross income for purpose of chapter 1 of title 26 of interest paid on taxable obligations__
