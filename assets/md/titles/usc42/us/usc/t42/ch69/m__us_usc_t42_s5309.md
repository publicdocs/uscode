        When a matter is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or whenever he has reason to believe that a State government or unit of general local government is engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for such relief as may be appropriate, including injunctive relief.

    (d) __Waiver of race discrimination prohibitions regarding assistance to Hawaiian Home Lands__ 

        The provisions of this section and [section 5304(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5304/b/2] which relate to discrimination on the basis of race shall not apply to the provision of assistance by grantees under this chapter to the Hawaiian Home Lands.

    (e) __Equal access__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            In this subsection, the term “youth organization” means an organization described under part B of subtitle II of title 36 that is intended to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.

        (2) __In general__ 

            No State or unit of general local government that has a designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of assistance under this chapter shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise participate in that designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum.
