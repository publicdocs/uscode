## § 5318. Urban development action grants

    (a) __Authorization; purpose; amount__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to make urban development action grants to cities and urban counties which are experiencing severe economic distress to help stimulate economic development activity needed to aid in economic recovery. There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $225,000,000 for fiscal year 1988, and $225,000,000 for fiscal year 1989. Any amount appropriated under this subsection shall remain available until expended.

    (b) __Eligibility of cities and urban counties; criteria and standards; regulations__ 

        (1) Urban development action grants shall be made only to cities and urban counties which have, in the determination of the Secretary, demonstrated results in providing housing for low- and moderate-income persons and in providing equal opportunity in housing and employment for low- and moderate-income persons and members of minority groups. The Secretary shall issue regulations establishing criteria in accordance with the preceding sentence and setting forth minimum standards for determining the level of economic distress of cities and urban counties for eligibility for such grants. These standards shall take into account factors such as the age of housing; the extent of poverty; the extent of population lag; growth of per capita income; and the extent of unemployment, job lag, or surplus labor. Any city that has a population of less than 50,000 persons and is not the central city of a metropolitan area, and that was eligible for fiscal year 1983 under this paragraph for assistance under this section, shall continue to be eligible for such assistance until the Secretary revises the standards for eligibility for such cities under this paragraph and includes the extent of unemployment, job lag, or labor surplus as a standard of distress for such cities. The Secretary shall make such revision as soon as practicable following November 30, 1983.

        (2)

         A city or urban county which fails to meet the minimum standards established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be eligible for assistance under this section if it meets the requirements of the first sentence of such paragraph and—

            (A) in the case of a city with a population of fifty thousand persons or more or an urban county, contains an area (i) composed of one or more contiguous census tracts, enumeration districts, neighborhood statistics areas, or block groups, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, having at least a population of ten thousand persons or 10 per centum of the population of the city or urban county; (ii) in which at least 70 per centum of the residents have incomes below 80 per centum of the median income of the city or urban county; and (iii) in which at least 30 per centum of the residents have incomes below the national poverty level; or

            (B) in the case of a city with a population of less than fifty thousand persons, contains an area (i) composed of one or more contiguous census tracts, enumeration districts, neighborhood statistics areas, or block groups or other areas defined by the United States Bureau of the Census or for which data certified by the United States Bureau of the Census are available having at least a population of two thousand five hundred persons or 10 per centum of the population of the city, whichever is greater; (ii) in which at least 70 per centum of the residents have incomes below 80 per centum of the median income of the city; and (iii) in which at least 30 per centum of the residents have incomes below the national poverty level.

            The Secretary shall use up to, but not more than, 20 per centum of the funds appropriated for use in any fiscal year under this section for the purpose of making grants to cities and urban counties eligible under this paragraph.

    (c) __Applications; documentation of eligibility; proposed plan; assurance of notice and comment; assurance of consideration on historical landmarks__

        (1) in the case of an application for a grant under subsection (b)(2) of this section, include documentation of grant eligibility in accordance with the standards described in that subsection;

        (2) set forth the activities for which assistance is sought, including (A) an estimate of the costs and general location of the activities; (B) a summary of the public and private resources which are expected to be made available in connection with the activities, including how the activities will take advantage of unique opportunities to attract private investment; and (C) an analysis of the economic benefits which the activities are expected to produce;

The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to projects that do not have identified intended occupants.

        (2) __Projects with identified intended occupants__ 

        No assistance may be provided or utilized under this section for any project with identified intended occupants that is likely to facilitate—

                (ii) to the city, urban county, or identifiable community described in subsection (p) of this section, in which the project is located; or

            (B) an expansion of any such operation that results in a reduction of any such operation in any city, county, or community described in subparagraph (A)(i).

        (3) __Significant and adverse effect__ 

            The restrictions established in paragraph (2) shall not apply if the Secretary determines that the relocation or expansion does not significantly and adversely affect the employment or economic base of the city, county, or community from which the relocation or expansion occurs.

        (4) __Appeal of adverse determination__ 

            Following notice of intent to withhold, deny, or cancel assistance under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary shall provide a period of not less than 90 days in which the applicant can appeal to the Secretary the withholding, denial, or cancellation of assistance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, nothing in this section or in any legislative history related to the enactment of this section may be construed to permit an inference or conclusion that the policy of the Congress in the urban development action grant program is to facilitate the relocation of businesses from one area to another.

        (5) __Assistance for individuals adversely affected by prohibited relocations__ 

            (A) Any amount withdrawn by, recaptured by, or paid to the Secretary due to a violation (or a settlement of an alleged violation) of this subsection (or of any regulation issued or contractual provision entered into to carry out this subsection) by a project with identified intended occupants shall be made available by the Secretary as a grant to the city, county, or community described in subsection (p) of this section, from which the operation of an industrial or commercial plant or facility or other business establishment relocated or in which the operation was reduced.

            (B)

                (i) Any amount made available under this paragraph shall be used by the grantee to assist individuals who were employed by the operation involved prior to the relocation or reduction and whose employment or terms of employment were adversely affected by the relocation or reduction. The assistance shall include job training, job retraining, and job placement.

                (ii) If any amount made available to a grantee under this paragraph is more than is required to provide assistance under clause (i), the grantee shall use the excess amount to carry out community development activities eligible under [section 5305(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5305/a].

            (C)

                (i) The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable to any amount withdrawn by, recaptured by, or paid to the Secretary under this section, including any amount withdrawn, recaptured, or paid before the effective date of this paragraph.

        (7) __Regulations__ 

            Not later than 60 days after February 5, 1988, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection. Such regulations shall include specific criteria to be used by the Secretary in determining whether there is a significant and adverse effect under paragraph (3).

    (i) __Minimum percentage of funds to be allocated to certain noncentral cities; application by consortia of cities of less than 50,000 population__ 

        Not less than 25 per centum of the funds made available for grants under this section shall be used for cities with populations of less than fifty thousand persons which are not central cities of a metropolitan statistical area. The Secretary shall encourage cooperation by geographically proximate cities of less than 50,000 population by permitting consortia of such cities, which may also include county governments that are not urban counties, to apply for grants on behalf of a city that is otherwise eligible for assistance under this section. Any grants awarded to such consortia shall be administered in compliance with eligibility requirements applicable to individual cities.

    (j) __Grant contingent on factors related to non-Federal funds__ 

        A grant may be made under this section only where the Secretary determines that there is a strong probability that (1) the non-Federal investment in the project would not be made without the grant, and (2) the grant would not substitute for non-Federal funds which are otherwise available to the project.

    (k) __Duty of Secretary to minimize amount__ 

        In making grants under this section, the Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary deems appropriate to assure that the amount of the grant provided is the least necessary to make the project feasible.

    (l) __Power of Secretary to waive requirement that town or township be closely settled__ 

        For purposes of this section, the Secretary may reduce or waive the requirement in [section 5302(a)(5)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5302/a/5/B/ii] that a town or township be closely settled.

        In the case of any application which identifies any property in accordance with subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section, the Secretary may not commit funds with respect to an approved application unless the applicant has certified to the Secretary that the appropriate State historic preservation officer and the Secretary of the Interior have been provided an opportunity to take action in accordance with the provisions of [section 5320(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5320/b].

        An unincorporated portion of an urban county that is approved by the Secretary as an identifiable community for purposes of this section is eligible for a grant under subsection (b)(2) of this section if such portion meets the eligibility requirements contained in the first sentence of subsection (b)(1) of this section and the requirements of subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section (applied to the population of the portion of the urban county) and if it otherwise complies with the provisions of this section.

    (q) __Technical assistance grants__
