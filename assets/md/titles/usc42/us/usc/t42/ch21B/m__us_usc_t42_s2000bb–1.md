    (b) __Exception__ 

    Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—

        (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and

        (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

    (c) __Judicial relief__ 

        A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.
