 __Codification__ 

    In the first sentence of this section, provisions which specified an annual compensation of $5,000 for the chief of the Childrens Bureau have been omitted superseded. Following enactment of the Classification Act of 1923, the compensation was fixed in accordance with that Act. See act Feb. 27, 1925, title IV, [43 Stat. 1050][/us/stat/43/1050]. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] now contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 18a of Title 29][/us/usc/t29/s18a], Labor.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    Functions of Federal Security Administrator transferred to Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and all agencies of Federal Security Agency transferred to Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by section 5 of Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1953, set out as a note under [section 3501 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3501]. Federal Security Agency and office of Administrator abolished by section 8 of Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1953. Secretary and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare redesignated Secretary and Department of Health and Human Services by [section 509(b) of Pub. L. 96–88][/us/pl/96/88/s509/b] which is classified to [section 3508(b) of Title 20][/us/usc/t20/s3508/b], Education.

    “Federal Security Administrator” substituted for “said department” and for “Secretary of Labor” pursuant to Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1946. See note set out under [section 191 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s191].
