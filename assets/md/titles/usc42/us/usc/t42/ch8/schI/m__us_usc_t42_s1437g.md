            (C) __Treatment of savings__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The treatment of utility and waste management costs under the formula shall provide that a public housing agency shall receive the full financial benefit from any reduction in the cost of utilities or waste management resulting from any contract with a third party to undertake energy conservation improvements in one or more of its public housing projects.
