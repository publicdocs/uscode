## § 1437. Declaration of policy and public housing agency organization

    (a) __Declaration of policy__ 

    It is the policy of the United States—

        (1)

         to promote the general welfare of the Nation by employing the funds and credit of the Nation, as provided in this chapter—

            (A) to assist States and political subdivisions of States to remedy the unsafe housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent and safe dwellings for low-income families;

            (B) to assist States and political subdivisions of States to address the shortage of housing affordable to low-income families; and

            (C) consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, to vest in public housing agencies that perform well, the maximum amount of responsibility and flexibility in program administration, with appropriate accountability to public housing residents, localities, and the general public;

        (2) that the Federal Government cannot through its direct action alone provide for the housing of every American citizen, or even a majority of its citizens, but it is the responsibility of the Government to promote and protect the independent and collective actions of private citizens to develop housing and strengthen their own neighborhoods;

        (3) that the Federal Government should act where there is a serious need that private citizens or groups cannot or are not addressing responsibly; and

        (4) that our Nation should promote the goal of providing decent and affordable housing for all citizens through the efforts and encouragement of Federal, State, and local governments, and by the independent and collective actions of private citizens, organizations, and the private sector.

    (b) __Public housing agency organization__ 

        (1) __Required membership__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the membership of the board of directors or similar governing body of each public housing agency shall contain not less than 1 member—

            (A) who is directly assisted by the public housing agency; and

            (B) who may, if provided for in the public housing agency plan, be elected by the residents directly assisted by the public housing agency.

        (2) __Exception__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any public housing agency—

            (A) that is located in a State that requires the members of the board of directors or similar governing body of a public housing agency to be salaried and to serve on a full-time basis; or

            (B)

             with less than 300 public housing units, if—

                (i) the agency has provided reasonable notice to the resident advisory board of the opportunity of not less than 1 resident described in paragraph (1) to serve on the board of directors or similar governing body of the public housing agency pursuant to such paragraph; and

                (ii) within a reasonable time after receipt by the resident advisory board established by the agency pursuant to [section 1437c–1(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1437c–1/e] of notice under clause (i), the public housing agency has not been notified of the intention of any resident to participate on the board of directors.

        (3) __Nondiscrimination__ 

            No person shall be prohibited from serving on the board of directors or similar governing body of a public housing agency because of the residence of that person in a public housing project or status as assisted under [section 1437f of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1437f].

 __Congressional Statement of Findings and Purposes__ 

[Pub. L. 105–276, title V, § 502][/us/pl/105/276/s502], Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2520][/us/stat/112/2520], provided that:

>     “(a) __Findings.—__ 

>     Congress finds that—

>         “(1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, safe, and affordable housing;

>         “(2) the inventory of public housing units owned, assisted, or operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the Federal Government has invested over $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided rental housing that is affordable to low-income persons;

>         “(3) despite serving this critical function, the public housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including the concentration of very poor people in very poor neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-sufficiency;

>         “(4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations has aggravated the problem and has placed excessive administrative burdens on public housing agencies; and

>         “(5)

>          the interests of low-income persons, and the public interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing program that—

>             “(A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs for the operation and capital needs of public housing;

>             “(B) streamlines program requirements;

>             “(C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with appropriate accountability to public housing residents, localities, and the general public; and

>             “(D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of public housing residents.

>     “(b) __Purposes.—__ 

>     The purpose of this title \[see Tables for classification\] is to promote homes that are affordable to low-income families in safe and healthy environments, and thereby contribute to the supply of affordable housing, by—

>         “(1) deregulating and decontrolling public housing agencies, thereby enabling them to perform as property and asset managers;

>         “(2) providing for more flexible use of Federal assistance to public housing agencies, allowing the authorities to leverage and combine assistance amounts with amounts obtained from other sources;

>         “(3) facilitating mixed income communities and decreasing concentrations of poverty in public housing;

>         “(4) increasing accountability and rewarding effective management of public housing agencies;

>         “(5) creating incentives and economic opportunities for residents of dwelling units assisted by public housing agencies to work, become self-sufficient, and transition out of public housing and federally assisted dwelling units;

>         “(6) consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \[[42 U.S.C. 1437f][/us/usc/t42/s1437f]\] into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance under such section more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families; and

>         “(7) remedying the problems of troubled public housing agencies and replacing or revitalizing severely distressed public housing projects.”

 __Mental Health Action Plan__ 

[Pub. L. 105–276, title V, § 517][/us/pl/105/276/s517], Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2550][/us/stat/112/2550], provided that:
