## § 1437bbb. Purpose

    The purpose of this subchapter is to demonstrate the effectiveness of authorizing local governments and municipalities, in coordination with the public housing agencies for such jurisdictions—

    (1) to receive and combine program allocations of covered housing assistance; and

    (2)

     to design creative approaches for providing and administering Federal housing assistance based on the particular needs of the jurisdictions that—

        (A) provide incentives to low-income families with children whose head of the household is employed, seeking employment, or preparing for employment by participating in a job training or educational program, or any program that otherwise assists individuals in obtaining employment and attaining economic self-sufficiency;

        (B) reduce costs of Federal housing assistance and achieve greater cost-effectiveness in Federal housing assistance expenditures;

        (C) increase the stock of affordable housing and housing choices for low-income families;

        (D) increase homeownership among low-income families;

        (E) reduce geographic concentration of assisted families;

        (F) reduce homelessness through providing permanent housing solutions;

        (G) improve program management; and

        (H) achieve such other purposes with respect to low-income families, as determined by the participating local governments and municipalities in coordination with the public housing agencies;  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.
