## § 1437p. Demolition and disposition of public housing

    (a) __Applications for demolition and disposition__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon receiving an application by a public housing agency for authorization, with or without financial assistance under this subchapter, to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project (including any transfer to a resident-supported nonprofit entity), the Secretary shall approve the application, if the public housing agency certifies—

        (1)

         in the case of—

            (A)

             an application proposing demolition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project, that—

                (i) the project or portion of the public housing project is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unsuitable for housing purposes; and

                (ii) no reasonable program of modifications is cost-effective to return the public housing project or portion of the project to useful life; and

            (B) an application proposing the demolition of only a portion of a public housing project, that the demolition will help to ensure the viability of the remaining portion of the project;

        (2)

         in the case of an application proposing disposition by sale or other transfer of a public housing project or other real property subject to this subchapter—

            (A)

             the retention of the property is not in the best interests of the residents or the public housing agency because—

                (i) conditions in the area surrounding the public housing project adversely affect the health or safety of the residents or the feasible operation of the project by the public housing agency; or

                (ii) disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties that will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing;

            (B)

             the public housing agency has otherwise determined the disposition to be appropriate for reasons that are—

                (i) in the best interests of the residents and the public housing agency;

                (ii) consistent with the goals of the public housing agency and the public housing agency plan; and

                (iii) otherwise consistent with this subchapter; or

            (C) for property other than dwelling units, the property is excess to the needs of a public housing project or the disposition is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of a public housing project;

        (3) that the public housing agency has specifically authorized the demolition or disposition in the public housing agency plan, and has certified that the actions contemplated in the public housing agency plan comply with this section;

        (4)

         that the public housing agency—

            (A)

             will notify each family residing in a project subject to demolition or disposition 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health or safety, consistent with any guidelines issued by the Secretary governing such notifications, that—

                (i) the public housing project will be demolished or disposed of;

                (ii) the demolition of the building in which the family resides will not commence until each resident of the building is relocated; and

                (iii)

                 each family displaced by such action will be offered comparable housing—

                    (I) that meets housing quality standards;

                    (II) that is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced person’s housing; and

                    (III)

                     which may include—

                        (aa) tenant-based assistance, except that the requirement under this clause regarding offering of comparable housing shall be fulfilled by use of tenant-based assistance only upon the relocation of such family into such housing;

                        (bb) project-based assistance; or

                        (cc) occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the public housing agency at a rental rate paid by the family that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the family is vacated;

            (B) will provide for the payment of the actual and reasonable relocation expenses of each resident to be displaced;

            (C) will ensure that each displaced resident is offered comparable housing in accordance with the notice under subparagraph (A); and  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The word “and” probably should not appear. </sup></sup> 

            (D) will provide any necessary counseling for residents who are displaced; and

            (E) will not commence demolition or complete disposition until all residents residing in the building are relocated;

        (5)

         that the net proceeds of any disposition will be used—

            (A) unless waived by the Secretary, for the retirement of outstanding obligations issued to finance the original public housing project or modernization of the project; and

            (B)

             to the extent that any proceeds remain after the application of proceeds in accordance with subparagraph (A), for—

                (i) the provision of low-income housing or to benefit the residents of the public housing agency; or

                (ii) leveraging amounts for securing commercial enterprises, on-site in public housing projects of the public housing agency, appropriate to serve the needs of the residents; and

        (6) that the public housing agency has complied with subsection (c) of this section.

    (b) __Disapproval of applications__ 

    The Secretary shall disapprove an application submitted under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary determines that—

        (1) any certification made by the public housing agency under that subsection is clearly inconsistent with information and data available to the Secretary or information or data requested by the Secretary; or

        (2)

         the application was not developed in consultation with—

            (A) residents who will be affected by the proposed demolition or disposition;

            (B) each resident advisory board and resident council, if any, of the project (or portion thereof) that will be affected by the proposed demolition or disposition; and

            (C) appropriate government officials.

    (c) __Resident opportunity to purchase in case of proposed disposition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of a proposed disposition of a public housing project or portion of a project, the public housing agency shall, in appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Secretary, initially offer the property to any eligible resident organization, eligible resident management corporation, or nonprofit organization acting on behalf of the residents, if that entity has expressed an interest, in writing, to the public housing agency in a timely manner, in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing.

        (2) __Timing__ 

            (A) __Expression of interest__ 

                A resident organization, resident management corporation, or other resident-supported nonprofit entity referred to in paragraph (1) may express interest in purchasing property that is the subject of a disposition, as described in paragraph (1), during the 30-day period beginning on the date of notification of a proposed sale of the property.

            (B) __Opportunity to arrange purchase__ 

                If an entity expresses written interest in purchasing a property, as provided in subparagraph (A), no disposition of the property shall occur during the 60-day period beginning on the date of receipt of that written notice (other than to the entity providing the notice), during which time that entity shall be given the opportunity to obtain a firm commitment for financing the purchase of the property.

    (d) __Replacement units__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, replacement public housing units for public housing units demolished in accordance with this section may be built on the original public housing location or in the same neighborhood as the original public housing location if the number of the replacement public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of units demolished.

    (e) __Consolidation of occupancy within or among buildings__ 

        Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent a public housing agency from consolidating occupancy within or among buildings of a public housing project, or among projects, or with other housing for the purpose of improving living conditions of, or providing more efficient services to, residents.

    (f) __De minimis exception to demolition requirements__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any 5-year period a public housing agency may demolish not more than the lesser of 5 dwelling units or 5 percent of the total dwelling units owned by the public housing agency, but only if the space occupied by the demolished unit is used for meeting the service or other needs of public housing residents or the demolished unit was beyond repair.

    (g) __Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Act__ 

        The Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 \[[42 U.S.C. 4601][/us/usc/t42/s4601] et seq.\] shall not apply to activities under this section.

    (h) __Relocation and replacement__ 

        Of the amounts appropriated for tenant-based assistance under [section 1437f of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1437f] in any fiscal year, the Secretary may use such sums as are necessary for relocation and replacement housing for dwelling units that are demolished and disposed of from the public housing inventory (in addition to other amounts that may be available for such purposes).
