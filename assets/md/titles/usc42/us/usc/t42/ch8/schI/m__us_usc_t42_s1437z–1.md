    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Effect on other remedies__

        (2) __Failure of Secretary__ 

            The Secretary may not impose penalties under this section for a violation, if a material cause of the violation is the failure of the Secretary, an agent of the Secretary, or a public housing agency to comply with an existing agreement.

    (b) __Violations of housing assistance payment contracts for which penalty may be imposed__ 

        (1) __Liable parties__ 

        The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty under this section on—

            (C) any agent employed to manage the property that has an identity of interest with the owner or the general partner of a partnership owner of the property.

        (2) __Violations__ 

        A penalty may be imposed under this section for a knowing and material breach of a housing assistance payments contract, including the following—

            (A) failure to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing pursuant to section 8 \[[42 U.S.C. 1437f][/us/usc/t42/s1437f]\]; or

        (3) __Amount of penalty__ 

            The amount of a penalty imposed for a violation under this subsection, as determined by the Secretary, may not exceed $25,000 per violation.

    (c) __Agency procedures__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall issue regulations establishing standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (b) of this section. These standards and procedures—

        (2) __Final orders__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If a hearing is not requested before the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on the date on which the notice of opportunity for hearing is received, the imposition of a penalty under subsection (b) of this section shall constitute a final and unappealable determination.

            (B) __Effect of review__ 

                If the Secretary reviews the determination or order, the Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order.

            (C) __Failure to review__

        (3) __Factors in determining amount of penalty__ 

        In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration—

            (A) the gravity of the offense;

            (B) any history of prior offenses by the violator (including offenses occurring before the enactment of this section);

            (C) the ability of the violator to pay the penalty;

            (D) any injury to tenants;

            (E) any injury to the public;

            (F) any benefits received by the violator as a result of the violation;

            (G) deterrence of future violations; and

            (H) such other factors as the Secretary may establish by regulation.

        (4) __Payment of penalty__ 

            No payment of a civil money penalty levied under this section shall be payable out of project income.

            In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the determination or order of the Secretary imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.

    (f) __Settlement by Secretary__ 

        The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.

    (g) __Deposit of penalties__ 

        (1) __In general__
