## § 4011. Authorization to establish and carry out program

    (a) __Authorization and establishment__ 

        To carry out the purposes of this chapter, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is authorized to establish and carry out a national flood insurance program which will enable interested persons to purchase insurance against loss resulting from physical damage to or loss of real property or personal property related thereto arising from any flood occurring in the United States.

    (b) __Additional coverage for compliance with land use and control measures__ 

    The national flood insurance program established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of implementing measures that are consistent with land use and control measures established by the community under [section 4102 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4102] for—

        (1) properties that are repetitive loss structures;

        (2) properties that are substantially damaged structures;

        (3) properties that have sustained flood damage on multiple occasions, if the Administrator determines that it is cost-effective and in the best interests of the National Flood Insurance Fund to require the implementation of such measures; and

        (4)

         properties for which an offer of mitigation assistance is made under—

            (A) [section 4104c of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4104c] (Flood Mitigation Assistance Program);

            (B) the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program authorized under [section 5170c of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5170c];

            (C) the Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Program under [section 5133 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5133]; and

            (D) any programs authorized or for which funds are appropriated to address any unmet needs or for which supplemental funds are made available.

        The Administrator shall impose a surcharge on each insured of not more than $75 per policy to provide cost of compliance coverage in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

    (c) __Participation and risk sharing by insurers__ 

    In carrying out the flood insurance program the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, encourage and arrange for—

        (1) appropriate financial participation and risk sharing in the program by insurance companies and other insurers, and

        (2) other appropriate participation, on other than a risk-sharing basis, by insurance companies and other insurers, insurance agents and brokers, and insurance adjustment organizations,

        in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of this chapter.

>     “(a) __Report.—__

>         “(1) __Eligible coverage.—__ 

>         For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘eligible coverage’ means coverage under a new contract for flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program, or a modification to coverage under an existing flood insurance contract, for property damaged by the flooding of the Missouri River that commenced on June 1, 2011, that was purchased or made during the period beginning May 1, 2011, and ending June 6, 2011.

 __Congressional Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 108–264, § 2][/us/pl/108/264/s2], June 30, 2004, [118 Stat. 712][/us/stat/118/712], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1)

>      the national flood insurance program—

>         “(A) identifies the flood risk;

>         “(B) provides flood risk information to the public;

>         “(C) encourages State and local governments to make appropriate land use adjustments to constrict the development of land which is exposed to flood damage and minimize damage caused by flood losses; and

>         “(D) makes flood insurance available on a nationwide basis that would otherwise not be available, to accelerate recovery from floods, mitigate future losses, save lives, and reduce the personal and national costs of flood disasters;

>     “(2) the national flood insurance program insures approximately 4,400,000 policyholders;

>     “(3) approximately 48,000 properties currently insured under the program have experienced, within a 10-year period, 2 or more flood losses where each such loss exceeds the amount $1,000;

>     “(4) approximately 10,000 of these repetitive-loss properties have experienced either 2 or 3 losses that cumulatively exceed building value or 4 or more losses, each exceeding $1,000;

>     “(5) repetitive-loss properties constitute a significant drain on the resources of the national flood insurance program, costing about $200,000,000 annually;

>     “(6) repetitive-loss properties comprise approximately 1 percent of currently insured properties but are expected to account for 25 to 30 percent of claims losses;

>     “(7) the vast majority of repetitive-loss properties were built before local community implementation of floodplain management standards under the program and thus are eligible for subsidized flood insurance;

>     “(8) while some property owners take advantage of the program allowing subsidized flood insurance without requiring mitigation action, others are trapped in a vicious cycle of suffering flooding, then repairing flood damage, then suffering flooding, without the means to mitigate losses or move out of harm’s way;

>     “(9) mitigation of repetitive-loss properties through buyouts, elevations, relocations, or flood-proofing will produce savings for policyholders under the program and for Federal taxpayers through reduced flood insurance losses and reduced Federal disaster assistance;

>     “(10) a strategy of making mitigation offers aimed at high-priority repetitive-loss properties and shifting more of the burden of recovery costs to property owners who choose to remain vulnerable to repetitive flood damage can encourage property owners to take appropriate actions that reduce loss of life and property damage and benefit the financial soundness of the program;

>     “(11) the method for addressing repetitive-loss properties should be flexible enough to take into consideration legitimate circumstances that may prevent an owner from taking a mitigation action; and

>     “(12) focusing the mitigation and buy-out of repetitive loss properties upon communities and property owners that choose to voluntarily participate in a mitigation and buy-out program will maximize the benefits of such a program, while minimizing any adverse impact on communities and property owners.”
