        Owners of existing National Flood Insurance Act policies with respect to structures located within the Floodway established under [section 1600c of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1600c] shall have the right to renew and transfer such policies. Owners of existing structures located within said Floodway on October 8, 1986, who have not acquired National Flood Insurance Act policies shall have the right to acquire policies with respect to such structures for six months after the Secretary of the Interior files the Floodway maps required by section 1600c(b)(2)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 43 and to renew and transfer such policies.

    (b) __New coverage for new construction or substantial improvements__ 

        No new flood insurance coverage may be provided under this chapter on or after a date six months after October 8, 1986, for any new construction or substantial improvements of structures located within the Colorado River Floodway established by [section 1600c of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1600c]. New construction includes all structures that are not insurable prior to that date.

    (c) __Establishment of temporary boundaries__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior may by rule after notice and comment pursuant to [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] establish temporary Floodway boundaries to be in effect until the maps required by section 1600c(b)(2) 1 of title 43 are filed, for the purpose of enforcing subsections (b) and (d) of this section.

    (d) __Loans by federally supervised, approved, regulated, or insured financial institutions__ 

        A regulated lending institution or Federal agency lender may make loans secured by structures which are not eligible for flood insurance by reason of this section: Provided, That prior to making such a loan, such institution determines that the loans or structures securing the loan are within the Floodway.

([Pub. L. 90–448, title XIII, § 1322][/us/pl/90/448/s1322], as added [Pub. L. 99–450, § 12][/us/pl/99/450/s12], Oct. 8, 1986, [100 Stat. 1135][/us/stat/100/1135]; amended [Pub. L. 100–242, title V, § 545(e)][/us/pl/100/242/s545/e], Feb. 5, 1988, [101 Stat. 1942][/us/stat/101/1942]; [Pub. L. 103–325, title V, § 512(b)][/us/pl/103/325/s512/b], Sept. 23, 1994, [108 Stat. 2257][/us/stat/108/2257].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The National Flood Insurance Act, referred to in subsec. (a), probably means the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, title XIII of [Pub. L. 90–448][/us/pl/90/448], Aug. 1, 1968, [82 Stat. 572][/us/stat/82/572], as amended, which is classified principally to this chapter (§ 4001 et seq.). For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 4001 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4001] and Tables.

    [Section 1600c(b)(2) of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1600c/b/2], referred to in subsecs. (a) and (c), was struck out and former subsec. (b)(1)(ii) redesignated (b)(2) of section 1600c by [Pub. L. 105–362, title IX, § 901(d)(1)][/us/pl/105/362/s901/d/1], Nov. 10, 1998, [112 Stat. 3289][/us/stat/112/3289]. As amended, section 1600c(b)(2) no longer relates to maps required to be prepared and filed by the Secretary.

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original a reference to “this title” meaning title XIII of [Pub. L. 90–448][/us/pl/90/448], Aug. 1, 1968, [82 Stat. 572][/us/stat/82/572], known as the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 4001 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4001] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 103–325][/us/pl/103/325] substituted “regulated lending institution or Federal agency lender” for “federally supervised, approved, regulated or insured financial institution”.

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–242][/us/pl/100/242] inserted section catchline.
