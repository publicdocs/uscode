## § 4014. Estimates of premium rates

    (a) __Studies and investigations__ 

    The Administrator is authorized to undertake and carry out such studies and investigations and receive or exchange such information as may be necessary to estimate, and shall from time to time estimate, on an area, subdivision, or other appropriate basis—

        (1)

         the risk premium rates for flood insurance which—

            (A) based on consideration of the risk involved and accepted actuarial principles, and

            (B)

             including—

                (i) the applicable operating costs and allowances set forth in the schedules prescribed under [section 4018 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4018] and reflected in such rates,

                (ii) any administrative expenses (or portion of such expenses) of carrying out the flood insurance program which, in his discretion, should properly be reflected in such rates,

                (iii) any remaining administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under [section 4101 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4101]) not included under clause (ii), which shall be recovered by a fee charged to policyholders and such fee shall not be subject to any agents’ commissions, company expense allowances, or State or local premium taxes, and

                (iv)

                 all costs, as prescribed by principles and standards of practice in ratemaking adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society, including—

                    (I) an estimate of the expected value of future costs,

                    (II) all costs associated with the transfer of risk, and

                    (III) the costs associated with an individual risk transfer with respect to risk classes, as defined by the Administrator,

            would be required in order to make such insurance available on an actuarial basis for any types and classes of properties for which insurance coverage is available under [section 4012(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4012/a] (or is recommended to the Congress under [section 4012(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4012/b]);

        (2)

         the rates, if less than the rates estimated under paragraph (1), which would be reasonable, would encourage prospective insureds to purchase flood insurance, and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and which, together with a fee charged to policyholders that shall not be not subject to any agents’ commission, company expenses allowances, or State or local premium taxes, shall include any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under [section 4101 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4101]), except that the Administrator shall not estimate rates under this paragraph for—

            (A) any residential property which is not the primary residence of an individual;

            (B) any severe repetitive loss property;

            (C) any property that has incurred flood-related damage in which the cumulative amounts of payments under this chapter equaled or exceeded the fair market value of such property;

            (D) any business property; or

            (E)

             any property which on or after July 6, 2012, has experienced or sustained—

                (i) substantial damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of such property; or

                (ii) substantial improvement exceeding 30 percent of the fair market value of such property; and

        (3) the extent, if any, to which federally assisted or other flood protection measures initiated after August 1, 1968, affect such rates.

    (b) __Utilization of services of other Departments and agencies__ 

        In carrying out subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent feasible and on a reimbursement basis, utilize the services of the Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and, as appropriate, other Federal departments or agencies, and for such purposes may enter into agreements or other appropriate arrangements with any persons.

    (c) __Priority to studies and investigations in States or areas evidencing positive interest in securing insurance under program__ 

        The Administrator shall give priority to conducting studies and investigations and making estimates under this section in those States or areas (or subdivisions thereof) which he has determined have evidenced a positive interest in securing flood insurance coverage under the flood insurance program.

    (d) __Parishes of Louisiana; premium rates__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any structure existing on December 31, 1973, and located within Avoyelles, Evangeline, Rapides, or Saint Landry Parish in the State of Louisiana, which the Secretary determines is subject to additional flood hazards as a result of the construction or operation of the Atchafalaya Basin Levee System, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates that shall not exceed those which would be applicable if such additional hazards did not exist.

    (e) __Eligibility of community making adequate progress on construction of flood protection system for rates not exceeding those applicable to completed flood protection system; determination of adequate progress__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any community that has made adequate progress, acceptable to the Administrator, on the construction of a flood protection system which will afford flood protection for the one-hundred year frequency flood as determined by the Administrator, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates not exceeding those which would be applicable under this section if such flood protection system had been completed. The Administrator shall find that adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system as required herein has been only if (1) 100 percent of the project cost of the system has been authorized, (2) at least 60 percent of the project cost of the system has been appropriated, (3) at least 50 percent of the project cost of the system has been expended, and (4) the system is at least 50 percent completed.

    (f) __Availability of flood insurance in communities restoring disaccredited flood protection systems; criteria; rates__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this subsection shall only apply in a community which has been determined by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a flood protection system that had been previously accredited on a Flood Insurance Rate Map as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so. Except as provided in this subsection, in such a community, flood insurance shall be made available to those properties impacted by the disaccreditation of the flood protection system at premium rates that do not exceed those which would be applicable to any property located in an area of special flood hazard, the construction of which was started prior to the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Administrator for the community in which such property is located. A revised Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be prepared for the community to delineate as Zone AR the areas of special flood hazard that result from the disaccreditation of the flood protection system. A community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if—

        (1) the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor;

        (2) a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the disaccredited system; and

        (3) restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to occur within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

        Communities that the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency determines to meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) as of January 1, 1992, shall not be subject to revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps that contravene the intent of this subsection. Such communities shall remain eligible for C zone rates for properties located in zone AR for any policy written prior to promulgation of final regulations for this section. Floodplain management criteria for such communities shall not require the elevation of improvements to existing structures and shall not exceed 3 feet above existing grade for new construction, provided the base flood elevation based on the disaccredited flood control system does not exceed five feet above existing grade, or the remaining new construction in such communities is limited to infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas.

        The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall develop and promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months after October 28, 1992.

    (g) __No extension of subsidy to new policies or lapsed policies__ 

    The Administrator shall not provide flood insurance to prospective insureds at rates less than those estimated under subsection (a)(1), as required by paragraph (2) of that subsection, for—

        (1) any property not insured by the flood insurance program as of July 6, 2012;

        (2) any property purchased after July 6, 2012;

        (3) any policy under the flood insurance program that has lapsed in coverage, as a result of the deliberate choice of the holder of such policy; or

        (4)

         any prospective insured who refuses to accept any offer for mitigation assistance by the Administrator (including an offer to relocate), including an offer of mitigation assistance—

            (A) following a major disaster, as defined in [section 5122 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5122]; or

            (B)

             in connection with—

                (i) a repetitive loss property; or

                (ii) a severe repetitive loss property.

    (h) __Definition__ 

    In this section, the term “severe repetitive loss property” has the following meaning:

        (1) __Single-family properties__ 

        In the case of a property consisting of 1 to 4 residences, such term means a property that—

            (A) is covered under a contract for flood insurance made available under this chapter; and

            (B)

             has incurred flood-related damage—

                (i) for which 4 or more separate claims payments have been made under flood insurance coverage under this subchapter, with the amount of each such claim exceeding $5,000, and with the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeding $20,000; or

                (ii) for which at least 2 separate claims payments have been made under such coverage, with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the value of the property.

        (2) __Multifamily properties__ 

            In the case of a property consisting of 5 or more residences, such term shall have such meaning as the Director  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably means “Administrator”. </sup></sup>  shall by regulation provide.
