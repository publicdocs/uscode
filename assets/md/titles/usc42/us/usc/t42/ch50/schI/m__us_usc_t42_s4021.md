    (b) __Extent of participation__ 

    In satisfying the requirements of subsection (a), the Administrator shall require that each representative of the Administrator—

        (1) be certified for purposes of the national flood insurance program to settle claims against such program resulting from such disaster in amounts up to the limits of policies under such program;

        (2) attend State-sponsored mediation meetings regarding flood insurance claims resulting from such disaster at such times and places as may be arranged by the State;

        (3) participate in good-faith negotiations toward the settlement of such claims with policyholders of coverage made available under the national flood insurance program; and

        (4) finalize the settlement of such claims on behalf of the national flood insurance program with such policyholders.

    (c) __Coordination__ 

        Representatives of the Administrator shall at all times coordinate their activities with insurance officials of the State and representatives of insurers for the purposes of consolidating and expediting settlement of claims under the national flood insurance program resulting from such disaster.

    Each State mediator participating in State-sponsored mediation under this section shall be—

        (2) a retired trial judge from any United States jurisdiction who was a member in good standing of the bar in the State in which the judge presided for at least 5 years prior to the year in which such mediator’s participation is sought.

    (e) __Mediation proceedings and documents privileged__ 

        As a condition of participation, all statements made and documents produced pursuant to State-sponsored mediation involving representatives of the Administrator shall be deemed privileged and confidential settlement negotiations made in anticipation of litigation.

    Participation in State-sponsored mediation, as described in this section does not—
