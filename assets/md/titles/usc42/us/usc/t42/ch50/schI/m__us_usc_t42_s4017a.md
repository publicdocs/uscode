## § 4017a. Reserve Fund

    (a) __Establishment of Reserve Fund__ 

    In carrying out the flood insurance program authorized by this subchapter, the Administrator shall establish in the Treasury of the United States a National Flood Insurance Reserve Fund (in this section referred to as the “Reserve Fund”) which shall—

        (1) be an account separate from any other accounts or funds available to the Administrator; and

        (2)

         be available for meeting the expected future obligations of the flood insurance program, including—

            (A) the payment of claims;

            (B) claims adjustment expenses; and

            (C) the repayment of amounts outstanding under any note or other obligation issued by the Administrator under [section 4016(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4016/a].

    (b) __Reserve ratio__ 

    Subject to the phase-in requirements under subsection (d), the Reserve Fund shall maintain a balance equal to—

        (1) 1 percent of the sum of the total potential loss exposure of all outstanding flood insurance policies in force in the prior fiscal year; or

        (2) such higher percentage as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, taking into consideration any circumstance that may raise a significant risk of substantial future losses to the Reserve Fund.

    (c) __Maintenance of reserve ratio__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Administrator shall have the authority to establish, increase, or decrease the amount of aggregate annual insurance premiums to be collected for any fiscal year necessary—

            (A) to maintain the reserve ratio required under subsection (b); and

            (B) to achieve such reserve ratio, if the actual balance of such reserve is below the amount required under subsection (b).

        (2) __Considerations__ 

        In exercising the authority granted under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider—

            (A) the expected operating expenses of the Reserve Fund;

            (B) the insurance loss expenditures under the flood insurance program;

            (C) any investment income generated under the flood insurance program; and

            (D) any other factor that the Administrator determines appropriate.

        (3) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Rates__ 

                In exercising the authority granted under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall be subject to all other provisions of this chapter, including any provisions relating to chargeable premium rates or annual increases of such rates.

            (B) __Use of additional annual insurance premiums__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any agreement entered into by the Administrator, the Administrator shall ensure that all amounts attributable to the establishment or increase of annual insurance premiums under paragraph (1) are transferred to the Administrator for deposit into the Reserve Fund, to be available for meeting the expected future obligations of the flood insurance program as described in subsection (a)(2).

        (4) __Deposit of premium surcharges__ 

            The Administrator shall deposit in the Reserve Fund any surcharges collected pursuant to [section 4015a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s4015a].

    (d) __Phase-in requirements__ 

    The phase-in requirements under this subsection are as follows:

        (1) __In general__ 

            Beginning in fiscal year 2013 and not ending until the fiscal year in which the ratio required under subsection (b) is achieved, in each such fiscal year the Administrator shall place in the Reserve Fund an amount equal to not less than 7.5 percent of the reserve ratio required under subsection (b).

        (2) __Amount satisfied__ 

            As soon as the ratio required under subsection (b) is achieved, and except as provided in paragraph (3), the Administrator shall not be required to set aside any amounts for the Reserve Fund.

        (3) __Exception__ 

            If at any time after the ratio required under subsection (b) is achieved, the Reserve Fund falls below the required ratio under subsection (b), the Administrator shall place in the Reserve Fund for that fiscal year an amount equal to not less than 7.5 percent of the reserve ratio required under subsection (b).

    (e) __Limitation on reserve ratio__ 

    In any given fiscal year, if the Administrator determines that the reserve ratio required under subsection (b) cannot be achieved, the Administrator shall submit, on a calendar quarterly basis, a report to Congress that—

        (1) describes and details the specific concerns of the Administrator regarding the consequences of the reserve ratio not being achieved;

        (2) demonstrates how such consequences would harm the long-term financial soundness of the flood insurance program; and

        (3) indicates the maximum attainable reserve ratio for that particular fiscal year.

    (f) __Investment__ 

        The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest such amounts of the Reserve Fund as the Secretary determines advisable in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States.
