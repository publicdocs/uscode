## § 1962d–5b. Written agreement requirement for water resources projects

    (a) __Cooperation of non-Federal interest__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            After December 31, 1970, the construction of any water resources project, or an acceptable separable element thereof, by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal interest where such interest will be reimbursed for such construction under any provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal interest has entered into a written partnership agreement with the Secretary (or, where appropriate, the district engineer for the district in which the project will be carried out) under which each party agrees to carry out its responsibilities and requirements for implementation or construction of the project or the appropriate element of the project, as the case may be; except that no such agreement shall be required if the Secretary determines that the administrative costs associated with negotiating, executing, or administering the agreement would exceed the amount of the contribution required from the non-Federal interest and are less than $25,000.

        (2) __Liquidated damages__ 

            A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may include a provision for liquidated damages in the event of a failure of one or more parties to perform.

        (3) __Obligation of future appropriations__ 

            In any partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) and entered into by a State, or a body politic of the State which derives its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that it does not obligate future appropriations for such performance and payment when obligating future appropriations would be inconsistent with constitutional or statutory limitations of the State or a political subdivision of the State.

        (4) __Credit for in-kind contributions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may provide with respect to a project that the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the project, including a project implemented without specific authorization in law, the value of in-kind contributions made by the non-Federal interest, including—

                (i) the costs of planning (including data collection), design, management, mitigation, construction, and construction services that are provided by the non-Federal interest for implementation of the project;

                (ii) the value of materials or services provided before execution of the partnership agreement, including efforts on constructed elements incorporated into the project; and

                (iii) the value of materials and services provided after execution of the partnership agreement.

            (B) __Condition__ 

                The Secretary may credit an in-kind contribution under subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that the material or service provided as an in-kind contribution is integral to the project.

            (C) __Work performed before partnership agreement__ 

                In any case in which the non-Federal interest is to receive credit under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the cost of work carried out by the non-Federal interest and such work has not been carried out as of November 8, 2007, the Secretary and the non-Federal interest shall enter into an agreement under which the non-Federal interest shall carry out such work, and only work carried out following the execution of the agreement shall be eligible for credit.

            (D) __Limitations__ 

            Credit authorized under this paragraph for a project—

                (i) shall not exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the project;

                (ii) shall not alter any other requirement that a non-Federal interest provide lands, easements, relocations, rights-of-way, or areas for disposal of dredged material for the project;

                (iii) shall not alter any requirement that a non-Federal interest pay a portion of the costs of construction of the project under sections 2211 and 2213 of title 33; and

                (iv) shall not exceed the actual and reasonable costs of the materials, services, or other things provided by the non-Federal interest, as determined by the Secretary.

            (E) __Applicability__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    This paragraph shall apply to water resources projects authorized after November 16, 1986, including projects initiated after November 16, 1986, without specific authorization in law.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    In any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a non-Federal interest to receive credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a study for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources project, the specific provision of law shall apply instead of this paragraph.

    (b) __Definition of non-Federal interest__ 

    The term “non-Federal interest” means—

        (1) a legally constituted public body (including a federally recognized Indian tribe); or

        (2) a nonprofit entity with the consent of the affected local government,

        that has full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement and to pay damages, if necessary, in the event of failure to perform.

    (c) __Enforcement; jurisdiction__ 

        Every agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be enforcible in the appropriate district court of the United States.

    (d) __Nonperformance of terms of agreement by non-Federal interest; notice; reasonable opportunity for performance; performance by Chief of Engineers__ 

        After commencement of construction of a project, the Chief of Engineers may undertake performance of those items of cooperation necessary to the functioning of the project for its purposes, if he has first notified the non-Federal interest of its failure to perform the terms of its agreement and has given such interest a reasonable time after such notification to so perform.

    (e) __Delegation of authority__ 

    Not later than June 30, 2008, the Secretary shall issue policies and guidelines for partnership agreements that delegate to the district engineers, at a minimum—

        (1) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement that has appeared in an agreement previously approved by the Secretary;

        (2) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement the specific terms of which are dictated by law or by a final feasibility study, final environmental impact statement, or other final decision document for a water resources project;

        (3) the authority to approve any partnership agreement that complies with the policies and guidelines issued by the Secretary; and

        (4) the authority to sign any partnership agreement for any water resources project unless, within 30 days of the date of authorization of the project, the Secretary notifies the district engineer in which the project will be carried out that the Secretary wishes to retain the prerogative to sign the partnership agreement for that project.

    (f) __Report to Congress__ 

    Not later than 2 years after November 8, 2007, and every year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report detailing the following:

        (1) The number of partnership agreements signed by district engineers and the number of partnership agreements signed by the Secretary.

        (2) For any partnership agreement signed by the Secretary, an explanation of why delegation to the district engineer was not appropriate.

    (g) __Public availability__ 

    Not later than 120 days after November 8, 2007, the Chief of Engineers shall—

        (1) ensure that each district engineer has made available to the public, including on the Internet, all partnership agreements entered into under this section within the preceding 10 years and all partnership agreements for water resources projects currently being carried out in that district; and

        (2) make each partnership agreement entered into after November 8, 2007, available to the public, including on the Internet, not later than 7 days after the date on which such agreement is entered into.

    (h) __Effective date__ 

        This section shall not apply to any project the construction of which was commenced before January 1, 1972, or to the assurances for future demands required by the Water Supply Act of 1958, as amended \[[43 U.S.C. 390b][/us/usc/t43/s390b]\].
