## § 1962d–5. Water resources development projects involving navigation, flood control, and shore protection

    (a) __Construction, operation, and maintenance; limitation on estimated Federal first cost of construction; Congressional committee approval of projects; reports to Congress__ 

        The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized to construct, operate, and maintain any water resource development project, including single and multiple purpose projects involving, but not limited to, navigation, flood control, and shore protection, if the estimated Federal first cost of constructing such project is less than $15,000,000. No appropriation shall be made to construct, operate, or maintain any such project if such project has not been approved by resolutions adopted by the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives, respectively. For the purpose of securing consideration of such approval the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report of such proposed project, including all relevant data and all costs.

    (b) __Local cooperation requirements based on certain estimated Federal first cost of construction__ 

        Any water resource development project authorized to be constructed by this section shall be subject to the same requirements of local cooperation as it would be if the estimated Federal first cost of such project were $15,000,000 or more.
