        This section may be cited as the “Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act of 2007”.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Data mining__ 

        The term “data mining” means a program involving pattern-based queries, searches, or other analyses of 1 or more electronic databases, where—

            (B) the queries, searches, or other analyses are not subject-based and do not use personal identifiers of a specific individual, or inputs associated with a specific individual or group of individuals, to retrieve information from the database or databases; and

            (C)

             the purpose of the queries, searches, or other analyses is not solely—

                (i) the detection of fraud, waste, or abuse in a Government agency or program; or

                (ii) the security of a Government computer system.

        (2) __Database__ 

            The term “database” does not include telephone directories, news reporting, information publicly available to any member of the public without payment of a fee, or databases of judicial and administrative opinions or other legal research sources.

            (C) A thorough description of the data sources that are being or will be used.

            (D) An assessment of the efficacy or likely efficacy of the data mining activity in providing accurate information consistent with and valuable to the stated goals and plans for the use or development of the data mining activity.

            (E) An assessment of the impact or likely impact of the implementation of the data mining activity on the privacy and civil liberties of individuals, including a thorough description of the actions that are being taken or will be taken with regard to the property, privacy, or other rights or privileges of any individual or individuals as a result of the implementation of the data mining activity.

            (F) A list and analysis of the laws and regulations that govern the information being or to be collected, reviewed, gathered, analyzed, or used in conjunction with the data mining activity, to the extent applicable in the context of the data mining activity.

            (G)

             A thorough discussion of the policies, procedures, and guidelines that are in place or that are to be developed and applied in the use of such data mining activity in order to—

                (i) protect the privacy and due process rights of individuals, such as redress procedures; and

                (ii) ensure that only accurate and complete information is collected, reviewed, gathered, analyzed, or used, and guard against any harmful consequences of potential inaccuracies.
