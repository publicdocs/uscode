## § 18323. Multi-purpose crew vehicle

    (a) __Initiation of development__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Administrator shall continue the development of a multi-purpose crew vehicle to be available as soon as practicable, and no later than for use with the Space Launch System. The vehicle shall continue to advance development of the human safety features, designs, and systems in the Orion project.

        (2) __Goal for operational capability__ 

            It shall be the goal to achieve full operational capability for the transportation vehicle developed pursuant to this subsection by not later than December 31, 2016. For purposes of meeting such goal, the Administrator may undertake a test of the transportation vehicle at the ISS before that date.

    (b) __Minimum capability requirements__ 

    The multi-purpose crew vehicle developed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be designed to have, at a minimum, the following:

        (1) The capability to serve as the primary crew vehicle for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.
