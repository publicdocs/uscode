         existing contracts, investments, workforce, industrial base, and capabilities from the Space Shuttle and Orion and Ares 1 projects, including—

            (A) space-suit development activities for application to, and coordinated development of, a multi-purpose crew vehicle suit and associated life-support requirements with potential development of standard NASA-certified suit and life support systems for use in alternative commercially-developed crew transportation systems; and

            (B) Space Shuttle-derived components and Ares 1 components that use existing United States propulsion systems, including liquid fuel engines, external tank or tank-related capability, and solid rocket motor engines; and

        (2) associated testing facilities, either in being or under construction as of October 11, 2010.

    (b) __Discharge of requirements__ 

    In meeting the requirements of subsection (a), the Administrator—

        (1) shall, to the extent practicable, utilize ground-based manufacturing capability, ground testing activities, launch and operations infrastructure, and workforce expertise;

        (2) shall, to the extent practicable, minimize the modification and development of ground infrastructure and maximize the utilization of existing software, vehicle, and mission operations processes;

        (3) shall complete construction and activation of the A–3 test stand with a completion goal of September 30, 2013;

        (4) may procure, develop, and flight test applicable components; and
