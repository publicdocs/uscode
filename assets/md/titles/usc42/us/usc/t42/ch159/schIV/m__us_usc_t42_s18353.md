            In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall, as soon as is practicable after October 11, 2010, carry out a comprehensive assessment of the essential modules, operational systems and components, structural elements, and permanent scientific equipment on board or planned for delivery and installation aboard the ISS, including both United States and international partner elements, for purposes of identifying the spare or replacement modules, systems and components, elements, and equipment that are required to ensure complete, effective, and safe functioning and full scientific utilization of the ISS through September 30, 2020.

        (2) __Data__ 

            In carrying out the assessment, the Administrator shall assemble any existing data, and provide for the development of any data or analysis not currently available, that is necessary for purposes of the assessment.

                    (I) its specifications, including size, weight, and necessary configuration for launch and delivery to the ISS;

                    (II) its function;

                    (III) its location; and

                    (IV) its criticality for ISS system integrity.

                (ii)

                 A description of the spare or replacement modules, systems and components, elements, and equipment identified pursuant to the assessment that are not currently produced, in inventory, or on order, including for each such module, system or component, element, or equipment a description of—

                    (I) its specifications, including size, weight, and necessary configuration for launch and delivery to the ISS;

                    (II) its function;

                    (III) its location;

                    (IV) its criticality for ISS system integrity; and

                    (V) the anticipated cost and schedule for its design, procurement, manufacture, and delivery to the ISS.

                (iii) A detailed summary of the delivery schedule and associated delivery vehicle requirements necessary to transport all spare and replacement elements considered essential for the ongoing and sustained functionality of all critical systems of the ISS, both in and of themselves and as an element of an integrated, mutually dependent essential capability, including an assessment of the current schedule for delivery, the availability of delivery vehicles to meet that schedule, and the likelihood of meeting that schedule through such vehicles.
