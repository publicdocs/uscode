    (a) __In general__ 

        The Administrator shall plan, develop, and implement a program, in coordination with other Federal agencies, to detect, track, catalog, and reduce the number of counterfeit electronic parts in the NASA supply chain.

    (b) __Requirements__

            (C) regularly update employees on new threats, identification techniques, and reporting requirements; and

            (D) integrate industry associations, manufacturers, suppliers, and other Federal agencies, as appropriate;

        (2)

         an internal database to track all suspected and confirmed counterfeit electronic parts that will maintain, at a minimum—

            (D) identifying distinct lot and serial codes on external packaging;

            (E) radio frequency identification embedded into high-value parts;

            (F) physical destruction of all defective, damaged, and sub-standard parts that are by-products of the manufacturing process;

            (G) testing certifications;

            (H) maintenance of procedures for handling any counterfeit parts that slip through;

            (I) maintenance of secure facilities to prevent unauthorized access to proprietary information; and

            (J) maintenance of product return, buy back, and inventory control practices that limit counterfeiting.
