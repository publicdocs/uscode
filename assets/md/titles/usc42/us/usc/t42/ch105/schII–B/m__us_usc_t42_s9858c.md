                (ii) demonstrate that the State prepared a detailed report containing the results of the State market rates survey or alternative methodology conducted pursuant to clause (i), and made the results of the survey or alternative methodology widely available (not later than 30 days after the completion of such survey or alternative methodology) through periodic means, including posting the results on the Internet;

            (C) __Construction__

                    (I) geographic location of child care providers (such as location in an urban or rural area);

                    (II) the age or particular needs of children (such as the needs of children with disabilities and children served by child protective services);

                    (III) whether the providers provide child care services during weekend and other nontraditional hours; or

                    (IV) the State’s determination that such differentiated payment rates may enable a parent to choose high-quality child care that best fits the parent’s needs.

        (5) __Sliding fee scale__ 

            The State plan shall provide that the State will establish and periodically revise, by rule, a sliding fee scale that provides for cost sharing (that is not a barrier to families receiving assistance under this subchapter) by the families that receive child care services for which assistance is provided under this subchapter.

    (d) __Approval of application__ 

        The Secretary shall approve an application that satisfies the requirements of this section.
