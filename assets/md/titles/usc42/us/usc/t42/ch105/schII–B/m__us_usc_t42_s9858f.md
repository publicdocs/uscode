        (1) __Background check results__ 

            The State shall carry out the request of a child care provider for a criminal background check as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed 45 days after the date on which such request was submitted, and shall provide the results of the criminal background check to such provider and to the current or prospective staff member.

        (2) __Privacy__

                The State shall provide the results of the criminal background check to the provider in a statement that indicates whether a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member) is eligible or ineligible for employment described in subsection (c), without revealing any disqualifying crime or other related information regarding the individual.

The review process shall be consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ([42 U.S.C. 2000e][/us/usc/t42/s2000e] et seq.).

        (5) __No private right of action__

        (1) __Disqualification for other crimes__
