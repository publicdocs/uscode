                (i) __In general__

                (ii) __Waiver__

        (2) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Reduction__ 

                The amount of any reallotment to which a State is entitled to under paragraph (1) shall be reduced to the extent that it exceeds the amount that the Secretary estimates will be used in the State to carry out a State plan approved under [section 9858c(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9858c/d].

            (B) __Reallotments__ 

                The amount of such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among States for which no reduction in an allotment or reallotment is required by this subsection.
