    (b) __Health hazard assessment; priorities for remedial action__ 

        Within one year from November 8, 1978, the Secretary shall assess the potential health hazard to the public from the residual radioactive materials at designated processing sites.

            In making the designation under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator, the Commission and the State of South Dakota. The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the site so designated in the same manner and to the same extent as to the sites designated under subsection (a) of this section except that, in applying such provisions to such site, any reference in this subchapter to November 8, 1978, shall be treated as a reference to January 4, 1983, and in determining the State share under [section 7917 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7917] of the costs of remedial action, there shall be credited to the State, expenditures made by the State prior to January 4, 1983, which the Secretary determines would have been made by the State or the United States in carrying out the requirements of this subchapter.

    (f) __Designation of Moab Site as processing site__ 

        (1) __Designation__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Moab uranium milling site (referred to in this subsection as the “Moab site”) located approximately three miles northwest of Moab, Utah, and identified in the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March 1996 in conjunction with Source Materials License No. SUA–917, is designated as a processing site.

            (B) a reference in this subchapter to November 8, 1978, shall be treated as a reference to October 30, 2000.

        (3) __Remediation__ 

        Subject to the availability of appropriations for this purpose, the Secretary shall conduct remediation at the Moab site in a safe and environmentally sound manner that takes into consideration the remedial action plan prepared pursuant to section 3405(i) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 ([10 U.S.C. 7420][/us/usc/t10/s7420] note; [Public Law 105–261][/us/pl/105/261]), including—
