        (3) collect and report data in accordance with [section 300mm–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300mm–3]; and

        (4) meet such fraud, quality assurance, and other requirements as the WTC Program Administrator establishes, including sections 1320a–7 through 1320a–7e of this title, as applied by [section 300mm(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300mm/d].

    (c) __Training and technical assistance__ 

        The WTC Program Administer  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

            Not later than July 1, 2011, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a report on whether the Department of Veterans Affairs can provide monitoring and treatment services to individuals under this section more efficiently and effectively than through the nationwide network to be established under subsection (a).
