    (a) __In general__ 

    In approving applications made under [section 254f of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254f] for the assignment of Corps members, the Secretary shall—

        (1)

         give priority to any such application that—

            (A) is made regarding the provision of primary health services to a health professional shortage area with the greatest such shortage; and

            (B)

             is made by an entity that—

                (i) serves a health professional shortage area described in subparagraph (A);

                (ii) coordinates the delivery of primary health services with related health and social services;

                (iii) has a documented record of sound fiscal management; and

                (iv) will experience a negative impact on its capacity to provide primary health services if a Corps member is not assigned to the entity;

        (2) with respect to the geographic area in which the health professional shortage area is located, take into consideration the willingness of individuals in the geographic area, and of the appropriate governmental agencies or health entities in the area, to assist and cooperate with the Corps in providing effective primary health services; and

        (3) take into consideration comments of medical, osteopathic, dental, or other health professional societies whose members deliver services to the health professional shortage area, or if no such societies exist, comments of physicians, dentists, or other health professionals delivering services to the area.

    (b) __Establishment of criteria for determining priorities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish criteria specifying the manner in which the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section of the health professional shortage areas with the greatest such shortages.

        (1) __Proposed list__ 

            The Secretary shall prepare and publish a proposed list of health professional shortage areas and entities that would receive priority under subsection (a)(1) of this section in the assignment of Corps members. The list shall contain the information described in paragraph (2), and the relative scores and relative priorities of the entities submitting applications under [section 254f of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254f], in a proposed format. All such entities shall have 30 days after the date of publication of the list to provide additional data and information in support of inclusion on the list or in support of a higher priority determination and the Secretary shall reasonably consider such data and information in preparing the final list under paragraph (2).

        (2) __Preparation of list for applicable period__ 

        For the purpose of carrying out paragraph (3), the Secretary shall prepare and, as appropriate, update a list of health professional shortage areas and entities that are receiving priority under subsection (a)(1) of this section in the assignment of Corps members. Such list—

                (i) the entities provided such an authorization for the assignment of Corps members who are participating in the Scholarship Program;

                (ii) the entities provided such an authorization for the assignment of Corps members who are participating in the Loan Repayment Program; and

                (iii) the entities provided such an authorization for the assignment of Corps members who have become Corps members other than pursuant to contractual obligations under the Scholarship or Loan Repayment Programs.

                The Secretary may set forth such specifications by medical specialty.

        (3) __Notification of affected parties__ 

            (A) __Entities__ 

                Not later than 30 days after the Secretary has added to a list under paragraph (2) an entity specified as described in subparagraph (A) of such paragraph, the Secretary shall notify such entity that the entity has been provided an authorization to receive assignments of Corps members in the event that Corps members are available for the assignments.

        (4) __Revisions__ 

            If the Secretary proposes to make a revision in the list under paragraph (2), and the revision would adversely alter the status of an entity with respect to the list, the Secretary shall notify the entity of the revision. Any entity adversely affected by such a revision shall be notified in writing by the Secretary of the reasons for the revision and shall have 30 days from such notification to file a written appeal of the determination involved which shall be reasonably considered by the Secretary before the revision to the list becomes final.
