        (1) coordinates with public health and safety services, emergency medical services, medical facilities, trauma centers, and other entities in a region to develop an approach to emergency medical and trauma system access throughout the region, including 9–1–1 Public Safety Answering Points and emergency medical dispatch;

        (2) includes a mechanism, such as a regional medical direction or transport communications system, that operates throughout the region to ensure that the patient is taken to the medically appropriate facility (whether an initial facility or a higher-level facility) in a timely fashion;

        (3) allows for the tracking of prehospital and hospital resources, including inpatient bed capacity, emergency department capacity, trauma center capacity, on-call specialist coverage, ambulance diversion status, and the coordination of such tracking with regional communications and hospital destination decisions; and

        (4)

         includes a consistent region-wide prehospital, hospital, and interfacility data management system that—

            (A) submits data to the National EMS Information System, the National Trauma Data Bank, and others;

            (B) reports data to appropriate Federal and State databanks and registries; and

                (iii) coordinates prehospital treatment and triage, hospital destination, and interfacility transport throughout the region;

                (iv) includes a categorization or designation system for special medical facilities throughout the region that is integrated with transport and destination protocols;

                (v) includes a regional medical direction, patient tracking, and resource allocation system that supports day-to-day emergency care and surge capacity and is integrated with other components of the national and State emergency preparedness system; and

                (vi) addresses pediatric concerns related to integration, planning, preparedness, and coordination of emergency medical services for infants, children and adolescents; and

            (B) such other information as the Secretary may require.

    (e) __Requirement of matching funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may not make a grant under this section unless the State (or consortia of States) involved agrees, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the State (or consortia) in carrying out the purpose for which such grant was made, to make available non-Federal contributions (in cash or in kind under paragraph (2)) toward such costs in an amount equal to not less than $1 for each $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant. Such contributions may be made directly or through donations from public or private entities.

    (g) __Report__ 

    Not later than 90 days after the completion of a pilot project under subsection (a), the recipient of such contract or grant described in  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  shall submit to the Secretary a report containing the results of an evaluation of the program, including an identification of—

        (1) the impact of the regional, accountable emergency care and trauma system on patient health outcomes for various critical care categories, such as trauma, stroke, cardiac emergencies, neurological emergencies, and pediatric emergencies;

        (2) the system characteristics that contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the program (or lack thereof);

        (3) methods of assuring the long-term financial sustainability of the emergency care and trauma system;

        (4) the State and local legislation necessary to implement and to maintain the system;

        (5) the barriers to developing regionalized, accountable emergency care and trauma systems, as well as the methods to overcome such barriers; and
