    The Secretary may make a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] to a State only if—

        (1) the plan submitted under [section 300x–1(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–1/a] with respect to the grant and the report of the State under [section 300x–52(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–52/a] concerning the preceding fiscal year has been reviewed by the State mental health planning council under [section 300x–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–3]; and

        (2) the State submits to the Secretary any recommendations received by the State from such council for modifications to the plan (without regard to whether the State has made the recommended modifications) and any comments concerning the annual report.

    (b) __Maintenance of effort regarding State expenditures for mental health__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A funding agreement for a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] is that the State involved will maintain State expenditures for community mental health services at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant.

        (2) __Exclusion of certain funds__ 

            The Secretary may exclude from the aggregate State expenditures under subsection (a) of this section, funds appropriated to the principle agency for authorized activities which are of a non-recurring nature and for a specific purpose.

        (3) __Waiver__ 

            The Secretary may, upon the request of a State, waive the requirement established in paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that extraordinary economic conditions in the State justify the waiver.

        (4) __Noncompliance by State__ 

            (A) In making a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall make a determination of whether, for the previous fiscal year, the State maintained material compliance with the agreement made under paragraph (1). If the Secretary determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the State for the fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.

            (B) The Secretary may make a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for a fiscal year only if the State involved submits to the Secretary information sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination required in subparagraph (A).
