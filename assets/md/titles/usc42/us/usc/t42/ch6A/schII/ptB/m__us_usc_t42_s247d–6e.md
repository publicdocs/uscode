## § 247d–6e. Covered countermeasure process

    (a) __Establishment of Fund__ 

        Upon the issuance by the Secretary of a declaration under [section 247d–6d(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6d/b], there is hereby established in the Treasury an emergency fund designated as the “Covered Countermeasure Process Fund” for purposes of providing timely, uniform, and adequate compensation to eligible individuals for covered injuries directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure pursuant to such declaration, which Fund shall consist of such amounts designated as emergency appropriations under section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 of the 109th Congress, this emergency designation shall remain in effect through October 1, 2006.

    (b) __Payment of compensation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the Secretary issues a declaration under 247d–6d(b) of this title, the Secretary shall, after amounts have by law been provided for the Fund under subsection (a) of this section, provide compensation to an eligible individual for a covered injury directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure pursuant to such declaration.

        (2) __Elements of compensation__ 

            The compensation that shall be provided pursuant to paragraph (1) shall have the same elements, and be in the same amount, as is prescribed by sections 239c, 239d, and 239e of this title in the case of certain individuals injured as a result of administration of certain countermeasures against smallpox, except that [section 239e(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s239e/a/2/B] shall not apply.

        (3) __Rule of construction__ 

            Neither reasonable and necessary medical benefits nor lifetime total benefits for lost employment income due to permanent and total disability shall be limited by [section 239e of this title][/us/usc/t42/s239e].

        (4) __Determination of eligibility and compensation__ 

            Except as provided in this section, the procedures for determining, and for reviewing a determination of, whether an individual is an eligible individual, whether such individual has sustained a covered injury, whether compensation may be available under this section, and the amount of such compensation shall be those stated in [section 239a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s239a] (other than in subsection (d)(2) of such section), in regulations issued pursuant to that section, and in such additional or alternate regulations as the Secretary may promulgate for purposes of this section. In making determinations under this section, other than those described in paragraph (5)(A) as to the direct causation of a covered injury, the Secretary may only make such determination based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.

        (5) __Covered countermeasure injury table__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall by regulation establish a table identifying covered injuries that shall be presumed to be directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure and the time period in which the first symptom or manifestation of onset of each such adverse effect must manifest in order for such presumption to apply. The Secretary may only identify such covered injuries, for purpose of inclusion on the table, where the Secretary determines, based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence that administration or use of the covered countermeasure directly caused such covered injury.

            (B) __Amendments__ 

                The provisions of [section 239b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s239b] (other than a provision of subsection (a)(2) of such section that relates to accidental vaccinia inoculation) shall apply to the table established under this section.

            (C) __Judicial review__ 

                No court of the United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary under this paragraph.

        (6) __Meanings of terms__ 

        In applying sections 239a, 239b, 239c, 239d, and 239e of this title for purposes of this section—

            (A) the terms “vaccine” and “smallpox vaccine” shall be deemed to mean a covered countermeasure;

            (B) the terms “smallpox vaccine injury table” and “table established under [section 239b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s239b]” shall be deemed to refer to the table established under paragraph (4); and

            (C) other terms used in those sections shall have the meanings given to such terms by this section.

    (c) __Voluntary program__ 

        The Secretary shall ensure that a State, local, or Department of Health and Human Services plan to administer or use a covered countermeasure is consistent with any declaration under 247d–6d of this title and any applicable guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and that potential participants are educated with respect to contraindications, the voluntary nature of the program, and the availability of potential benefits and compensation under this part.

            The time limit for filing a civil action under [section 247d–6d(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6d/d] for an injury or death shall be tolled during the pendency of a claim for compensation under subsection (a) of this section.

        (3) __Rule of construction__ 

            This section shall not be construed as superseding or otherwise affecting the application of a requirement, under chapter 171 of title 28, to exhaust administrative remedies.

        (4) __Exclusivity__ 

            The remedy provided by subsection (a) of this section shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for any claim or suit this section encompasses, except for a proceeding under [section 247d–6d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6d].
