L. 100–607, title II, § 201(4)][/us/pl/100/607/s201/4], Nov. 4, 1988, [102 Stat. 3068][/us/stat/102/3068]; amended [Pub. L. 100–690, title II, § 2617(b)][/us/pl/100/690/s2617/b], Nov. 18, 1988, [102 Stat. 4240][/us/stat/102/4240]; [Pub. L. 101–93, § 6][/us/pl/101/93/s6], Aug. 16, 1989, [103 Stat. 615][/us/stat/103/615]; [Pub. L. 102–96, § 3][/us/pl/102/96/s3], Aug. 14, 1991, [105 Stat. 481][/us/stat/105/481].)

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 300cc–13, act July 1, 1944, § 2314, was successively renumbered by subsequent acts and transferred, see [section 238k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s238k].

 __Amendments__ 

    1991—[Pub. L. 102–96, § 3(1)][/us/pl/102/96/s3/1], substituted “Terry Beirn Community-Based AIDS Research Initiative” for “Community-based evaluations of experimental therapies” in section catchline.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 102–96, § 3(2)][/us/pl/102/96/s3/2], substituted “, schools of medicine and primary providers” for “and schools of medicine” in heading and substituted “schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, and existing consortia of primary care providers organized to conduct clinical research concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome” for “schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine”.

    Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 102–96, § 3(3)][/us/pl/102/96/s3/3], substituted “1996” for “1991” in pars. (1) and (2).

    1989—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 101–93][/us/pl/101/93] inserted “and osteopathic medicine” after “schools of medicine”.

    1988—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 100–690, § 2617(b)(1)][/us/pl/100/690/s2617/b/1], which directed substitution of “through the Director of the National Institute of Allergy” for “through the National Institutes of Allergy”, was executed by making substitution for “through the National Institute of Allergy” as the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsec. (b)(2)(B)(iii). [Pub. L. 100–690, § 2617(b)(2)][/us/pl/100/690/s2617/b/2], which directed substitution of “Institute” for “Institutes”, could not be executed because “Institute” was singular in original.

 __Effective Date of 1988 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] effective immediately after enactment of [Pub. L. 100–607][/us/pl/100/607], which was approved Nov. 4, 1988, see [section 2600 of Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690/s2600], set out as a note under [section 242m of this title][/us/usc/t42/s242m].

 __Reference to Community, Migrant, Public Housing, or Homeless Health Center Considered Reference to Health Center__

 __Findings and Sense of Congress__ 

[Pub. L. 102–96, § 2][/us/pl/102/96/s2], Aug. 14, 1991, [105 Stat. 481][/us/stat/105/481], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Findings__  __.—__ 

>     Congress finds that—

>         “(1) community-based clinical trials complement the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ university-based research in order to provide increased access to experimental therapies;

>         “(2) community-based clinical trials provide an efficient and cost-effective means to develop new HIV-related treatments, benefiting all people living with HIV disease and other illnesses; and

>         “(3) because the community-based clinical trials model has a proven ability to conduct rapid trials that meet the very highest standards of scientific inquiry, this program should be reauthorized and significantly expanded.

>     “(b)  __Sense of Congress__  __.—__ 

>     It is the sense of Congress that, because of Terry Beirn’s tireless efforts to foster a partnership among all parties invested in AIDS research (including the National Institutes of Health university-based research system, primary care physicians practicing in the community, and patients), the community-based clinical trials program should be renamed as the ‘Terry Beirn Community-Based AIDS Research Initiative’ in his honor.”
