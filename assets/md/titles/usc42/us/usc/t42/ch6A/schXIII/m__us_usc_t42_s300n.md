    (a) __Priority for low-income women__ 

        The Secretary may not make a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] unless the State involved agrees that low-income women will be given priority in the provision of services and activities pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a].

    (b) __Limitation on imposition of fees for services__

        (1) will be made according to a schedule of charges that is made available to the public;

        (2) will be adjusted to reflect the income of the woman involved; and

        (3) will not be imposed on any woman with an income of less than 100 percent of the official poverty line, as established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and revised by the Secretary in accordance with [section 9902(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9902/2].

        (2) __Waiver__ 

            The Secretary may waive the requirement established in paragraph (1) for a State if the Secretary determines that compliance by the State with the requirement would result in an inefficient allocation of resources with respect to carrying out the purpose described in [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a].

        (3) __Grants to tribes and tribal organizations__ 

            (A) The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to tribes and tribal organizations (as such terms are used in paragraph (1)) for the purpose of carrying out programs described in [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a]. This subchapter applies to such a grant (in relation to the jurisdiction of the tribe or organization) to the same extent and in the same manner as such subchapter applies to a grant to a State under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] (in relation to the jurisdiction of the State).

            (B) If a tribe or tribal organization is receiving a grant under subparagraph (A) and the State in which the tribe or organization is located is receiving a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k], the requirement established in paragraph (1) for the State regarding the tribe or organization is deemed to have been waived under paragraph (2).

    (d) __Relationship to items and services under other programs__ 

    The Secretary may not make a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] unless the State involved agrees that the grant will not be expended to make payment for any item or service to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to such item or service—

        (1) under any State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program; or
