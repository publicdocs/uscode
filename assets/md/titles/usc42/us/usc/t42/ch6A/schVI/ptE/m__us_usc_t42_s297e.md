        (1) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to such balance in such fund on the date of termination of the fund as the total amount of the Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary pursuant to [section 297a(b)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s297a/b/2/A] bears to the total amount in such fund derived from such Federal capital contributions and from funds deposited therein pursuant to [section 297a(b)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s297a/b/2/B].

        (2) The remainder of such balance shall be paid to the school.

    (b) __Payment of principal or interest on loans__ 

        If a capital distribution is made under subsection (a) of this section, the school involved shall, after such capital distribution, pay to the Secretary, not less often than quarterly, the same proportionate share of amounts received by the school in payment of principal or interest on loans made from the loan fund established under [section 297a(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s297a/b] as determined by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.

The remainder of such balance shall be paid to the school.
