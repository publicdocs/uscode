> “The Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, ongoing medical intervention.

>     “(2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.

>     “(3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma; 6,300,000 children under age 18 had asthma.

>     “(4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are in the African-American population.

>     “(5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).

>     “(6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).

>     “(7) In 2000, 4,487 people died from asthma, and of these 223 were children.

>     “(8) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma is a common cause of missed school days, accounting for approximately 14,000,000 missed school days annually.

>     “(9) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, working parents of children with asthma lose an estimated $1,000,000,000 a year in productivity.

>     “(10) At least 30 States have legislation protecting the rights of children to carry and self-administer asthma metered-dose inhalers, and at least 18 States expand this protection to epinephrine auto-injectors.

>     “(11) Tragic refusals of schools to permit students to carry their inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine have occurred, some resulting in death and spawning litigation.

>     “(12) School district medication policies must be developed with the safety of all students in mind. The immediate and correct use of asthma inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine are necessary to avoid serious respiratory complications and improve health care outcomes.

>     “(13) No school should interfere with the patient-physician relationship.

>     “(14) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic allergic reaction that can kill within minutes. Anaphylaxis occurs in some asthma patients. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, people who have experienced symptoms of anaphylaxis previously are at risk for subsequent reactions and should carry an epinephrine auto-injector with them at all times, if prescribed.

>     “(15) An increasing number of students and school staff have life-threatening allergies. Exposure to the affecting allergen can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires prompt medical intervention with an injection of epinephrine.”
