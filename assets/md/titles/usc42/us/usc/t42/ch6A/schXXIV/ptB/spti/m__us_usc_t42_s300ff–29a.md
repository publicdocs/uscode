## § 300ff–29a. Supplemental grants

    (a) __In general__ 

    For the purpose of providing services described in [section 300ff–22(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–22/a], the Secretary shall make grants to States—

        (1) whose applications under [section 300ff–27 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–27] have demonstrated the need in the State, on an objective and quantified basis, for supplemental financial assistance to provide such services; and

        (2) that did not, for the most recent grant year pursuant to section 300ff–28(a)(1) or 300ff–28(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title for which data is available, have more than 5 percent of grant funds under such sections canceled, offset under [section 300ff–31a(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–31a/e], or covered by any waivers under [section 300ff–31a(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–31a/c].

    (b) __Demonstrated need__ 

    The factors considered by the Secretary in determining whether an eligible area has a demonstrated need for purposes of subsection (a)(1) may include any or all of the following:

        (1) The unmet need for such services, as determined under [section 300ff–27(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–27/b].

        (2) An increasing need for HIV/AIDS-related services, including relative rates of increase in the number of cases of HIV/AIDS.

        (3) The relative rates of increase in the number of cases of HIV/AIDS within new or emerging subpopulations.

        (4) The current prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

        (5) Relevant factors related to the cost and complexity of delivering health care to individuals with HIV/AIDS in the eligible area.

        (6) The impact of co-morbid factors, including co-occurring conditions, determined relevant by the Secretary.

        (7) The prevalence of homelessness.

        (8) The prevalence of individuals described under [section 300ff–12(b)(2)(M) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–12/b/2/M].

        (9) The relevant factors that limit access to health care, including geographic variation, adequacy of health insurance coverage, and language barriers.

        (10) The impact of a decline in the amount received pursuant to [section 300ff–28 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–28] on services available to all individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under this subchapter.

    (c) __Priority in making grants__ 

        The Secretary shall provide funds under this section to a State to address the decline in services related to the decline in the amounts received pursuant to [section 300ff–28 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–28] consistent with the grant award to the State for fiscal year 2006, to the extent that the factor under subsection (b)(10) (relating to a decline in funding) applies to the State.

    (d) __Report on the awarding of supplemental funds__ 

    Not later than 45 days after the awarding of supplemental funds under this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report concerning such funds. Such report shall include information detailing—

        (1) the total amount of supplemental funds available under this section for the year involved;

        (2) the amount of supplemental funds used in accordance with the hold harmless provisions of [section 300ff–28(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–28/a/2];

        (3) the amount of supplemental funds disbursed pursuant to subsection (c);

        (4) the disbursement of the remainder of the supplemental funds after taking into account the uses described in paragraphs (2) and (3); and

        (5) the rationale used for the amount of funds disbursed as described under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).

    (e) __Core medical services__ 

        The provisions of [section 300ff–22(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–22/b] apply with respect to a grant under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as such provisions apply with respect to a grant made pursuant to [section 300ff–28(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–28/a/1].

    (f) __Applicability of grant authority__ 

        The authority to make grants under this section applies beginning with the first fiscal year for which amounts are made available for such grants under [section 300ff–31b(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–31b/b/1].
