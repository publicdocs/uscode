            With respect to compliance with the agreement made under subsection (a) of this section, a State may expend a grant under [section 300x–21 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–21] to provide inpatient hospital services as treatment for substance abuse only if it has been determined, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Secretary, that such treatment is a medical necessity for the individual involved, and that the individual cannot be effectively treated in a community-based, nonhospital, residential program of treatment.

        (2) __Rate of payment__

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may provide to any State a waiver of the restriction established in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section for the purpose of authorizing the State to expend a grant under [section 300x–21 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–21] for the construction of a new facility or rehabilitation of an existing facility, but not for land acquisition.

        (2) __Standard regarding need for waiver__

        (3) __Amount__ 

            In granting a waiver under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall allow the use of a specified amount of funds to construct or rehabilitate a specified number of beds for residential treatment and a specified number of slots for outpatient treatment, based on reasonable estimates by the State of the costs of construction or rehabilitation. In considering waiver applications, the Secretary shall ensure that the State has carefully designed a program that will minimize the costs of additional beds.

        (4) __Matching funds__ 

            The Secretary may grant a waiver under paragraph (1) only if the State agrees, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the State in carrying out the purpose of the waiver, to make available non-Federal contributions in cash toward such costs in an amount equal to not less than $1 for each $1 of Federal funds provided under [section 300x–21 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–21].

        (5) __Date certain for acting upon request__ 

            The Secretary shall act upon a request for a waiver under paragraph (1) not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made.
