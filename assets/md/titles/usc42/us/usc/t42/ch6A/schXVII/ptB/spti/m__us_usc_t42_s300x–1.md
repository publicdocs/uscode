## § 300x–1. State plan for comprehensive community mental health services for certain individuals

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary may make a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] only if—

        (1) the State involved submits to the Secretary a plan for providing comprehensive community mental health services to adults with a serious mental illness and to children with a serious emotional disturbance;

        (2) the plan meets the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this section; and

        (3) the plan is approved by the Secretary.

    (b) __Criteria for plan__ 

    With respect to the provision of comprehensive community mental health services to individuals who are either adults with a serious mental illness or children with a serious emotional disturbance, the criteria referred to in subsection (a) of this section regarding a plan are as follows:

        (1) __Comprehensive community-based mental health systems__ 

            The plan provides for an organized community-based system of care for individuals with mental illness and describes available services and resources in a comprehensive system of care, including services for dually diagnosed individuals. The description of the system of care shall include health and mental health services, rehabilitation services, employment services, housing services, educational services, substance abuse services, medical and dental care, and other support services to be provided to individuals with Federal, State and local public and private resources to enable such individuals to function outside of inpatient or residential institutions to the maximum extent of their capabilities, including services to be provided by local school systems under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \[[20 U.S.C. 1400][/us/usc/t20/s1400] et seq.\]. The plan shall include a separate description of case management services and provide for activities leading to reduction of hospitalization.

        (2) __Mental health system data and epidemiology__ 

            The plan contains an estimate of the incidence and prevalence in the State of serious mental illness among adults and serious emotional disturbance among children and presents quantitative targets to be achieved in the implementation of the system described in paragraph (1).

        (3) __Children’s services__ 

        In the case of children with serious emotional disturbance, the plan—

            (A) subject to subparagraph (B), provides for a system of integrated social services, educational services, juvenile services, and substance abuse services that, together with health and mental health services, will be provided in order for such children to receive care appropriate for their multiple needs (such system to include services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \[[20 U.S.C. 1400][/us/usc/t20/s1400] et seq.\]);

            (B) provides that the grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the fiscal year involved will not be expended to provide any service under such system other than comprehensive community mental health services; and

            (C) provides for the establishment of a defined geographic area for the provision of the services of such system.

        (4) __Targeted services to rural and homeless populations__ 

            The plan describes the State’s outreach to and services for individuals who are homeless and how community-based services will be provided to individuals residing in rural areas.

        (5) __Management systems__ 

            The plan describes the financial resources, staffing and training for mental health providers that is necessary to implement the plan, and provides for the training of providers of emergency health services regarding mental health. The plan further describes the manner in which the State intends to expend the grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the fiscal year involved.

        Except as provided for in paragraph (3), the State plan shall contain the information required under this subsection with respect to both adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbance.

    (c) __Definitions regarding mental illness and emotional disturbance; methods for estimate of incidence and prevalence__ 

        (1) __Establishment by Secretary of definitions; dissemination__ 

            For purposes of this subpart, the Secretary shall establish definitions for the terms “adults with a serious mental illness” and “children with a serious emotional disturbance”. The Secretary shall disseminate the definitions to the States.

        (2) __Standardized methods__ 

            The Secretary shall establish standardized methods for making the estimates required in subsection (b)(11)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this section with respect to a State. A funding agreement for a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the State is that the State will utilize such methods in making the estimates.

        (3) __Date certain for compliance by Secretary__ 

            Not later than 90 days after July 10, 1992, the Secretary shall establish the definitions described in paragraph (1), shall begin dissemination of the definitions to the States, and shall establish the standardized methods described in paragraph (2).

    (d) __Requirement of implementation of plan__ 

        (1) __Complete implementation__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), in making a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall make a determination of the extent to which the State has implemented the plan required in subsection (a) of this section. If the Secretary determines that a State has not completely implemented the plan, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the State for the fiscal year involved by an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount determined under [section 300x–7 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–7] for the State for the fiscal year.

        (2) __Substantial implementation and good faith effort regarding fiscal year 1993__ 

            (A) In making a grant under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] to a State for fiscal year 1993, the Secretary shall make a determination of the extent to which the State has implemented the plan required in subsection (a) of this section. If the Secretary determines that the State has not substantially implemented the plan, the Secretary shall, subject to subparagraph (B), reduce the amount of the allotment under [section 300x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x] for the State for such fiscal year by an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount determined under [section 300x–7 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–7] for the State for the fiscal year.

            (B) In carrying out subparagraph (A), if the Secretary determines that the State is making a good faith effort to implement the plan required in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may make a reduction under such subparagraph in an amount that is less than the amount specified in such subparagraph, except that the reduction may not be made in an amount that is less than 5 percent of the amount determined under [section 300x–7 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300x–7] for the State for fiscal year 1993.
