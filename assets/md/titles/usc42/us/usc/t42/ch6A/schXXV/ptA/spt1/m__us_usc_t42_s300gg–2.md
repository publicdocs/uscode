## § 300gg–2. Guaranteed renewability of coverage

    (a) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in this section, if a health insurance issuer offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market, the issuer must renew or continue in force such coverage at the option of the plan sponsor or the individual, as applicable.

    (b) __General exceptions__ 

    A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage offered in connection with a health insurance coverage offered in the group or individual market based only on one or more of the following:

        (1) __Nonpayment of premiums__ 

            The plan sponsor, or individual, as applicable, has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health insurance coverage or the issuer has not received timely premium payments.

        (2) __Fraud__ 

            The plan sponsor, or individual, as applicable, has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.

        (3) __Violation of participation or contribution rates__ 

            In the case of a group health plan, the plan sponsor has failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules, pursuant to applicable State law.

        (4) __Termination of coverage__ 

            The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in such market in accordance with subsection (c) of this section and applicable State law.

        (5) __Movement outside service area__ 

            In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, there is no longer any enrollee in connection with such plan who lives, resides, or works in the service area of the issuer (or in the area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) and, in the case of the small group market, the issuer would deny enrollment with respect to such plan under section 2711(c)(1)(A). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (6) __Association membership ceases__ 

            In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the small or large group market (as the case may be) only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor relating to any covered individual.

    (c) __Requirements for uniform termination of coverage__ 

        (1) __Particular type of coverage not offered__ 

        In any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a particular type of group or individual health insurance coverage, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer in accordance with applicable State law in such market only if—

            (A) the issuer provides notice to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, provided coverage of this type in such market (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 90 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage;

            (B) the issuer offers to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, provided coverage of this type in such market, the option to purchase all (or, in the case of the large group market, any) other health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer to a group health plan or individual health insurance coverage in such market; and

            (C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to the claims experience of those sponsors or individuals, as applicable, or any health status-related factor relating to any participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.

        (2) __Discontinuance of all coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the individual or group market, or all markets, in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only in accordance with applicable State law and if—

                (i) the issuer provides notice to the applicable State authority and to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. </sup></sup>  (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 180 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage; and

                (ii) all health insurance issued or delivered for issuance in the State in such market (or markets) are discontinued and coverage under such health insurance coverage in such market (or markets) is not renewed.

            (B) __Prohibition on market reentry__ 

                In the case of a discontinuation under subparagraph (A) in a market, the issuer may not provide for the issuance of any health insurance coverage in the market and State involved during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health insurance coverage not so renewed.

    (d) __Exception for uniform modification of coverage__ 

    At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group health plan—

        (1) in the large group market; or

        (2) in the small group market if, for coverage that is available in such market other than only through one or more bona fide associations, such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product.

    (e) __Application to coverage offered only through associations__ 

        In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only through one or more associations, a reference to “plan sponsor” is deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer member of the association, to include a reference to such employer.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 2703 of act July 1, 1944, was successively renumbered by subsequent acts and transferred, see [section 238b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s238b].

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—[Pub. L. 111–148, § 1563(c)(9)][/us/pl/111/148/s1563/c/9], formerly § 1562(c)(9), as renumbered by [Pub. L. 111–148, § 10107(b)(1)][/us/pl/111/148/s10107/b/1], transferred [section 300gg–12 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–12] to the end of this section after amending it by striking out the section catchline “Guaranteed renewability of coverage for employers in group market”, by striking subsec. (a) which required a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan to renew such coverage at the option of the plan sponsor, by amending subsec. (b) by substituting “health insurance coverage offered in the group or individual market” for “group health plan in the small or large group market” in introductory provisions, inserting “, or individual, as applicable,” after “plan sponsor” in pars. (1) and (2), adding par. (3), and striking out former par. (3) which related to violation of participation or contribution rules, and by amending subsec. (c) by substituting “group or individual health insurance coverage” for “group health insurance coverage offered in the small or large group market” in introductory provisions of par. (1), inserting “or individual, as applicable,” after “plan sponsor” in par. (1)(A) and (B), inserting “or individual health insurance coverage” in par. (1)(B), inserting “or individuals, as applicable,” after “those sponsors” in par. (1)(C), substituting “individual or group market, or all markets,” for “small group market or the large group market, or both markets,” in introductory provisions of par. (2)(A), and inserting “or individual, as applicable,” after “plan sponsor” in par. (2)(A)(i). Amendment inserting “or individual health insurance coverage” in subsec. (c)(1)(B) was executed by making the insertion after “group health plan” as the probable intent of Congress, notwithstanding that the directory language did not specify where in subsec. (c)(1)(B) to make the insertion.

 __Effective Date__ 

    Section effective for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2014, see [section 1255 of Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148/s1255], set out as a note under [section 300gg of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg].
