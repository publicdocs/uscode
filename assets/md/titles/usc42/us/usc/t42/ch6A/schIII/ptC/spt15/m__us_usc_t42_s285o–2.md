        (1)

         the application contains or is supported by reasonable assurances that—

            (A) the applicant has the experience, or capability, to conduct, through biomedical, behavioral, social, and related disciplines, long-term research on drug abuse and to provide coordination of such research among such disciplines;

            (B) the applicant has available to it sufficient facilities (including laboratory, reference, and data analysis facilities) to carry out the research plan contained in the application;

            (C) the applicant has facilities and personnel to provide training in the prevention and treatment of drug abuse;

            (D) the applicant has the capacity to train predoctoral and postdoctoral students for careers in research on drug abuse;

            (E) the applicant has the capacity to conduct courses on drug abuse problems and research on drug abuse for undergraduate and graduate students, and medical and osteopathic, nursing, social work, and other specialized graduate students; and

            (F) the applicant has the capacity to conduct programs of continuing education in such medical, legal, and social service fields as the Secretary may require. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The period probably should be “; and”. </sup></sup> 

        (2) the application contains a detailed five-year plan for research relating to drug abuse.

    (b) __Grants__

No funds provided under a grant under this subsection may be used for the purchase of any land or the purchase, construction, preservation, or repair of any building. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “construction” has the meaning given that term by section 292a(1)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

    (c) __Drug abuse and addiction research__

        (2) __Use of funds__ 

        Amounts made available under a grant or cooperative agreement under paragraph (1) for drug abuse and addiction may be used for research and clinical trials relating to—

            (A) the effects of drug abuse on the human body, including the brain;

        (3) __Research results__ 

            The Director shall promptly disseminate research results under this subsection to Federal, State, and local entities involved in combating drug abuse and addiction.
