Such amounts as the Secretary may determine to represent a reasonable distribution of estimated costs among the various appropriations involved may be advanced each year to this fund and shall be available for expenditure for such costs under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary: Provided, That funds advanced to this fund shall be available only in the fiscal year in which they are advanced: Provided further, That final adjustments of advances in accordance with actual costs shall be effected wherever practicable with the appropriations from which such funds are advanced.
