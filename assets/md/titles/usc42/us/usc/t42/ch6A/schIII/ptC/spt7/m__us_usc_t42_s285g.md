>         “(B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all individuals through optimal rehabilitation.

>     “(2)

>      The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has made unparalleled contributions to the advancement of child health and human development, including significant efforts to—

>         “(A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV transmission;

>         “(B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) vaccine, credited with nearly eliminating the incidence of intellectual disabilities; and

>         “(C) conduct intramural research, support extramural research, and train thousands of child health and human development researchers who have contributed greatly to dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.

>     “(4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless advocate for children with special needs, whose foresight in creating the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development gave life to the words of President Kennedy, who wished to ‘encourage imaginative research into the complex processes of human development from conception to old age.’ ”
