## § 300gg–23. Preemption; State flexibility; construction

    (a) __Continued applicability of State law with respect to health insurance issuers__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2) and except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, this part and part C of this subchapter insofar as it relates to this part shall not be construed to supersede any provision of State law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect any standard or requirement solely relating to health insurance issuers in connection with individual or group health insurance coverage except to the extent that such standard or requirement prevents the application of a requirement of this part.

        (2) __Continued preemption with respect to group health plans__ 

            Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect or modify the provisions of [section 1144 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s1144] with respect to group health plans.

    (b) __Special rules in case of portability requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), the provisions of this part relating to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer supersede any provision of State law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect a standard or requirement applicable to imposition of a preexisting condition exclusion specifically governed by section 701  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  which differs from the standards or requirements specified in such section.

        (2) __Exceptions__ 

        Only in relation to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, the provisions of this part do not supersede any provision of State law to the extent that such provision—

            (i) substitutes for the reference to “6-month period” in section 2701(a)(1) 1 a reference to any shorter period of time;

            (ii) substitutes for the reference to “12 months” and “18 months” in section 2701(a)(2) 1 a reference to any shorter period of time;

            (iii) substitutes for the references to “63” days in sections 2701(c)(2)(A) 1 and 2701(d)(4)(A) 1 a reference to any greater number of days;

            (iv) substitutes for the reference to “30-day period” in sections 2701(b)(2) 1 and 2701(d)(1) 1 a reference to any greater period;

            (v) prohibits the imposition of any preexisting condition exclusion in cases not described in section 2701(d) 1 or expands the exceptions described in such section;

            (vi) requires special enrollment periods in addition to those required under section 2701(f) 1; or

            (vii) reduces the maximum period permitted in an affiliation period under section 2701(g)(1)(B) 1.

    (c) __Rules of construction__ 

        Nothing in this part (other than section 2704) 1 shall be construed as requiring a group health plan or health insurance coverage to provide specific benefits under the terms of such plan or coverage.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __State law__ 

            The term “State law” includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State. A law of the United States applicable only to the District of Columbia shall be treated as a State law rather than a law of the United States.

        (2) __State__ 

            The term “State” includes a State (including the Northern Mariana Islands), any political subdivisions of a State or such Islands, or any agency or instrumentality of either.
