## § 254c–8. Healthy start for infants

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Continuation and expansion of program__ 

            The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, shall under authority of this section continue in effect the Healthy Start Initiative and may, during fiscal year 2001 and subsequent years, carry out such program on a national basis.

        (2) __Definition__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “Healthy Start Initiative” is a reference to the program that, as an initiative to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes, makes grants for project areas with high annual rates of infant mortality and that, prior to the effective date of this section, was a demonstration program carried out under [section 241 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s241].

    (b) __Considerations in making grants__ 

        (1) __Requirements__ 

            In making grants under subsection (a), the Secretary shall require that applicants (in addition to meeting all eligibility criteria established by the Secretary) establish, for project areas under such subsection, community-based consortia of individuals and organizations (including agencies responsible for administering block grant programs under title V of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t42/s701] et seq.\], consumers of project services, public health departments, hospitals, health centers under [section 254b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254b], and other significant sources of health care services) that are appropriate for participation in projects under subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) __Other considerations__ 

        In making grants under subsection (a), the Secretary shall take into consideration the following:

            (A) Factors that contribute to infant mortality, such as low birthweight.

            (B)

             The extent to which applicants for such grants facilitate—

                (i) a community-based approach to the delivery of services; and

                (ii) a comprehensive approach to women’s health care to improve perinatal outcomes.

        (3) __Special projects__ 

            Nothing in paragraph (2) shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from awarding grants under subsection (a) for special projects that are intended to address significant disparities in perinatal health indicators in communities along the United States-Mexico border or in Alaska or Hawaii.

    (c) __Coordination__ 

        Recipients of grants under subsection (a) of this section shall coordinate their services and activities with the State agency or agencies that administer block grant programs under title V of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t42/s701] et seq.\] in order to promote cooperation, integration, and dissemination of information with Statewide systems and with other community services funded under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant.

    (d) __Rule of construction__ 

        Except to the extent inconsistent with this section, this section may not be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary to make modifications in the program carried out under subsection (a) of this section.

    (e) __Funding__ 

        (1) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        For the purpose of carrying out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated—

            (A) $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and

            (B) for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the amount authorized for the preceding fiscal year increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for such year.

        (2) __Allocation__ 

            (A) __Program administration__ 

                Of the amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary may reserve up to 5 percent for coordination, dissemination, technical assistance, and data activities that are determined by the Secretary to be appropriate for carrying out the program under this section.

            (B) __Evaluation__ 

                Of the amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary may reserve up to 1 percent for evaluations of projects carried out under subsection (a). Each such evaluation shall include a determination of whether such projects have been effective in reducing the disparity in health status between the general population and individuals who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups.
