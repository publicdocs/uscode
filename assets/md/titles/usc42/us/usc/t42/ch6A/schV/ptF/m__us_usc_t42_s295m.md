The Secretary may not enter into a contract under this subchapter with any such school or training center unless the school, training center, or graduate program furnishes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that it will not discriminate on the basis of sex in the admission of individuals to its training programs.

        the provisions of the preceding sentences of this section shall apply only with respect to a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or interest subsidy to, or for the benefit of such a school for a fiscal year beginning after June 30, 1979.
