                    (II) that without a grant under subparagraph (A) there would be a disruption of the provision of health care to low-income individuals.

        (2) The amount of any grant under paragraph (1) may not exceed 75 per centum of the cost of the project for which the grant is made unless the project is located in an area determined by the Secretary to be an urban or rural poverty area, in which case the grant may cover up to 100 per centum of such costs.
