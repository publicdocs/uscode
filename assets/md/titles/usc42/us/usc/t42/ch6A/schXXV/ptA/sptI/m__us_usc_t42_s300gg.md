## § 300gg. Fair health insurance premiums

    (a)  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. No subsec. (b) has been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Prohibiting discriminatory premium rates__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        With respect to the premium rate charged by a health insurance issuer for health insurance coverage offered in the individual or small group market—

            (A)

             such rate shall vary with respect to the particular plan or coverage involved only by—

                (i) whether such plan or coverage covers an individual or family;

                (ii) rating area, as established in accordance with paragraph (2);

                (iii) age, except that such rate shall not vary by more than 3 to 1 for adults (consistent with [section 300gg–6(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–6/c]); and

                (iv) tobacco use, except that such rate shall not vary by more than 1.5 to 1; and

            (B) such rate shall not vary with respect to the particular plan or coverage involved by any other factor not described in subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Rating area__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Each State shall establish 1 or more rating areas within that State for purposes of applying the requirements of this subchapter.

            (B) __Secretarial review__ 

                The Secretary shall review the rating areas established by each State under subparagraph (A) to ensure the adequacy of such areas for purposes of carrying out the requirements of this subchapter. If the Secretary determines a State’s rating areas are not adequate, or that a State does not establish such areas, the Secretary may establish rating areas for that State.

        (3) __Permissible age bands__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall define the permissible age bands for rating purposes under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).

        (4) __Application of variations based on age or tobacco use__ 

            With respect to family coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage, the rating variations permitted under clauses (iii) and (iv) of paragraph (1)(A) shall be applied based on the portion of the premium that is attributable to each family member covered under the plan or coverage.

        (5) __Special rule for large group market__ 

            If a State permits health insurance issuers that offer coverage in the large group market in the State to offer such coverage through the State Exchange (as provided for under [section 18032(f)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18032/f/2/B]), the provisions of this subsection shall apply to all coverage offered in such market (other than self-insured group health plans offered in such market) in the State.
