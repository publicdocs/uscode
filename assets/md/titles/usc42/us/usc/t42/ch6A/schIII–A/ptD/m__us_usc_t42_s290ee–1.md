    (a) __Program authorized__ 

        The Secretary shall make grants to States, local governmental entities, and Indian tribes and tribal organizations (as defined in [section 450b of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s450b]) to allow first responders and members of other key community sectors to administer a drug or device approved or cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose.

    (b) __Application__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        An entity seeking a grant under this section shall submit an application to the Secretary—

            (A) that meets the criteria under paragraph (2); and

            (B) at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may require.

        (2) __Criteria__ 

        An entity, in submitting an application under paragraph (1), shall—

            (A) describe the evidence-based methodology and outcome measurements that will be used to evaluate the program funded with a grant under this section, and specifically explain how such measurements will provide valid measures of the impact of the program;

            (B) describe how the program could be broadly replicated if demonstrated to be effective;

            (C) identify the governmental and community agencies with which the entity will coordinate to implement the program; and

            (D) describe how the entity will ensure that law enforcement agencies will coordinate with their corresponding State substance abuse and mental health agencies to identify protocols and resources that are available to overdose victims and families, including information on treatment and recovery resources.

    (c) __Use of funds__ 

    An entity shall use a grant received under this section to—

        (1) make a drug or device approved or cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose available to be carried and administered by first responders and members of other key community sectors;

        (2) train and provide resources for first responders and members of other key community sectors on carrying and administering a drug or device approved or cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose; and

        (3) establish processes, protocols, and mechanisms for referral to appropriate treatment, which may include an outreach coordinator or team to connect individuals receiving opioid overdose reversal drugs to followup services.
