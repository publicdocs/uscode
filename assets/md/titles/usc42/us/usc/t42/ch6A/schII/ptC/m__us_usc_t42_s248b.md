    (b) __Proposals for transfer or financial self-sufficiency__ 

        Not later than July 1, 1981, the Secretary shall notify each Service hospital and other station, and the chief executive officer of each State and of each locality in which such a hospital or other station is located, that the Secretary will accept proposals for the transfer of each such hospital and station from the Service to a public (including Federal) or nonprofit private entity or for the achievement of financial self-sufficiency of each such hospital and station not later than September 30, 1982. No such proposal shall be considered by the Secretary if it is submitted later than September 1, 1981.

    (c) __Evaluation of proposals__ 

    The Secretary shall evaluate promptly each proposal submitted under subsection (b) of this section with respect to a hospital or other station and determine, not later than September 30, 1981, whether or not under such proposal the hospital or station—

        (1) will be maintained as a general health care facility providing a range of services to the population within its service area,

        (2) will continue to make services available to existing patient populations, and

        (3) has a reasonable expectation of financial viability and, in the case of a hospital or station that is not proposed to be transferred, of financial self-sufficiency.

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a proposal for the transfer of a discrete, minor, freestanding part of a hospital or station to a local public entity for the purpose of continuing the provision of services to refugees.

    (d) __Rejection or approval of proposal__ 

        (1) If the Secretary determines that a proposal for a hospital or other station does not meet the standards of subsection (c) of this section or if there is no proposal submitted under subsection (b) of this section with respect to a hospital or other station, the Secretary shall provide for the closure of the hospital or station by not later than October 31, 1981.

        (2)

         If the Secretary determines that a proposal for a hospital or other station meets the standards of subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall take such steps, within the amounts available through appropriations, as may be necessary and proper—

            (A) to operate (or participate or assist in the operation of) the hospital or station by the Service until the transfer is accomplished or financial self-sufficiency is achieved,

            (B) to bring the hospital or station into compliance with applicable licensure, accreditation, and local medical practice standards, and

            (C) to provide for such other legal, administrative, personnel, and financial arrangements (including allowing payments made with respect to services provided by the hospital or station to be made directly to that hospital or station) as may be necessary to effect a timely and orderly transfer of such hospital or station (including the land, building, and equipment thereof) from the Service, or for the financial self-sufficiency of the hospital or station, not later than September 30, 1982.

    (e) __Establishment of identifiable administrative unit__ 

        There is established, within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, an identifiable administrative unit which shall have direct responsibility and authority for overseeing the activities under this section.

    (f) __Finding of financial self-sufficiency__ 

        For purposes of this section, a hospital or station cannot be found to be financially self-sufficient if the hospital or station is relying, in whole or in part, on direct appropriated funds for its continued operations.
