        (2) __Waiver__ 

            (A) Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may provide to the State a waiver of all or part of the requirement established in paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the State is providing an adequate level of comprehensive community mental health services for children with a serious emotional distrubance, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “disturbance,”. </sup></sup>  as indicated by a comparison of the number of such children for which such services are sought with the availability in the State of the services.

            (B) The Secretary shall approve or deny a request for a waiver under subparagraph (A) not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made.

            (C) Any waiver provided by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall be applicable only to the fiscal year involved.

            (D) Day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, or psychosocial rehabilitation services.
