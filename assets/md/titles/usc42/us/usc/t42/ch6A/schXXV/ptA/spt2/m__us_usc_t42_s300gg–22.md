        (1) __State authority__ 

            Subject to section 300gg–23  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, each State may require that health insurance issuers that issue, sell, renew, or offer health insurance coverage in the State in the individual or group market meet the requirements of this part with respect to such issuers.

        (2) __Failure to implement provisions__ 

            In the case of a determination by the Secretary that a State has failed to substantially enforce a provision (or provisions) in this part with respect to health insurance issuers in the State, the Secretary shall enforce such provision (or provisions) under subsection (b) of this section insofar as they relate to the issuance, sale, renewal, and offering of health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans or individual health insurance coverage in such State.

    (b) __Secretarial enforcement authority__ 

        (1) __Limitation__ 

        The provisions of this subsection shall apply to enforcement of a provision (or provisions) of this part only—

            (A) as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section; and

            (B) with respect to individual health insurance coverage or group health plans that are non-Federal governmental plans.

        (2) __Imposition of penalties__ 

        In the cases described in paragraph (1)—

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, any non-Federal governmental plan that is a group health plan and any health insurance issuer that fails to meet a provision of this part applicable to such plan or issuer is subject to a civil money penalty under this subsection.

            (B) __Liability for penalty__ 

            In the case of a failure by—

                (i) a health insurance issuer, the issuer is liable for such penalty, or

                (ii)

                 a group health plan that is a non-Federal governmental plan which is—

                    (I) sponsored by 2 or more employers, the plan is liable for such penalty, or

                    (II) not so sponsored, the employer is liable for such penalty.

            (C) __Amount of penalty__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The maximum amount of penalty imposed under this paragraph is $100 for each day for each individual with respect to which such a failure occurs.

                (ii) __Considerations in imposition__ 

                    In determining the amount of any penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account the previous record of compliance of the entity being assessed with the applicable provisions of this part and the gravity of the violation.

                (iii) __Limitations__ 

                    (I) __Penalty not to apply where failure not discovered exercising reasonable diligence__ 

                        No civil money penalty shall be imposed under this paragraph on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that none of the entities against whom the penalty would be imposed knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed.

                    (II) __Penalty not to apply to failures corrected within 30 days__ 

                        No civil money penalty shall be imposed under this paragraph on any failure if such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, and such failure is corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first day any of the entities against whom the penalty would be imposed knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed.

            (D) __Administrative review__ 

                (i) __Opportunity for hearing__ 

                    The entity assessed shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing by the Secretary upon request made within 30 days after the date of the issuance of a notice of assessment. In such hearing the decision shall be made on the record pursuant to [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554]. If no hearing is requested, the assessment shall constitute a final and unappealable order.

                (ii) __Hearing procedure__ 

                    If a hearing is requested, the initial agency decision shall be made by an administrative law judge, and such decision shall become the final order unless the Secretary modifies or vacates the decision. Notice of intent to modify or vacate the decision of the administrative law judge shall be issued to the parties within 30 days after the date of the decision of the judge. A final order which takes effect under this paragraph shall be subject to review only as provided under subparagraph (E).

            (E) __Judicial review__ 

                (i) __Filing of action for review__ 

                    Any entity against whom an order imposing a civil money penalty has been entered after an agency hearing under this paragraph may obtain review by the United States district court for any district in which such entity is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order, and simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by registered mail to the Secretary.

                (ii) __Certification of administrative record__ 

                    The Secretary shall promptly certify and file in such court the record upon which the penalty was imposed.

                (iii) __Standard for review__ 

                    The findings of the Secretary shall be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence as provided by [section 706(2)(E) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s706/2/E].

                (iv) __Appeal__ 

                    Any final decision, order, or judgment of the district court concerning such review shall be subject to appeal as provided in chapter 83 of title 28.

            (F) __Failure to pay assessment; maintenance of action__ 

                (i) __Failure to pay assessment__

                (ii) __Nonreviewability__ 

                    In such action the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.

            (G) __Payment of penalties__ 

                Except as otherwise provided, penalties collected under this paragraph shall be paid to the Secretary (or other officer) imposing the penalty and shall be available without appropriation and until expended for the purpose of enforcing the provisions with respect to which the penalty was imposed.

            (A) __General rule__

                    The amount of the penalty imposed under this paragraph shall be $100 for each day in the noncompliance period with respect to each participant or beneficiary to whom such failure relates.

                (ii) __Noncompliance period__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “noncompliance period” means, with respect to any failure, the period—

                    (I) beginning on the date such failure first occurs; and

                    (II) ending on the date the failure is corrected.

            (C) __Minimum penalties where failure discovered__ 

            Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D):

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of 1 or more failures with respect to an individual—

                    (I) which are not corrected before the date on which the plan receives a notice from the Secretary of such violation; and

                    (II) which occurred or continued during the period involved;

                 the amount of penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) by reason of such failures with respect to such individual shall not be less than $2,500.

                (ii) __Higher minimum penalty where violations are more than de minimis__ 

                    To the extent violations for which any person is liable under this paragraph for any year are more than de minimis, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting “$15,000” for “$2,500” with respect to such person.

            (D) __Limitations__ 

                (i) __Penalty not to apply where failure not discovered exercising reasonable diligence__ 

                    No penalty shall be imposed by subparagraph (A) on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the person otherwise liable for such penalty did not know, and exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that such failure existed.

                (ii) __Penalty not to apply to failures corrected within certain periods__ 

                No penalty shall be imposed by subparagraph (A) on any failure if—

                    (I) such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect; and

                    (II) such failure is corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first date the person otherwise liable for such penalty knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed.

                (iii) __Overall limitation for unintentional failures__ 

                In the case of failures which are due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) for failures shall not exceed the amount equal to the lesser of—

                    (I) 10 percent of the aggregate amount paid or incurred by the employer (or predecessor employer) during the preceding taxable year for group health plans; or

                    (II) $500,000.

            (E) __Waiver by Secretary__ 

                In the case of a failure which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may waive part or all of the penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) to the extent that the payment of such penalty would be excessive relative to the failure involved.
