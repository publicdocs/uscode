        (2) If the total amount appropriated under [section 300ee–24(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ee–24/a] for a fiscal year equals or exceeds $50,000,000, but is less than $100,000,000, the amount referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be $200,000 for the fiscal year.

        (3) If the total amount appropriated under [section 300ee–24(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ee–24/a] for a fiscal year is less than $50,000,000, the amount referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be $100,000 for the fiscal year.

    (c) __Determination under formula__

            (A) the amount determined under paragraph (2); and

            (B) the amount determined under paragraph (3).

        (2)

         The amount referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is the product of—

            (A) an amount equal to 50 percent of the amounts appropriated pursuant to [section 300ee–24(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ee–24/a]; and

            (B)

             a percentage equal to the quotient of—

                (i) the population of the State involved; divided by

                (ii) the population of the United States.

        (3)

         The amount referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is the product of—

            (B)

             a percentage equal to the quotient of—

                (i) the number of additional cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported to and confirmed by the Secretary for the State involved for the most recent fiscal year for which such data is available; divided by

        (2)

         The amounts referred to in paragraph (1) are any amounts that are not paid to States under [section 300ee–11(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ee–11/a] as a result of—
