## § 287. National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences

    (a) __Purpose__ 

    The purpose of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (in this subpart referred to as the “Center”) is to advance translational sciences, including by—

        (1) coordinating and developing resources that leverage basic research in support of translational science; and

        (2) developing partnerships and working cooperatively to foster synergy in ways that do not create duplication, redundancy, and competition with industry activities.

    (b) __Clinical trial activities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Center may develop and provide infrastructure and resources for all phases of clinical trials research. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Center may support clinical trials only through the end of phase IIA.

        (2) __Exception__ 

        The Center may support clinical trial activities through the end of phase IIB for a treatment for a rare disease or condition (as defined in [section 360bb of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360bb]) so long as—

            (A) the Center gives public notice for a period of at least 120 days of the Center’s intention to support the clinical trial activities in phase IIB;

            (B) no public or private organization provides credible written intent to the Center that the organization has timely plans to further the clinical trial activities or conduct clinical trials of a similar nature beyond phase IIA; and

            (C) the Center ensures that support of the clinical trial activities in phase IIB will not increase the Federal Government’s liability beyond the award value of the Center’s support.

    (c) __Annual report__ 

    The Center shall publish an annual report that, with respect to all research supported by the Center, includes a complete list of—

        (1) the molecules being studied;

        (2) clinical trial activities being conducted;

        (3) the methods and tools in development;

        (4)

         ongoing partnerships, including—

            (A) the rationale for each partnership;

            (B) the status of each partnership;

            (C) the funding provided by the Center to other entities pursuant to each partnership, and

            (D) the activities which have been transferred to industry pursuant to each partnership; and

        (5) known research activity of other entities that is or will expand upon research activity of the Center.
