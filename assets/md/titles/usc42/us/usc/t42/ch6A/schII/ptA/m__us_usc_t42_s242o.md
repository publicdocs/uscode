Each State represented at any conference shall be entitled to a single vote. Whenever at any such conference matters relating to mental health are to be discussed, the mental health authorities of the respective States shall be invited to attend.

    (b) From time to time the Secretary shall issue information related to public health, in the form of publications or otherwise, for the use of the public, and shall publish weekly reports of health conditions in the United States and other countries and other pertinent health information for the use of persons and institutions concerned with health services.
