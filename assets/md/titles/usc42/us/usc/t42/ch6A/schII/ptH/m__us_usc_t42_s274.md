                (i) a national list of individuals who need organs, and

            (F) prepare and distribute, on a regionalized basis (and, to the extent practicable, among regions or on a national basis), samples of blood sera from individuals who are included on the list and whose immune system makes it difficult for them to receive organs, in order to facilitate matching the compatibility of such individuals with organ donors,

            (G) coordinate, as appropriate, the transportation of organs from organ procurement organizations to transplant centers,

            (H) provide information to physicians and other health professionals regarding organ donation,

            (I) collect, analyze, and publish data concerning organ donation and transplants,

            (N) carry out studies and demonstration projects for the purpose of improving procedures for organ donation procurement and allocation, including but not limited to projects to examine and attempt to increase transplantation among populations with special needs, including children and individuals who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups, and among populations with limited access to transportation, and

            (O) provide that for purposes of this paragraph, the term “children” refers to individuals who are under the age of 18.

        (3)  __Clarification__  __.—__ 

        In adopting and using standards of quality under paragraph (2)(E), the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network may adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (in this paragraph referred to as “HIV”), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who—

            (A) are infected with HIV before receiving such organ; and

            (B)

                (i) are participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations described in subsections (a) and (b) of [section 274f–5 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s274f–5]; or

                (ii) if the Secretary has determined under [section 274f–5(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s274f–5/c] that participation in such clinical research, as a requirement for such transplants, is no longer warranted, are receiving a transplant under the standards and regulations under [section 274f–5(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s274f–5/c].

    (c) __Consideration of critical comments__ 

    The Secretary shall establish procedures for—

        (1) receiving from interested persons critical comments relating to the manner in which the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is carrying out the duties of the Network under subsection (b) of this section; and

        (2) the consideration by the Secretary of such critical comments.
