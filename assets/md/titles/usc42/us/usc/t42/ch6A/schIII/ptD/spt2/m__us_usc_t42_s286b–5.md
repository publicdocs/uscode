        (4) the introduction of new technologies in medical librarianship.

    (b)

        (1)

         The amount of any grant under this section to any medical library or related instrumentality shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the scope of library or related services provided by such library or instrumentality in relation to the population and purposes served by it.

        (2) Grants to such medical libraries or related instrumentalities under this section shall be in such amounts as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe with a view to assuring adequate continuing financial support for such libraries or instrumentalities from other sources during and after the period for which grants are provided, except that in no case shall any grant under this section to a medical library or related instrumentality for any fiscal year exceed $1,000,000.
