    (c) __Purpose and use of Ready Reserve__

            (C) be available for backfilling critical positions left vacant during deployment of active duty Commissioned Corps members, as well as for deployment to respond to public health emergencies, both foreign and domestic; and

            (D) be available for service assignment in isolated, hardship, and medically underserved communities (as defined in [section 295p of this title][/us/usc/t42/s295p]) to improve access to health services.

    (d) __Funding__ 

        For the purpose of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the Commissioned Corps under this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for recruitment and training and $12,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for the Ready Reserve Corps.
