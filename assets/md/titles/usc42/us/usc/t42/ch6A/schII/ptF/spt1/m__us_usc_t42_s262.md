    (k) __Licensure of biological products as biosimilar or interchangeable__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any person may submit an application for licensure of a biological product under this subsection.

        (2) __Content__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) __Required information__ 

                An application submitted under this subsection shall include information demonstrating that—

                    (I)

                     the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from—

                        (aa) analytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;

                        (bb) animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and

                        (cc) a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in 1 or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product;

                    (II) the biological product and reference product utilize the same mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism or mechanisms of action are known for the reference product;

                    (III) the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the biological product have been previously approved for the reference product;

                    (IV) the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the biological product are the same as those of the reference product; and

                    (V) the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.

                (ii) __Determination by Secretary__ 

                    The Secretary may determine, in the Secretary’s discretion, that an element described in clause (i)(I) is unnecessary in an application submitted under this subsection.

                (iii) __Additional information__ 

                An application submitted under this subsection—

                    (I) shall include publicly-available information regarding the Secretary’s previous determination that the reference product is safe, pure, and potent; and

                    (II) may include any additional information in support of the application, including publicly-available information with respect to the reference product or another biological product.

            (B) __Interchangeability__ 

                An application (or a supplement to an application) submitted under this subsection may include information demonstrating that the biological product meets the standards described in paragraph (4).

        (3) __Evaluation by Secretary__ 

        Upon review of an application (or a supplement to an application) submitted under this subsection, the Secretary shall license the biological product under this subsection if—

            (A)

             the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or the supplement) is sufficient to show that the biological product—

                (i) is biosimilar to the reference product; or

                (ii) meets the standards described in paragraph (4), and therefore is interchangeable with the reference product; and

            (B) the applicant (or other appropriate person) consents to the inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application, in accordance with subsection (c).

        (4) __Safety standards for determining interchangeability__ 

        Upon review of an application submitted under this subsection or any supplement to such application, the Secretary shall determine the biological product to be interchangeable with the reference product if the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or a supplement to such application) is sufficient to show that—

            (A)

             the biological product—

                (i) is biosimilar to the reference product; and

                (ii) can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and

            (B) for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.

        (5) __General rules__ 

            (A) __One reference product per application__ 

                A biological product, in an application submitted under this subsection, may not be evaluated against more than 1 reference product.

                The authority of the Secretary with respect to risk evaluation and mitigation strategies under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] shall apply to biological products licensed under this subsection in the same manner as such authority applies to biological products licensed under subsection (a).

        (6) __Exclusivity for first interchangeable biological product__ 

        Upon review of an application submitted under this subsection relying on the same reference product for which a prior biological product has received a determination of interchangeability for any condition of use, the Secretary shall not make a determination under paragraph (4) that the second or subsequent biological product is interchangeable for any condition of use until the earlier of—

            (A) 1 year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product to be approved as interchangeable for that reference product;

            (B)

             18 months after—

                (i) a final court decision on all patents in suit in an action instituted under subsection (l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar biological product; or

                (ii) the dismissal with or without prejudice of an action instituted under subsection (l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar biological product; or

            (C)

                (i) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product if the applicant that submitted such application has been sued under subsection (l)(6) and such litigation is still ongoing within such 42-month period; or

                (ii) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product if the applicant that submitted such application has not been sued under subsection (l)(6).

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “final court decision” means a final decision of a court from which no appeal (other than a petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari) has been or can be taken.

        (7) __Exclusivity for reference product__ 

            (A) __Effective date of biosimilar application approval__ 

                Approval of an application under this subsection may not be made effective by the Secretary until the date that is 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under subsection (a).

            (B) __Filing period__ 

                An application under this subsection may not be submitted to the Secretary until the date that is 4 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under subsection (a).

            (C) __First licensure__ 

            Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to a license for or approval of—

                (i) a supplement for the biological product that is the reference product; or

                (ii)

                 a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product that is the reference product (or a licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for—

                    (I) a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength; or

                    (II) a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.

        (8) __Guidance documents__ 

            (A) __In general__
