If a vacancy occurs in the Panel, the President shall make an appointment to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the date the vacancy occurred.

            (C) Members of the Panel shall each be entitled to receive the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule for each day (including traveltime) during which they are engaged in the actual performance of duties as members of the Panel and shall be paid or reimbursed, in accordance with title 5, for their travel to and from their place of service and for other expenses associated with their assignment.

        (3) The Panel shall meet at the call of the chairman, but not less often than four times a year. A transcript shall be kept of the proceedings of each meeting of the Panel, and the chairman shall make such transcript available to the public.

Any delays or blockages in rapid execution of the Program shall immediately be brought to the attention of the President. The Panel shall submit to the President periodic progress reports on the National Cancer Program and shall submit to the President, the Secretary, and the Congress an annual evaluation of the efficacy of the Program and suggestions for improvements, and shall submit such other reports as the President shall direct.
