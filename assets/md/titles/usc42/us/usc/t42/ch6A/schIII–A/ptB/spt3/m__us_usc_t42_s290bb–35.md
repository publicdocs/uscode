            The term “serious emotional disturbance” with respect to a youth offender means an offender who currently, or at any time within the 1-year period ending on the day on which services are sought under this section, has a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that functionally impairs the offender’s life by substantially limiting the offender’s role in family, school, or community activities, and interfering with the offender’s ability to achieve or maintain one or more developmentally-appropriate social, behavior, cognitive, communicative, or adaptive skills.

        (2) __Community-based system of care__ 

            The term “community-based system of care” means the provision of services for the youth offender by various State or local agencies that in an interagency fashion or operating as a network addresses the recreational, social, educational, vocational, mental health, substance abuse, and operational needs of the youth offender.

        (3) __Youth offender__ 

            The term “youth offender” means an individual who is 21 years of age or younger who has been discharged from a State or local juvenile or criminal justice system, except that if the individual is between the ages of 18 and 21 years, such individual has had contact with the State or local juvenile or criminal justice system prior to attaining 18 years of age and is under the jurisdiction of such a system at the time services are sought.

    (f) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003.
