Not more than three political subdivisions may receive awards pursuant to this subparagraph.

            (B) __Coordination with Statewide plans__ 

                An award pursuant to subparagraph (A) may not be made unless the application of the political subdivision involved is in coordination with, and consistent with, applicable Statewide plans described in subsection (b) of this section.

            (C) __Relationship to formula grants__ 

                In the case of a State that will receive an award pursuant to paragraph (3), and in which there is located a political subdivision that will receive an award pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, in determining the amount under paragraph (3)(C) for the State, subtract from the population of the State an amount equal to the population of such political subdivision.

            (D) __Continuity of funding__ 

                In determining whether to make an award pursuant to subparagraph (A) to a political subdivision, the Secretary may consider, as a factor indicating that the award should be made, that the political subdivision received public health funding from the Secretary for fiscal year 2006.

        (5) __Significant unmet needs; degree of risk__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, before making awards pursuant to paragraph (3) for such year, reserve from the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for the year an amount determined necessary by the Secretary to make awards under subsection (a) of this section to eligible entities that—

                (i) have a significant need for funds to build capacity to identify, detect, monitor, and respond to a bioterrorist or other threat to the public health, which need will not be met by awards pursuant to paragraph (3); and

                (ii) face a particularly high degree of risk of such a threat.

            (B) __Recipients of grants__ 

                Awards pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be supplemental awards to States that receive awards pursuant to paragraph (3), or may be awards to eligible entities described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section within such States.

            (C) __Finding with respect to District of Columbia__ 

                The Secretary shall consider the District of Columbia to have a significant unmet need for purposes of subparagraph (A), and to face a particularly high degree of risk for such purposes, on the basis of the concentration of entities of national significance located within the District.

            The Secretary shall, in making awards under this section, ensure that with respect to the cooperative agreement awarded, the entity make available appropriate portions of such award to political subdivisions and local departments of public health through a process involving the consensus, approval or concurrence with such local entities.
