        The Secretary may not make a grant under this part to a State unless the State agrees that, in counseling individuals with respect to HIV/AIDS, the State will ensure that, in the case of emergency response employees, the counseling is provided to such employees under conditions appropriate to the needs of the employees regarding the counseling.

    (e) __Rule of construction regarding counseling without testing__ 

        Agreements made pursuant to this section may not be construed to prohibit any grantee under this part from expending the grant for the purpose of providing counseling services described in this section to an individual who does not undergo testing for HIV/AIDS as a result of the grantee or the individual determining that such testing of the individual is not appropriate.
