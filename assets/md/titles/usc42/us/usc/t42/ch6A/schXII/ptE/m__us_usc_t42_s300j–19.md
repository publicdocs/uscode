## § 300j–19. Algal toxin risk assessment and management

    (a) __Strategic plan__ 

        (1) __Development__ 

        Not later than 90 days after August 7, 2015, the Administrator shall develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. The strategic plan shall include steps and timelines to—

            (A) evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water provided by public water systems contaminated with algal toxins;

            (B) establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins which the Administrator determines may have an adverse effect on human health when present in drinking water provided by public water systems, taking into account likely exposure levels;

            (C)

             summarize—

                (i) the known adverse human health effects of algal toxins included on the list published under subparagraph (B) when present in drinking water provided by public water systems; and

                (ii) factors that cause toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae to proliferate and express toxins;

            (D)

             with respect to algal toxins included on the list published under subparagraph (B), determine whether to—

                (i) publish health advisories pursuant to [section 300g–1(b)(1)(F) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300g–1/b/1/F] for such algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems;

                (ii) establish guidance regarding feasible analytical methods to quantify the presence of algal toxins; and

                (iii) establish guidance regarding the frequency of monitoring necessary to determine if such algal toxins are present in drinking water provided by public water systems;

            (E) recommend feasible treatment options, including procedures, equipment, and source water protection practices, to mitigate any adverse public health effects of algal toxins included on the list published under subparagraph (B); and

            (F) enter into cooperative agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, affected States and public water systems, as identified by the Administrator, for the purpose of managing risks associated with algal toxins included on the list published under subparagraph (B).

        (2) __Updates__ 

            The Administrator shall, as appropriate, update and submit to Congress the strategic plan developed under paragraph (1).

    (b) __Information coordination__ 

    In carrying out this section the Administrator shall—

        (1)

         identify gaps in the Agency’s understanding of algal toxins, including—

            (A) the human health effects of algal toxins included on the list published under subsection (a)(1)(B); and

            (B) methods and means of testing and monitoring for the presence of harmful algal toxins in source water of, or drinking water provided by, public water systems;

        (2)

         as appropriate, consult with—

            (A)

             other Federal agencies that—

                (i) examine or analyze cyanobacteria or algal toxins; or

                (ii) address public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms;

            (B) States;

            (C) operators of public water systems;

            (D) multinational agencies;

            (E) foreign governments;

            (F) research and academic institutions; and

            (G) companies that provide relevant drinking water treatment options; and

        (3)

         assemble and publish information from each Federal agency that has—

            (A) examined or analyzed cyanobacteria or algal toxins; or

            (B) addressed public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms.

    (c) __Use of science__ 

        The Administrator shall carry out this section in accordance with the requirements described in [section 300g–1(b)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300g–1/b/3/A], as applicable.

    (d) __Feasible__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “feasible” has the meaning given such term in [section 300g–1(b)(4)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300g–1/b/4/D].
