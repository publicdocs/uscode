        (2) __Best-practices guidelines__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A condition for the receipt of a grant under paragraph (1) is that the adoption organization involved agree that, in providing training under such paragraph, the organization will follow the guidelines developed under subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Process for development of guidelines__

                The Secretary shall establish and supervise a process described in clause (ii) in which the participants are—

                    (I) an appropriate number and variety of adoption organizations that, as a group, have expertise in all models of adoption practice and that represent all members of the adoption triad (birth mother, infant, and adoptive parent); and

                    (II) affected public health entities.

                (ii) __Description of process__ 

                    The process referred to in clause (i) is a process in which the participants described in such clause collaborate to develop best-practices guidelines on the provision of adoption information and referrals to pregnant women on an equal basis with all other courses of action included in nondirective counseling to pregnant women.

                (iii) __Date certain for development__ 

                    The Secretary shall ensure that the guidelines described in clause (ii) are developed not later than 180 days after October 17, 2000.

                The Secretary may not make any grant under paragraph (1) before the date on which the guidelines under subparagraph (B) are developed.

                (ii) the purposes for which the adoption organization expends the grant may include the development of a training curriculum, consistent with the guidelines developed under paragraph (2)(B); and

                (iii) a condition for the receipt of the grant is that the adoption organization agree that, in providing training for the designated staff of eligible health centers, such organization will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the individuals who provide the training are individuals who are knowledgeable in all elements of the adoption process and are experienced in providing adoption information and referrals in the geographic areas in which the eligible health centers are located, and that the designated staff receive the training in such areas.
