## § 293a. Scholarships for disadvantaged students

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary may make a grant to an eligible entity (as defined in subsection (d)(1) of this section) under this section for the awarding of scholarships by schools to any full-time student who is an eligible individual as defined in subsection (d) of this section. Such scholarships may be expended only for tuition expenses, other reasonable educational expenses, and reasonable living expenses incurred in the attendance of such school.

    (b) __Preference in providing scholarships__ 

        The Secretary may not make a grant to an entity under subsection (a) of this section unless the health professions and nursing schools involved agree that, in providing scholarships pursuant to the grant, the schools will give preference to students for whom the costs of attending the schools would constitute a severe financial hardship and, notwithstanding other provisions of this section, to former recipients of scholarships under sections 293 and 293d(d)(2)(B) of this title (as such sections existed on the day before November 13, 1998).

    (c) __Amount of award__ 

        In awarding grants to eligible entities that are health professions and nursing schools, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible entities based on the proportion of graduating students going into primary care, the proportion of underrepresented minority students, and the proportion of graduates working in medically underserved communities.

            (B) is carrying out a program for recruiting and retaining students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including students who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups.

        (2) __Eligible individual__
