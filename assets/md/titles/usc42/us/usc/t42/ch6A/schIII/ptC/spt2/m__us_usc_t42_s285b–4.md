        (2)

         The centers developed under paragraph (1) shall, in addition to being utilized for research, training, and demonstrations, be utilized for the following prevention programs for cardiovascular, pulmonary, and blood diseases:

            (A) Programs to develop improved methods of detecting individuals with a high risk of developing cardiovascular, pulmonary, and blood diseases.

            (B) Programs to develop improved methods of intervention against those factors which cause individuals to have a high risk of developing such diseases.

            (C) Programs to develop health professions and allied health professions personnel highly skilled in the prevention of such diseases.

            (D) Programs to develop improved methods of providing emergency medical services for persons with such diseases.

            (E) Programs of continuing education for health and allied health professionals in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of such diseases and the maintenance of health to reduce the incidence of such diseases and information programs for the public respecting the prevention and early diagnosis and treatment of such diseases and the maintenance of health.
