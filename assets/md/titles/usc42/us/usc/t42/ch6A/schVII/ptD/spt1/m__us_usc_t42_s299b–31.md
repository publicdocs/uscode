## § 299b–31. Quality measure development

    (a) __Quality measure__ 

        In this subpart, the term “quality measure” means a standard for measuring the performance and improvement of population health or of health plans, providers of services, and other clinicians in the delivery of health care services.

    (b) __Identification of quality measures__ 

        (1) __Identification__ 

        The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, shall identify, not less often than triennially, gaps where no quality measures exist and existing quality measures that need improvement, updating, or expansion, consistent with the national strategy under [section 280j of this title][/us/usc/t42/s280j], to the extent available, for use in Federal health programs. In identifying such gaps and existing quality measures that need improvement, the Secretary shall take into consideration—

            (A) the gaps identified by the entity with a contract under section 1890(a) of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1395aaa(a)][/us/usc/t42/s1395aaa/a]\] and other stakeholders;

            (B) quality measures identified by the pediatric quality measures program under section 1139A of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1320b–9a][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–9a]\]; and

            (C) quality measures identified through the Medicaid Quality Measurement Program under section 1139B of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1320b–9b][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–9b]\].

        (2) __Publication__ 

            The Secretary shall make available to the public on an Internet website a report on any gaps identified under paragraph (1) and the process used to make such identification.

    (c) __Grants or contracts for quality measure development__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award grants, contracts, or intergovernmental agreements to eligible entities for purposes of developing, improving, updating, or expanding quality measures identified under subsection (b).

        (2) __Prioritization in the development of quality measures__ 

        In awarding grants, contracts, or agreements under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to the development of quality measures that allow the assessment of—

            (A) health outcomes and functional status of patients;

            (B) the management and coordination of health care across episodes of care and care transitions for patients across the continuum of providers, health care settings, and health plans;

            (C) the experience, quality, and use of information provided to and used by patients, caregivers, and authorized representatives to inform decisionmaking about treatment options, including the use of shared decisionmaking tools and preference sensitive care (as defined in [section 299b–36 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s299b–36]);

            (D) the meaningful use of health information technology;

            (E) the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, appropriateness, and timeliness of care;

            (F) the efficiency of care;

            (G) the equity of health services and health disparities across health disparity populations (as defined in section 285t  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title) and geographic areas;

            (H) patient experience and satisfaction;

            (I) the use of innovative strategies and methodologies identified under [section 299b–33 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s299b–33]; and

            (J) other areas determined appropriate by the Secretary.

                (ii) the views of other parties who also will use the quality measures (such as patients, consumers, and health care purchasers);

            (C) collaborate with the entity with a contract under section 1890(a) of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1395aaa(a)][/us/usc/t42/s1395aaa/a]\] and other stakeholders, as practicable, and the Secretary so that quality measures developed by the eligible entity will meet the requirements to be considered for endorsement by the entity with a contract under such section 1890(a);

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 285t of this title][/us/usc/t42/s285t], referred to in subsec. (c)(2)(G), was in the original “section 485E”, meaning section 485E of act July 1, 1944, which was renumbered section 464z–3 by [Pub.

The act of July 1, 1944, no longer contains a section 485E.

    March 23, 2010, referred to in subsec. (f)(4)(A), (B), was in the original “the date of enactment of this Act” which was translated as meaning the date of the enactment of [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148] which added and amended this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 931 of act July 1, 1944, was renumbered 941 and is classified to [section 299c of this title][/us/usc/t42/s299c].
