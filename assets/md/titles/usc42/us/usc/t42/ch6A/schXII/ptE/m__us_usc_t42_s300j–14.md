                (ii) obtain financial or technical assistance necessary to facilitate establishment of a partnership, or to develop and implement recommendations of a partnership for the protection of source water to assist in the provision of drinking water that complies with national primary drinking water regulations with respect to contaminants addressed by a petition; and

                (iii) develop recommendations regarding voluntary and incentive-based strategies for the long-term protection of the source water of community water systems.
