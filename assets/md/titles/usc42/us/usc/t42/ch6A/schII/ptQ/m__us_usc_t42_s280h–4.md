## § 280h–4. Grants for the establishment of school-based health centers

    (1) __Program__ 

        The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) shall establish a program to award grants to eligible entities to support the operation of school-based health centers.

    (2) __Eligibility__ 

    To be eligible for a grant under this section, an entity shall—

        (A) be a school-based health center or a sponsoring facility of a school-based health center; and

        (B) submit an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including at a minimum an assurance that funds awarded under the grant shall not be used to provide any service that is not authorized or allowed by Federal, State, or local law.

    (3) __Preference__ 

        In awarding grants under this section, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  the Secretary shall give preference to awarding grants for school-based health centers that serve a large population of children eligible for medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.\] or under a waiver of such plan or children eligible for child health assistance under the State child health plan under title XXI of that Act ([42 U.S.C. 1397aa][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa] et seq.).

    (4) __Limitation on use of funds__ 

        An eligible entity shall use funds provided under a grant awarded under this section only for expenditures for facilities (including the acquisition or improvement of land, or the acquisition, construction, expansion, replacement, or other improvement of any building or other facility), equipment, or similar expenditures, as specified by the Secretary. No funds provided under a grant awarded under this section 1 shall be used for expenditures for personnel or to provide health services.

    (5) __Appropriations__ 

        Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2013, $50,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out this section. Funds appropriated under this paragraph shall remain available until expended.

    (6) __Definitions__ 

        In this section, the terms “school-based health center” and “sponsoring facility” have the meanings given those terms in section 2110(c)(9) of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1397jj(c)(9)][/us/usc/t42/s1397jj/c/9]).
