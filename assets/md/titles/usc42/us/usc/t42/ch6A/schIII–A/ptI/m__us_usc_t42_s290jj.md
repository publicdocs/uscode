            (B) the restraints or seclusion are imposed only by an individual trained and certified, by a State-recognized body (as defined in regulation promulgated by the Secretary) and pursuant to a process determined appropriate by the State and approved by the Secretary, in the prevention and use of physical restraint and seclusion, including the needs and behaviors of the population served, relationship building, alternatives to restraint and seclusion, de-escalation methods, avoiding power struggles, thresholds for restraints and seclusion, the physiological and psychological impact of restraint and seclusion, monitoring physical signs of distress and obtaining medical assistance, legal issues, position asphyxia, escape and evasion techniques, time limits, the process for obtaining approval for continued restraints, procedures to address problematic restraints, documentation, processing with children, and follow-up with staff, and investigation of injuries and complaints.

        (2) __Interim procedures relating to training and certification__

            (B) __Requirements__ 

            A procedure developed under subparagraph (A) shall—

                (i) ensure that a supervisory or senior staff person with training in restraint and seclusion who is competent to conduct a face-to-face assessment (as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary), will assess the mental and physical well-being of the child or youth being restrained or secluded and assure that the restraint or seclusion is being done in a safe manner;

        (3) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The use of a drug or medication that is used as a restraint to control behavior or restrict the resident’s freedom of movement that is not a standard treatment for the resident’s medical or psychiatric condition in nonmedical community-based facilities for children and youth described in subsection (a)(1) of this section is prohibited.

            (B) __Prohibition__

        (1) __Mechanical restraint__ 

            The term “mechanical restraint” means the use of devices as a means of restricting a resident’s freedom of movement.

        (2) __Physical escort__ 

            The term “physical escort” means the temporary touching or holding of the hand, wrist, arm, shoulder or back for the purpose of inducing a resident who is acting out to walk to a safe location.

        (3) __Physical restraint__ 

            The term “physical restraint” means a personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of an individual to move his or her arms, legs, or head freely. Such term does not include a physical escort.

        (4) __Seclusion__ 

            The term “seclusion” means a behavior control technique involving locked isolation. Such term does not include a time out.

        (5) __Time out__
