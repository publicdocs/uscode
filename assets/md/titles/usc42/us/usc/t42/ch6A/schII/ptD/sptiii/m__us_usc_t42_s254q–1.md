    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Authority for grants__ 

            The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, may make grants to States for the purpose of assisting the States in operating programs described in paragraph (2) in order to provide for the increased availability of primary health care services in health professional shortage areas. The National Advisory Council established under [section 254j of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254j] shall advise the Administrator regarding the program under this section.

        (2) __Loan repayment programs__ 

            The programs referred to in paragraph (1) are, subject to subsection (c) of this section, programs of entering into contracts under which the State involved agrees to pay all or part of the principal, interest, and related expenses of the educational loans of health professionals in consideration of the professionals agreeing to provide primary health services in health professional shortage areas.

        (3) __Direct administration by State agency__ 

            The Secretary may not make a grant under paragraph (1) unless the State involved agrees that the program operated with the grant will be administered directly by a State agency.

    (b) __Requirement of matching funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State agrees that, with respect to the costs of making payments on behalf of individuals under contracts made pursuant to paragraph (2) of such subsection, the State will make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions in cash toward such costs in an amount equal to not less than $1 for each $1 of Federal funds provided in the grant.

        (2) __Determination of amount of non-Federal contribution__ 

            In determining the amount of non-Federal contributions in cash that a State has provided pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary may not include any amounts provided to the State by the Federal Government.

    (c) __Coordination with Federal program__ 

        (1) __Assignments for health professional shortage areas under Federal program__ 

            The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State involved agrees that, in carrying out the program operated with the grant, the State will assign health professionals participating in the program only to public and nonprofit private entities located in and providing health services in health professional shortage areas.

        (2) __Remedies for breach of contracts__ 

            The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State involved agrees that the contracts provided by the State pursuant to paragraph (2) of such subsection will provide remedies for any breach of the contracts by the health professionals involved.

        (3) __Limitation regarding contract inducements__ 

            (A)

             Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State involved agrees that the contracts provided by the State pursuant to paragraph (2) of such subsection will not be provided on terms that are more favorable to health professionals than the most favorable terms that the Secretary is authorized to provide for contracts under the Loan Repayment Program under section 254l–1 of this title, including terms regarding—

                (i) the annual amount of payments provided on behalf of the professionals regarding educational loans; and

                (ii) the availability of remedies for any breach of the contracts by the health professionals involved.

            (B)

             With respect to the limitation established in subparagraph (A) regarding the annual amount of payments that may be provided to a health professional under a contract provided by a State pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, such limitation shall not apply with respect to a contract if—

                (i) the excess of such annual payments above the maximum amount authorized in section 254l–1(g)(2)(A) of this title for annual payments regarding contracts is paid solely from non-Federal contributions under subsection (b) of this section; and

                (ii) the contract provides that the health professional involved will satisfy the requirement of obligated service under the contract solely through the provision of primary health services in a health professional shortage area that is receiving priority for purposes of [section 254f–1(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254f–1/a/1] and that is authorized to receive assignments under [section 254f of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254f] of individuals who are participating in the Scholarship Program under section 254l of this title.

    (d) __Restrictions on use of funds__

        (1)

         to conduct activities for which Federal funds are expended—

            (A) within the State to provide technical or other nonfinancial assistance under subsection (f) of section 254c  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title;

            (B) under a memorandum of agreement entered into with the State under subsection (h) of such section; or

            (C) under a grant under [section 254r of this title][/us/usc/t42/s254r]; or

        (2) for any purpose other than making payments on behalf of health professionals under contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.

    (e) __Reports__ 

    The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State involved agrees—

        (1) to submit to the Secretary such reports regarding the States loan repayment program, as are determined to be appropriate by the Secretary; and

        (2) to submit such a report not later than January 10 of each fiscal year immediately following any fiscal year for which the State has received such a grant.

    (f) __Requirement of application__ 

        The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless an application for the grant is submitted to the Secretary and the application is in such form, is made in such manner, and contains such agreements, assurances, and information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out such subsection.

    (g) __Noncompliance__ 

        (1) __In general__

        (2) __Reduction in grant relative to number of breached contracts__ 

            (A) Before making a grant under subsection (a) of this section to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of contracts provided by the State under paragraph (2) of such subsection with respect to which there has been an initial breach by the health professionals involved during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying to receive the grant.

            (B) Subject to paragraph (3), in the case of a State with 1 or more initial breaches for purposes of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce the amount of a grant under subsection (a) of this section to the State for the fiscal year involved by an amount equal to the sum of the expenditures of Federal funds made regarding the contracts involved and an amount representing interest on the amount of such expenditures, determined with respect to each contract on the basis of the maximum legal rate prevailing for loans made during the time amounts were paid under the contract, as determined by the Treasurer of the United States.

        (3) __Waiver regarding reduction in grant__ 

            The Secretary may waive the requirement established in paragraph (2)(B) with respect to the initial breach of a contract if the Secretary determines that such breach by the health professional involved was attributable solely to the professional having a serious illness.
