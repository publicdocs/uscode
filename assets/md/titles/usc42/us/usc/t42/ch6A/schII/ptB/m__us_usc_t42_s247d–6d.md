## § 247d–6d. Targeted liability protections for pandemic and epidemic products and security countermeasures

    (a) __Liability protections__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to the other provisions of this section, a covered person shall be immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure if a declaration under subsection (b) of this section has been issued with respect to such countermeasure.

        (2) __Scope of claims for loss__ 

            (A) __Loss__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “loss” means any type of loss, including—

                (i) death;

                (ii) physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition;

                (iii) fear of physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition, including any need for medical monitoring; and

                (iv) loss of or damage to property, including business interruption loss.

                Each of clauses (i) through (iv) applies without regard to the date of the occurrence, presentation, or discovery of the loss described in the clause.

            (B) __Scope__ 

                The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss that has a causal relationship with the administration to or use by an individual of a covered countermeasure, including a causal relationship with the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, or use of such countermeasure.

        (3) __Certain conditions__ 

        Subject to the other provisions of this section, immunity under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure applies only if—

            (A) the countermeasure was administered or used during the effective period of the declaration that was issued under subsection (b) of this section with respect to the countermeasure;

            (B) the countermeasure was administered or used for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health specified in the declaration; and

            (C)

             in addition, in the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure, the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual who—

                (i) was in a population specified by the declaration; and

                (ii) was at the time of administration physically present in a geographic area specified by the declaration or had a connection to such area specified in the declaration.

        (4) __Applicability of certain conditions__ 

        With respect to immunity under paragraph (1) and subject to the other provisions of this section:

            (A) In the case of a covered person who is a manufacturer or distributor of the covered countermeasure involved, the immunity applies without regard to whether such countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).

            (B) In the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, the scope of immunity includes circumstances in which the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in circumstances in which the covered person reasonably could have believed that the countermeasure was administered or used in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).

        (5) __Effect of distribution method__ 

            The provisions of this section apply to a covered countermeasure regardless of whether such countermeasure is obtained by donation, commercial sale, or any other means of distribution, except to the extent that, under paragraph (2)(E) of subsection (b) of this section, the declaration under such subsection provides that subsection (a) of this section applies only to covered countermeasures obtained through a particular means of distribution.

        (6) __Rebuttable presumption__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any administration or use, during the effective period of the emergency declaration by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section, of a covered countermeasure shall have been for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health with respect to which such declaration was issued.

    (b) __Declaration by Secretary__ 

        (1) __Authority to issue declaration__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary makes a determination that a disease or other health condition or other threat to health constitutes a public health emergency, or that there is a credible risk that the disease, condition, or threat may in the future constitute such an emergency, the Secretary may make a declaration, through publication in the Federal Register, recommending, under conditions as the Secretary may specify, the manufacture, testing, development, distribution, administration, or use of one or more covered countermeasures, and stating that subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the activities so recommended.

        (2) __Contents__ 

        In issuing a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify, for each covered countermeasure specified in the declaration—

            (A) the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health for which the Secretary recommends the administration or use of the countermeasure;

            (B) the period or periods during which, including as modified by paragraph (3), subsection (a) of this section is in effect, which period or periods may be designated by dates, or by milestones or other description of events, including factors specified in paragraph (6);

            (C) the population or populations of individuals for which subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that such subsection applies without geographic limitation to all individuals);

            (D) the geographic area or areas for which subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that such subsection applies without geographic limitation), including, with respect to individuals in the populations identified under subparagraph (C), a specification, as determined appropriate by the Secretary, of whether the declaration applies only to individuals physically present in such areas or whether in addition the declaration applies to individuals who have a connection to such areas, which connection is described in the declaration; and

            (E) whether subsection (a) of this section is effective only to a particular means of distribution as provided in subsection (a)(5) of this section for obtaining the countermeasure, and if so, the particular means to which such subsection is effective.

        (3) __Effective period of declaration__ 

            (A) __Flexibility of period__ 

                The Secretary may, in describing periods under paragraph (2)(B), have different periods for different covered persons to address different logistical, practical or other differences in responsibilities.

            (B) __Additional time to be specified__ 

            In each declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary, after consulting, to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, with the manufacturer of the covered countermeasure, shall also specify a date that is after the ending date specified under paragraph (2)(B) and that allows what the Secretary determines is—

                (i) a reasonable period for the manufacturer to arrange for disposition of the covered countermeasure, including the return of such product to the manufacturer; and

                (ii) a reasonable period for covered persons to take such other actions as may be appropriate to limit administration or use of the covered countermeasure.

            (C) __Additional period for certain strategic national stockpile countermeasures__ 

                With respect to a covered countermeasure that is in the stockpile under [section 247d–6b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6b], if such countermeasure was the subject of a declaration under paragraph (1) at the time that it was obtained for the stockpile, the effective period of such declaration shall include a period when the countermeasure is administered or used pursuant to a distribution or release from the stockpile.

        (4) __Amendments to declaration__ 

            The Secretary may through publication in the Federal Register amend any portion of a declaration under paragraph (1). Such an amendment shall not retroactively limit the applicability of subsection (a) of this section with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure involved.

        (5) __Certain disclosures__ 

            In publishing a declaration under paragraph (1) in the Federal Register, the Secretary is not required to disclose any matter described in [section 552(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b].

        (6) __Factors to be considered__ 

            In deciding whether and under what circumstances or conditions to issue a declaration under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure, the Secretary shall consider the desirability of encouraging the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, and use of such countermeasure.

        (7) __Judicial review__ 

            No court of the United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary under this subsection.

        (8) __Preemption of State law__ 

        During the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b) of this section, or at any time with respect to conduct undertaken in accordance with such declaration, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish, enforce, or continue in effect with respect to a covered countermeasure any provision of law or legal requirement that—

            (A) is different from, or is in conflict with, any requirement applicable under this section; and

            (B) relates to the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, formulation, manufacture, distribution, sale, donation, purchase, marketing, promotion, packaging, labeling, licensing, use, any other aspect of safety or efficacy, or the prescribing, dispensing, or administration by qualified persons of the covered countermeasure, or to any matter included in a requirement applicable to the covered countermeasure under this section or any other provision of this chapter, or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\].

        (9) __Report to Congress__ 

            Within 30 days after making a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report that provides an explanation of the reasons for issuing the declaration and the reasons underlying the determinations of the Secretary with respect to paragraph (2). Within 30 days after making an amendment under paragraph (4), the Secretary shall submit to such committees a report that provides the reasons underlying the determination of the Secretary to make the amendment.

    (c) __Definition of willful misconduct__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as the meaning of such term is further restricted pursuant to paragraph (2), the term “willful misconduct” shall, for purposes of subsection (d) of this section, denote an act or omission that is taken—

                (i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose;

                (ii) knowingly without legal or factual justification; and

                (iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit.

            (B) __Rule of construction__ 

                The criterion stated in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as establishing a standard for liability that is more stringent than a standard of negligence in any form or recklessness.

        (2) __Authority to promulgate regulatory definition__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations, which may be promulgated through interim final rules, that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered person that may qualify as “willful misconduct” for purposes of subsection (d) of this section.

            (B) __Factors to be considered__ 

                In promulgating the regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall consider the need to define the scope of permissible civil actions under subsection (d) of this section in a way that will not adversely affect the public health.

            (C) __Temporal scope of regulations__ 

                The regulations under this paragraph may specify the temporal effect that they shall be given for purposes of subsection (d) of this section.

            (D) __Initial rulemaking__ 

                Within 180 days after December 30, 2005, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall commence and complete an initial rulemaking process under this paragraph.

        (3) __Proof of willful misconduct__ 

            In an action under subsection (d) of this section, the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence willful misconduct by each covered person sued and that such willful misconduct caused death or serious physical injury.

        (4) __Defense for acts or omissions taken pursuant to Secretary’s declaration__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a program planner or qualified person shall not have engaged in “willful misconduct” as a matter of law where such program planner or qualified person acted consistent with applicable directions, guidelines, or recommendations by the Secretary regarding the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is specified in the declaration under subsection (b) of this section, provided either the Secretary, or a State or local health authority, was provided with notice of information regarding serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is material to the plaintiff’s alleged loss within 7 days of the actual discovery of such information by such program planner or qualified person.

        (5) __Exclusion for regulated activity of manufacturer or distributor__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If an act or omission by a manufacturer or distributor with respect to a covered countermeasure, which act or omission is alleged under subsection (e)(3)(A) of this section to constitute willful misconduct, is subject to regulation by this chapter or by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\], such act or omission shall not constitute “willful misconduct” for purposes of subsection (d) of this section if—

                (i) neither the Secretary nor the Attorney General has initiated an enforcement action with respect to such act or omission; or

                (ii) such an enforcement action has been initiated and the action has been terminated or finally resolved without a covered remedy.

        In an action under subsection (d) of this section, the complaint shall plead with particularity each element of the plaintiff’s claim, including—

            (A) each act or omission, by each covered person sued, that is alleged to constitute willful misconduct relating to the covered countermeasure administered to or used by the person on whose behalf the complaint was filed;

            (B) facts supporting the allegation that such alleged willful misconduct proximately caused the injury claimed; and

                (ii) certified medical records documenting such injury or death and such proximate causal connection.

        (5) __Three-judge court__ 

            Any action under subsection (d) of this section shall be assigned initially to a panel of three judges. Such panel shall have jurisdiction over such action for purposes of considering motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and matters related thereto. If such panel has denied such motions, or if the time for filing such motions has expired, such panel shall refer the action to the chief judge for assignment for further proceedings, including any trial. [Section 1253 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1253] and paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of [section 2284 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2284] shall not apply to actions under subsection (d) of this section.

        (6) __Civil discovery__ 

            (A) __Timing__

                (ii) in the event such a motion is filed, before the court has ruled on such motion; and

            (B) __Standard__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court in an action under subsection (d) of this section shall permit discovery only with respect to matters directly related to material issues contested in such action, and the court shall compel a response to a discovery request (including a request for admission, an interrogatory, a request for production of documents, or any other form of discovery request) under Rule 37, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, only if the court finds that the requesting party needs the information sought to prove or defend as to a material issue contested in such action and that the likely benefits of a response to such request equal or exceed the burden or cost for the responding party of providing such response.

        (7) __Reduction in award of damages for collateral source benefits__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In an action under subsection (d) of this section, the amount of an award of damages that would otherwise be made to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits to such plaintiff.

            (B) __Provider of collateral source benefits not to have lien or subrogation__ 

                No provider of collateral source benefits shall recover any amount against the plaintiff or receive any lien or credit against the plaintiff’s recovery or be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the plaintiff in an action under subsection (d) of this section.

            (C) __Collateral source benefit defined__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “collateral source benefit” means any amount paid or to be paid in the future to or on behalf of the plaintiff, or any service, product, or other benefit provided or to be provided in the future to or on behalf of the plaintiff, as a result of the injury or wrongful death, pursuant to—

Such sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, and to compensate the party or parties injured by such conduct.

        (10) __Interlocutory appeal__ 

            The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have jurisdiction of an interlocutory appeal by a covered person taken within 30 days of an order denying a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment based on an assertion of the immunity from suit conferred by subsection (a) of this section or based on an assertion of the exclusion under subsection (c)(5) of this section.

    (f) __Actions by and against the United States__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate or limit any right, remedy, or authority that the United States or any agency thereof may possess under any other provision of law or to waive sovereign immunity or to abrogate or limit any defense or protection available to the United States or its agencies, instrumentalities, officers, or employees under any other law, including any provision of chapter 171 of title 28 (relating to tort claims procedure).
