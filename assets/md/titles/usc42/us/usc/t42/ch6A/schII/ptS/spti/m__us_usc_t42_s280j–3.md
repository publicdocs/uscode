    (a) __Establishment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 2 years after March 23, 2010, the Secretary shall make available a program for eligible hospitals to improve their readmission rates through the use of patient safety organizations (as defined in [section 299b–21(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s299b–21/4]).

        (2) __Eligible hospital defined__

        (3) __Risk adjustment__ 

            The Secretary shall utilize appropriate risk adjustment measures to determine eligible hospitals.

    (b) __Report to the Secretary__ 

        As determined appropriate by the Secretary, eligible hospitals and patient safety organizations working with those hospitals shall report to the Secretary on the processes employed by the hospital to improve readmission rates and the impact of such processes on readmission rates.
