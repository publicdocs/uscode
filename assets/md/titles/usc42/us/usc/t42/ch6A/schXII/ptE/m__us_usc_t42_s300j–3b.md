## § 300j–3b. Contaminant standards or treatment technique guidelines

    (1) Not later than nine months after October 18, 1978, the Administrator shall promulgate guidelines establishing supplemental standards or treatment technique requirements for microbiological, viral, radiological, organic, and inorganic contaminants, which guidelines shall be conditions, as provided in paragraph (2), of any grant for a demonstration project for water reclamation, recycling, and reuse funded under [section 300j–3a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300j–3a] or under [section 300j–3(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300j–3/a/2], where such project involves direct human consumption of treated wastewater. Such guidelines shall provide for sufficient control of each such contaminant, such that in the Administrator’s judgement, no adverse effects on the health of persons may reasonably be anticipated to occur, allowing an adequate margin of safety.

    (2)

     A grant referred to in paragraph (1) for a project which involves direct human consumption of treated wastewater may be awarded on or after the date of promulgation of guidelines under this section only if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the project—

        (A) will comply with all national primary drinking water regulations under [section 300g–1 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300g–1];

        (B) will comply with all guidelines under this section; and

        (C) will in other respects provide safe drinking water.

        Any such grant awarded before the date of promulgation of such guidelines shall be conditioned on the applicant’s agreement to comply to the maximum feasible extent with such guidelines as expeditiously as practicable following the date of promulgation thereof.

    (3)

     Guidelines under this section may, in the discretion of the Administrator—

        (A) be nationally and uniformly applicable to all projects funded under [section 300j–3a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300j–3a] or section 300j–1(a)(2)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title;

        (B) vary for different classes or categories of such projects (as determined by the Administrator);

        (C) be established and applicable on a proj­ect-by-project basis; or

        (D) any combination of the above.

    (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or delay the award of any grant referred to in paragraph (1) prior to the date of promulgation of such guidelines.
