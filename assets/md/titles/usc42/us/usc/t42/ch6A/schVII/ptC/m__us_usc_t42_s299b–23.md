## § 299b–23. Network of patient safety databases

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall facilitate the creation of, and maintain, a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource for providers, patient safety organizations, and other entities. The network of databases shall have the capacity to accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze nonidentifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations, providers, or other entities. The Secretary shall assess the feasibility of providing for a single point of access to the network for qualified researchers for information aggregated across the network and, if feasible, provide for implementation.

    (b) __Data standards__ 

        The Secretary may determine common formats for the reporting to and among the network of patient safety databases maintained under subsection (a) of this section of nonidentifiable patient safety work product, including necessary work product elements, common and consistent definitions, and a standardized computer interface for the processing of such work product. To the extent practicable, such standards shall be consistent with the administrative simplification provisions of part C of title XI of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1320d][/us/usc/t42/s1320d] et seq.\].

    (c) __Use of information__ 

        Information reported to and among the network of patient safety databases under subsection (a) of this section shall be used to analyze national and regional statistics, including trends and patterns of health care errors. The information resulting from such analyses shall be made available to the public and included in the annual quality reports prepared under [section 299b–2(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s299b–2/b/2].
