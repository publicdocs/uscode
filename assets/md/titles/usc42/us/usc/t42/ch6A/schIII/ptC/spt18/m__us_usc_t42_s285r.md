         Activities under the Program shall include the following with respect to biomedical imaging and bioengineering:

            (A) Research into the development of new techniques and devices.

            (B) Related research in physics, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines.

            (C) Technology assessments and outcomes studies to evaluate the effectiveness of biologics, materials, processes, devices, procedures, and informatics.

            (D) Research in screening for diseases and disorders.

            (E) The advancement of existing imaging and bioengineering modalities, including imaging, biomaterials, and informatics.

            (F) The development of target-specific agents to enhance images and to identify and delineate disease.

L. 109–482, title I, § 103(b)(37)][/us/pl/109/482/s103/b/37], Jan. 15, 2007, [120 Stat. 3688][/us/stat/120/3688].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2007—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 109–482][/us/pl/109/482] struck out subsec. (d) which related to appropriations for fiscal years 2001 to 2003.

 __Effective Date of 2007 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 109–482][/us/pl/109/482] applicable only with respect to amounts appropriated for fiscal year 2007 or subsequent fiscal years, see [section 109 of Pub. L. 109–482][/us/pl/109/482/s109], set out as a note under [section 281 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s281].

 __Effective Date__ 

[Pub. L. 106–580, § 4][/us/pl/106/580/s4], Dec. 29, 2000, [114 Stat. 3092][/us/stat/114/3092], provided that: 

> “This Act \[enacting this subpart, amending [section 281 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s281], and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and [section 201 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s201]\] takes effect October 1, 2000, or upon the date of the enactment of this Act \[Dec. 29, 2000\], whichever occurs later.”

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 106–580, § 2][/us/pl/106/580/s2], Dec. 29, 2000, [114 Stat. 3088][/us/stat/114/3088], provided that: 

> “The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) Basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, informatics, and related fields is critical to improving health care but is fundamentally different from the research in molecular biology on which the current national research institutes at the National Institutes of Health (‘NIH’) are based. To ensure the development of new techniques and technologies for the 21st century, these disciplines therefore require an identity and research home at the NIH that is independent of the existing institute structure.

>     “(2) Advances based on medical research promise new, more effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases, but the development of new, noninvasive imaging techniques for earlier detection and diagnosis of disease is essential to take full advantage of such new treatments and to promote the general improvement of health care.

>     “(3) The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is necessary to continue the current rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology.

>     “(4) Advances in telemedicine, and teleradiology in particular, are increasingly important in the delivery of high quality, reliable medical care to rural citizens and other underserved populations. To fulfill the promise of telemedicine and related technologies fully, a structure is needed at the NIH to support basic research focused on the acquisition, transmission, processing, and optimal display of images.

>     “(5) A number of Federal departments and agencies support imaging and engineering research with potential medical applications, but a central coordinating body, preferably housed at the NIH, is needed to coordinate these disparate efforts and facilitate the transfer of technologies with medical applications.

>     “(6) Several breakthrough imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (‘MRI’) and computed tomography (‘CT’), have been developed primarily abroad, in large part because of the absence of a home at the NIH for basic research in imaging and related fields. The establishment of a central focus for imaging and bioengineering research at the NIH would promote both scientific advance and United States economic development.

>     “(7) At a time when a consensus exists to add significant resources to the NIH in coming years, it is appropriate to modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure that research dollars are expended more effectively and efficiently and that the fields of medical science that have contributed the most to the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease in recent years receive appropriate emphasis.

>     “(8) The establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH would accelerate the development of new technologies with clinical and research applications, improve coordination and efficiency at the NIH and throughout the Federal Government, reduce duplication and waste, lay the foundation for a new medical information age, promote economic development, and provide a structure to train the young researchers who will make the pathbreaking discoveries of the next century.”

 __Establishment of Institute and Advisory Council__ 

[Pub. L. 106–580, § 3(b)][/us/pl/106/580/s3/b]–(d), Dec. 29, 2000, [114 Stat. 3091][/us/stat/114/3091], provided that:

>     “(b) __Use of Existing Resources.—__ 

>     In providing for the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering pursuant to the amendment made by subsection (a) \[enacting this subpart\], the Director of the National Institutes of Health (referred to in this subsection as ‘NIH’)—

>         “(1) may transfer to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering such personnel of NIH as the Director determines to be appropriate;

>         “(2) may, for quarters for such Institute, utilize such facilities of NIH as the Director determines to be appropriate; and

>         “(3) may obtain administrative support for the Institute from the other agencies of NIH, including the other national research institutes.

>     “(c) __Construction of Facilities.—__ 

>     None of the provisions of this Act \[enacting this subpart, amending [section 281 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s281], and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and [section 201 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s201]\] or the amendments made by the Act may be construed as authorizing the construction of facilities, or the acquisition of land, for purposes of the establishment or operation of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

>     “(d) __Date Certain for Establishment of Advisory Council.—__ 

>     Not later than 90 days after the effective date of this Act \[Dec. 29, 2000\] under section 4 \[set out above\], the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall complete the establishment of an advisory council for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering in accordance with section 406 of the Public Health Service Act \[[42 U.S.C. 284a][/us/usc/t42/s284a]\] and in accordance with section 464z of such Act (as added by subsection (a) of this section) \[[42 U.S.C. 285r][/us/usc/t42/s285r]\].”
