    (a) __Availability of services regardless of ability to pay or payment source__ 

    An entity to which a Corps member is assigned shall not deny requested health care services, and shall not discriminate in the provision of services to an individual—

        (1) because the individual is unable to pay for the services; or

        (2)

         because payment for the services would be made under—

            (B) the medicaid program under title XIX of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.); or

            (C) the State children’s health insurance program under title XXI of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 1397aa][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa] et seq.).

    (b) __Charges for services__ 

    The following rules shall apply to charges for health care services provided by an entity to which a Corps member is assigned:

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Schedule of fees or payments__ 

                Except as provided in paragraph (2), the entity shall prepare a schedule of fees or payments for the entity’s services, consistent with locally prevailing rates or charges and designed to cover the entity’s reasonable cost of operation.

            (B) __Schedule of discounts__ 

                Except as provided in paragraph (2), the entity shall prepare a corresponding schedule of discounts (including, in appropriate cases, waivers) to be applied to the payment of such fees or payments. In preparing the schedule, the entity shall adjust the discounts on the basis of a patient’s ability to pay.

            (C) __Use of schedules__ 

                The entity shall make every reasonable effort to secure from patients fees and payments for services in accordance with such schedules, and fees or payments shall be sufficiently discounted in accordance with the schedule described in subparagraph (B).

        (2) __Services to beneficiaries of Federal and federally assisted programs__ 

        In the case of health care services furnished to an individual who is a beneficiary of a program listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the entity—

            (A) shall accept an assignment pursuant to section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii)][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3/B/ii]) with respect to an individual who is a beneficiary under the medicare program; and

            (B)

             shall enter into an appropriate agreement with—

                (i) the State agency administering the program under title XIX of such Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.\] with respect to an individual who is a beneficiary under the medicaid program; and

                (ii) the State agency administering the program under title XXI of such Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1397aa][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa] et seq.\] with respect to an individual who is a beneficiary under the State children’s health insurance program.

        (3) __Collection of payments__ 

            The entity shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to collect all payments due for health care services provided by the entity, including payments from any third party (including a Federal, State, or local government agency and any other third party) that is responsible for part or all of the charge for such services.
