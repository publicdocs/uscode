    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) may make grants to nonprofit organizations composed of, or representing, health care providers to assist in the payment of the costs of projects to train such providers concerning—

        (2) the provision of care and treatment to individuals with such syndrome or related illnesses.

    (b) __Limitation__ 

        The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section to an entity only if the entity will provide services under the grant in a geographic area, or to a population of individuals, not served by a program substantially similar to the program described in subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Requirement of matching funds__ 

        (1) The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the applicant for the grant agrees, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the applicant in carrying out the purpose described in such subsection, to make available, directly or through donations from public or private entities, non-Federal contributions (in cash or in kind under paragraph (2)) toward such costs in an amount equal to not less than $2 for each $1 of Federal funds provided in such payments.

        (2) Non-Federal contributions required in paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.

        (1) an application for the grant is submitted to the Secretary;

        (2) with respect to carrying out the purpose for which the grant is to be made, the application provides assurances of compliance satisfactory to the Secretary; and

        (3) the application otherwise is in such form, is made in such manner, and contains such agreements, assurances, and information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out this section.
