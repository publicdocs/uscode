## § 292y. General provisions

    (a) __Date certain for applications__ 

        The Secretary shall from time to time set dates by which schools must file applications for Federal capital contributions.

    (b) __Contingent reduction in allotments__ 

        If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year in such applications exceeds the amounts appropriated under this section for that fiscal year, the allotment to the loan fund of each such school shall be reduced to whichever of the following is the smaller: (A) the amount requested in its application; or (B) an amount which bears the same ratio to the amounts appropriated as the number of students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in such school during such fiscal year bears to the estimated total number of students in all such schools during such year. Amounts remaining after allotment under the preceding sentence shall be reallotted in accordance with clause (B) of such sentence among schools whose applications requested more than the amounts so allotted to their loan funds, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the total allotted to any such school’s loan fund from exceeding the total so requested by it.

    (c) __Allotment of excess funds__ 

        Funds available in any fiscal year for payment to schools under this subpart which are in excess of the amount appropriated pursuant to this section for that year shall be allotted among schools in such manner as the Secretary determines will best carry out the purposes of this subpart.

    (d) __Payment of installments to schools__ 

        Allotments to a loan fund of a school shall be paid to it from time to time in such installments as the Secretary determines will not result in unnecessary accumulations in the loan fund at such school.

    (e) __Disposition of funds returned to Secretary__ 

        (1) __Expenditure for Federal capital contributions__ 

            Subject to [section 292s(b)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292s/b/5], any amounts from student loan funds under [section 292q of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292q] that are returned to the Secretary by health professions schools shall be expended to make Federal capital contributions to such funds.

        (2) __Date certain for contributions__ 

            Amounts described in paragraph (1) that are returned to the Secretary shall be obligated before the end of the succeeding fiscal year.

        (3) __Preference in making contributions__ 

            In making Federal capital contributions to student loans funds under [section 292q of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292q] for a fiscal year from amounts described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to health professions schools of the same disciplines as the health professions schools returning such amounts for the period during which the amounts expended for such contributions were received by the Secretary. Any such amounts that, prior to being so returned, were available only for the purpose of loans under this subpart to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds shall be available only for such purpose.

    (f) __Funding for certain medical schools__ 

        (1) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

            For the purpose of making Federal capital contributions to student loan funds established under [section 292q of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292q] by schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, there is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1994 through 1996.

        (2) __Minimum requirements__ 

            (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may make a Federal capital contribution pursuant to paragraph (1) only if the school of medicine or osteopathic medicine involved meets the conditions described in subparagraph (A) of [section 292s(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292s/b/2] or the conditions described in subparagraph (C) of such section.

            (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conditions referred to in such subparagraph shall be applied with respect to graduates of the school involved whose date of graduation occurred approximately 3 years before June 30 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the Federal capital contribution involved is made.
