## § 300gg–11. No lifetime or annual limits

    (a) __Prohibition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish—

            (A) lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary; or

            (B) except as provided in paragraph (2), annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.

        (2) __Annual limits prior to 2014__ 

            With respect to plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may only establish a restricted annual limit on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary with respect to the scope of benefits that are essential health benefits under [section 18022(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18022/b], as determined by the Secretary. In defining the term “restricted annual limit” for purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall ensure that access to needed services is made available with a minimal impact on premiums.

    (b) __Per beneficiary limits__ 

        Subsection (a) shall not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under [section 18022(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18022/b], to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law.

Such report shall include such recommendations as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

>         “(3) __GAO report on large employer access to health insurance coverage.—__ 

>         The Comptroller General shall provide for a study of the extent to which classes of large employers in the different States are able to obtain access to health insurance coverage and the circumstances for lack of access (if any) to such coverage.

>             “(A) limit the employers that may apply for such coverage to those with eligible individuals who live, work, or reside in the service area for such network plan; and

>             “(B)

>              within the service area of such plan, deny such coverage to such employers if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that—

>                 “(i) it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to enrollees of any additional groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees, and

>                 “(ii) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to all employers without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factor relating to such employees and dependents.

>         An issuer, upon denying health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), may not offer coverage in the small group market within such service area for a period of 180 days after the date such coverage is denied.

>     “(d) __Application of Financial Capacity Limits.—__ 

>         “(1) __In general.—__ 

>         A health insurance issuer may deny health insurance coverage in the small group market if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that—

>             “(A) it does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage; and

>             “(B) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to all employers in the small group market in the State consistent with applicable State law and without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factor relating to such employees and dependents.

>         “(2) __180-day suspension upon denial of coverage.—__ 

>         A health insurance issuer upon denying health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans in accordance with paragraph (1) in a State may not offer coverage in connection with group health plans in the small group market in the State for a period of 180 days after the date such coverage is denied or until the issuer has demonstrated to the applicable State authority, if required under applicable State law, that the issuer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever is later. An applicable State authority may provide for the application of this subsection on a service-area-specific basis.

>     “(e) __Exception to Requirement for Failure To Meet Certain Minimum Participation or Contribution Rules.—__ 

>         “(1) __In general.—__ 

>         Subsection (a) shall not be construed to preclude a health insurance issuer from establishing employer contribution rules or group participation rules for the offering of health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan in the small group market, as allowed under applicable State law.

>         “(2) __Rules defined.—__ 

>         For purposes of paragraph (1)—

>             “(A) the term ‘employer contribution rule’ means a requirement relating to the minimum level or amount of employer contribution toward the premium for enrollment of participants and beneficiaries; and

>             “(B) the term ‘group participation rule’ means a requirement relating to the minimum number of participants or beneficiaries that must be enrolled in relation to a specified percentage or number of eligible individuals or employees of an employer.

>     “(f) __Exception for Coverage Offered Only to Bona Fide Association Members.—__ 

>     Subsection (a) shall not apply to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer if such coverage is made available in the small group market only through one or more bona fide associations (as defined in [section 300gg–91(d)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91/d/3]).”
