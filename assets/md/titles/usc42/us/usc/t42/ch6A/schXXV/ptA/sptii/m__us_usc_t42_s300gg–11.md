## § 300gg–11. No lifetime or annual limits

    (a) __Prohibition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish—

            (A) lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary; or

            (B) except as provided in paragraph (2), annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.

        (2) __Annual limits prior to 2014__ 

            With respect to plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may only establish a restricted annual limit on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary with respect to the scope of benefits that are essential health benefits under [section 18022(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18022/b], as determined by the Secretary. In defining the term “restricted annual limit” for purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall ensure that access to needed services is made available with a minimal impact on premiums.

    (b) __Per beneficiary limits__ 

        Subsection (a) shall not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under [section 18022(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s18022/b], to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law.
