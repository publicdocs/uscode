    (a) __Program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may establish a program, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, consisting of awarding demonstration grants to States to streamline State requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who held certain military occupational specialties related to medical care or who have completed certain medical training while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States to meet certification, licensure, and other requirements applicable to civilian health care professions (such as emergency medical technician, paramedic, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, physical therapy assistant, or physician assistant professions) in the State.

        (2) __Consultation and collaboration__ 

            In determining the eligible military occupational specialties or training courses and the assistance required as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans’ Employment and Training, and shall collaborate with the initiatives carried out under [section 4114 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s4114] and sections 1142 through 1144 of title 10.

    (b) __Use of funds__ 

    Amounts received as a demonstration grant under this section shall be used to—

        (1)

         prepare and implement a plan to streamline State requirements and procedures as described in subsection (a), including by—

            (A) determining the extent to which the requirements for the education, training, and skill level of civilian health care professions (such as emergency medical technicians, paramedics, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, physical therapy assistants, or physician assistants) in the State are equivalent to requirements for the education, training, and skill level of veterans who served in medical related fields while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States; and

            (B) identifying methods, such as waivers, for veterans who served in medical related fields while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States to forgo or meet any such equivalent State requirements; and

        (2) if necessary to meet workforce shortages or address gaps in education, training, or skill level to meet certification, licensure or other requirements applicable to becoming a civilian health care professional (such as an emergency medical technician, paramedic, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, physical therapy assistant, or physician assistant professions) in the State, develop or expand career pathways at institutions of higher education to support veterans in meeting such requirements.

    (c) __Report__ 

        Upon the completion of the demonstration program under this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the program.

    (d) __Funding__ 

        No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of carrying out this section. This section shall be carried out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose.
