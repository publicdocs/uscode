        (2) __Purpose of payments__ 

            An entity receiving payments pursuant to paragraph (1) may expend the payments to recruit and employ a health professional to provide primary health services to patients of the entity, or to enter into a contract with such a professional to provide the services to the patients.

            The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest such amounts of the Fund as such Secretary determines are not required to meet current withdrawals from the Fund.
