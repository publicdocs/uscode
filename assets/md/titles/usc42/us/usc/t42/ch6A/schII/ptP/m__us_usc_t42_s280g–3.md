## § 280g–3. Controlled substance monitoring program

    (a) __Grants__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Each fiscal year, the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall award a grant to each State with an application approved under this section to enable the State—

            (A) to establish and implement a State controlled substance monitoring program;

            (B) to make improvements to an existing State controlled substance monitoring program; or

            (C) to maintain an existing State-controlled substance monitoring program.

        (2) __Determination of amount__ 

            (A) __Minimum amount__ 

                In making payments under a grant under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to each State with an application approved under this section an amount that equals 1.0 percent of the amount appropriated to carry out this section for that fiscal year.

            (B) __Additional amounts__ 

                In making payments under a grant under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to each State with an application approved under this section an additional amount which bears the same ratio to the amount appropriated to carry out this section for that fiscal year and remaining after amounts are made available under subparagraph (A) as the number of pharmacies of the State bears to the number of pharmacies of all States with applications approved under this section (as determined by the Secretary), except that the Secretary may adjust the amount allocated to a State under this subparagraph after taking into consideration the budget cost estimate for the State’s controlled substance monitoring program.

        (3) __Term of grants__ 

            Grants awarded under this section shall be obligated in the year in which funds are allotted.

    (b) __Minimum requirements__ 

        The Secretary shall maintain and, as appropriate, supplement or revise (after publishing proposed additions and revisions in the Federal Register and receiving public comments thereon) minimum requirements for criteria to be used by States for purposes of clauses (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii) of subsection (c)(1)(A).

    (c) __Application approval process__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, a State shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such assurances and information as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall include—

            (A)

             with respect to a State that intends to use funds under the grant as provided for in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section—

                (i) a budget cost estimate for the controlled substance monitoring program to be implemented under the grant;

                (ii) criteria for security for information handling and for the database maintained by the State under subsection (e) of this section generally including efforts to use appropriate encryption technology or other appropriate technology to protect the security of such information;

        (2) __State legislation__ 

            As part of an application under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall require a State to demonstrate that the State has enacted legislation or regulations to permit the implementation of the State controlled substance monitoring program and the imposition of appropriate penalties for the unauthorized use and disclosure of information maintained in such program.

        (3) __Interoperability__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If a State that submits an application under this subsection geographically borders another State that is operating a controlled substance monitoring program under subsection (a)(1) of this section on the date of submission of such application, and such applicant State has not achieved interoperability for purposes of information sharing between its monitoring program and the monitoring program of such border State, such applicant State shall, as part of the plan under paragraph (1)(B)(iii), describe the manner in which the applicant State will achieve interoperability between the monitoring programs of such States and include timelines for full implementation of such interoperability.

            (B) __Monitoring of efforts__ 

                The Secretary shall monitor State efforts to achieve interoperability, as described in subparagraph (A).

        (4) __Approval__ 

            If a State submits an application in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary shall approve such application.

        (5) __Return of funds__ 

            If the Secretary withdraws approval of a State’s application under this section, or the State chooses to cease to establish, improve, or maintain a controlled substance monitoring program under this section, a funding agreement for the receipt of a grant under this section is that the State will return to the Secretary an amount which bears the same ratio to the overall grant as the remaining time period for expending the grant funds bears to the overall time period for expending the grant (as specified by the Secretary at the time of the grant). The Secretary shall redistribute any funds that are so returned among the remaining grantees under this section in accordance with the formula described in subsection (a)(2)(B).

    (d) __Reporting requirements__
