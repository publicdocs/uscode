    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary may award grants to States, transplant centers, qualified organ procurement organizations under [section 273 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s273], or other public or private entities for the purpose of—

        (1) providing for the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by individuals toward making living donations of their organs (in this section referred to as “donating individuals”); and

        (2) providing for the reimbursement of such incidental nonmedical expenses that are so incurred as the Secretary determines by regulation to be appropriate.

    (b) __Preference__

        (2) the term “qualifying expenses” as including the expenses of having relatives or other individuals, not to exceed 2, accompany or assist the donating individual for purposes of subsection (a) of this section (subject to making payment for only those types of expenses that are paid for a donating individual).

    (d) __Relationship to payments under other programs__ 

    An award may be made under subsection (a) of this section only if the applicant involved agrees that the award will not be expended to pay the qualifying expenses of a donating individual to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to such expenses—

        (1) under any State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program;

        (2) by an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis; or

        (3) by the recipient of the organ.

    (e) __Definitions__
