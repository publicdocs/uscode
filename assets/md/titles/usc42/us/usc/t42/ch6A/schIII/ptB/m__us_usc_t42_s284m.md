## § 284m. Program for pediatric studies of drugs

    (a) __List of priority issues in pediatric therapeutics__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than one year after September 27, 2007, the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health and in consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and experts in pediatric research, shall develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, including drugs, biological products, or indications that require study. The list shall be revised every three years.

        (2) __Consideration of available information__ 

        In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary—

            (A)

             shall consider—

                (i) therapeutic gaps in pediatrics that may include developmental pharmacology, pharmacogenetic determinants of drug response, metabolism of drugs and biologics in children, and pediatric clinical trials;

                (ii) particular pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics, including drugs and biologics, may be beneficial in pediatric populations; and

                (iii) the adequacy of necessary infrastructure to conduct pediatric pharmacological research, including research networks and trained pediatric investigators; and

            (B) may consider the availability of qualified countermeasures (as defined in [section 247d–6a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6a]), security countermeasures (as defined in [section 247d–6b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6b]), and qualified pandemic or epidemic products (as defined in [section 247d–6d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6d]) to address the needs of pediatric populations, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, consistent with the purposes of this section.

    (b) __Pediatric studies and research__ 

        The Secretary, acting through the National Institutes of Health, shall award funds to entities that have the expertise to conduct pediatric clinical trials or other research (including qualified universities, hospitals, laboratories, contract research organizations, practice groups, federally funded programs such as pediatric pharmacology research units, other public or private institutions, or individuals) to enable the entities to conduct the drug studies or other research on the issues described in paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) of subsection (a). The Secretary may use contracts, grants, or other appropriate funding mechanisms to award funds under this subsection.

    (c) __Process for proposed pediatric study requests and labeling changes__ 

        (1) __Submission of proposed pediatric study request__ 

        The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall, as appropriate, submit proposed pediatric study requests for consideration by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for pediatric studies of a specific pediatric indication identified under subsection (a). Such a proposed pediatric study request shall be made in a manner equivalent to a written request made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 355a][/us/usc/t21/s355a]\], or [section 262(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s262/m], including with respect to the information provided on the pediatric studies to be conducted pursuant to the request. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may submit a proposed pediatric study request for a drug for which—

            (A)

                (i) there is an approved application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 355(j)][/us/usc/t21/s355/j]\] or [section 262(k) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s262/k]; or
