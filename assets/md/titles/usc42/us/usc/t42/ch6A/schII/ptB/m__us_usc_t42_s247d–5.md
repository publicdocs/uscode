## § 247d–5. Combating antimicrobial resistance

    (a) __Task force__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish an Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary and coordinate Federal programs relating to antimicrobial resistance. The Secretary may appoint or select a committee, or other organization in existence as of November 13, 2000, to serve as such a task force, if such committee, or other organization meets the requirements of this section.

        (2) __Members of task force__ 

            The task force described in paragraph (1) shall be composed of representatives from such Federal agencies, and shall seek input from public health constituencies, manufacturers, veterinary and medical professional societies and others, as determined to be necessary by the Secretary, to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to address the public health threat of antimicrobial resistance.

        (3) __Agenda__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The task force described in paragraph (1) shall consider factors the Secretary considers appropriate, including—

                (i) public health factors contributing to increasing antimicrobial resistance;

                (ii) public health needs to detect and monitor antimicrobial resistance;

                (iii) detection, prevention, and control strategies for resistant pathogens;

                (iv) the need for improved information and data collection;

                (v) the assessment of the risk imposed by pathogens presenting a threat to the public health; and

                (vi) any other issues which the Secretary determines are relevant to antimicrobial resistance.

            (B) __Detection and control__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the task force described in paragraph (1) and State and local public health officials, shall—

                (i) develop, improve, coordinate or enhance participation in a surveillance plan to detect and monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance; and

                (ii) develop, improve, coordinate or enhance participation in an integrated information system to assimilate, analyze, and exchange antimicrobial resistance data between public health departments.

        (4) __Meetings__ 

            The task force described under paragraph (1) shall convene not less than twice a year, or more frequently as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

    (b) __Research and development of new antimicrobial drugs and diagnostics__ 

    The Secretary and the Director of Agricultural Research Services, consistent with the recommendations of the task force established under subsection (a) of this section, shall directly or through awards of grants or cooperative agreements to public or private entities provide for the conduct of research, investigations, experiments, demonstrations, and studies in the health sciences that are related to—

        (1) the development of new therapeutics, including vaccines and antimicrobials, against resistant pathogens;

        (2) the development or testing of medical diagnostics to detect pathogens resistant to antimicrobials;

        (3) the epidemiology, mechanisms, and pathogenesis of antimicrobial resistance;

        (4) the sequencing of the genomes, or other DNA analysis, or other comparative analysis, of priority pathogens (as determined by the Director of the National Institutes of Health in consultation with the task force established under subsection (a) of this section), in collaboration and coordination with the activities of the Department of Defense and the Joint Genome Institute of the Department of Energy; and

        (5) other relevant research areas.

    (c) __Education of medical and public health personnel__

        (1) develop and implement educational programs to increase the awareness of the general public with respect to the public health threat of antimicrobial resistance and the appropriate use of antibiotics;

        (2) develop and implement educational programs to instruct health care professionals in the prudent use of antibiotics; and

        (3) develop and implement programs to train laboratory personnel in the recognition or identification of resistance in pathogens.

    (d) __Grants__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall award competitive grants to eligible entities to enable such entities to increase the capacity to detect, monitor, and combat antimicrobial resistance.

        (2) __Eligible entities__

            (A) provide training to enable such entity to identify patterns of resistance rapidly and accurately;

            (B) develop, improve, coordinate or enhance participation in information systems by which data on resistant infections can be shared rapidly among relevant national, State, and local health agencies and health care providers; and

            (C) develop and implement policies to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

    (e) __Grants for demonstration programs__ 

        (1) __In general__
