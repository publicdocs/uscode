        (2) __Authorized expenditures__ 

        A grant or contract under paragraph (1) may be used by the entity to meet the cost of—

            (A) identifying, recruiting, and selecting individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, as so determined, for education and training in a health profession;

            (B) facilitating the entry of such individuals into such a school;

            (C) providing counseling, mentoring, or other services designed to assist such individuals to complete successfully their education at such a school;

            (D) providing, for a period prior to the entry of such individuals into the regular course of education of such a school, preliminary education and health research training designed to assist them to complete successfully such regular course of education at such a school, or referring such individuals to institutions providing such preliminary education;

            (E) publicizing existing sources of financial aid available to students in the education program of such a school or who are undertaking training necessary to qualify them to enroll in such a program;

            (F) paying such scholarships as the Secretary may determine for such individuals for any period of health professions education at a health professions school;

            (G) paying such stipends as the Secretary may approve for such individuals for any period of education in student-enhancement programs (other than regular courses), except that such a stipend may not be provided to an individual for more than 12 months, and such a stipend shall be in an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary (notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the amount of stipends);

            (H) carrying out programs under which such individuals gain experience regarding a career in a field of primary health care through working at facilities of public or private nonprofit community-based providers of primary health services; and

            (I) conducting activities to develop a larger and more competitive applicant pool through partnerships with institutions of higher education, school districts, and other community-based entities.

        (3) __Definition__ 

            In this section, the term “regular course of education of such a school” as used in subparagraph (D) includes a graduate program in behavioral or mental health.

    (b) __Requirements for awards__ 

    In making awards to eligible entities under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall give preference to approved applications for programs that involve a comprehensive approach by several public or nonprofit private health or educational entities to establish, enhance and expand educational programs that will result in the development of a competitive applicant pool of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who desire to pursue health professions careers. In considering awards for such a comprehensive partnership approach, the following shall apply with respect to the entity involved:

        (1) The entity shall have a demonstrated commitment to such approach through formal agreements that have common objectives with institutions of higher education, school districts, and other community-based entities.

        (2) Such formal agreements shall reflect the coordination of educational activities and support services, increased linkages, and the consolidation of resources within a specific geographic area.

        (3) The design of the educational activities involved shall provide for the establishment of a competitive health professions applicant pool of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds by enhancing the total preparation (academic and social) of such individuals to pursue a health professions career.

        (4) The programs or activities under the award shall focus on developing a culturally competent health care workforce that will serve the unserved and underserved populations within the geographic area.

    (c) __Equitable allocation of financial assistance__ 

        The Secretary, to the extent practicable, shall ensure that services and activities under subsection (a) of this section are adequately allocated among the various racial and ethnic populations who are from disadvantaged backgrounds.

    (d) __Matching requirements__ 

        The Secretary may require that an entity that applies for a grant or contract under subsection (a) of this section, provide non-Federal matching funds, as appropriate, to ensure the institutional commitment of the entity to the projects funded under the grant or contract. As determined by the Secretary, such non-Federal matching funds may be provided directly or through donations from public or private entities and may be in cash or in-kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services.
