## § 300m. Requirements with respect to type and quality of services

    (a) __Requirement of provision of all services by date certain__ 

    The Secretary may not make a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] unless the State involved agrees—

        (1) to ensure that, initially and throughout the period during which amounts are received pursuant to the grant, not less than 60 percent of the grant is expended to provide each of the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a], including making available screening procedures for both breast and cervical cancers;

        (2)

         subject to subsection (b) of this section, to ensure that—

            (A) in the case of breast cancer, both a physical examination of the breasts and the screening procedure known as a mammography are conducted; and

            (B) in the case of cervical cancer, both a pelvic examination and the screening procedure known as a pap smear are conducted;

        (3) to ensure that, by the end of any second fiscal year of payments pursuant to the grant, each of the services or activities described in [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a] is provided; and

        (4) to ensure that not more than 40 percent of the grant is expended to provide the services or activities described in paragraphs (3) through (6) of such section.

    (b) __Use of improved screening procedures__ 

        The Secretary may not make a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] unless the State involved agrees that, if any screening procedure superior to a procedure described in subsection (a)(2) of this section becomes commonly available and is recommended for use, any entity providing screening procedures pursuant to the grant will utilize the superior procedure rather than the procedure described in such subsection.

    (c) __Quality assurance regarding screening procedures__ 

        The Secretary may not make a grant under [section 300k of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k] unless the State involved agrees that the State will, in accordance with applicable law, assure the quality of screening procedures conducted pursuant to such section.

    (d) __Waiver of services requirement on division of funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a demonstration project under which the Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (4) of subsection (a) for not more than 5 States, if—

            (A) the State involved will use the waiver to leverage non-Federal funds to supplement each of the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a];

            (B) the application of such requirement would result in a barrier to the enrollment of qualifying women;

            (C)

             the State involved—

                (i) demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, the manner in which the State will use such waiver to expand the level of screening and follow-up services provided immediately prior to the date on which the waiver is granted; and

                (ii) provides assurances, satisfactory to the Secretary, that the State will, on an annual basis, demonstrate, through such documentation as the Secretary may require, that the State has used such waiver as described in clause (i);

            (D)

             the State involved submits to the Secretary—

                (i)

                 assurances, satisfactory to the Secretary, that the State will maintain the average annual level of State fiscal year expenditures for the services and activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a] for the period for which the waiver is granted, and for the period for which any extension of such wavier  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “waiver”. </sup></sup>  is granted, at a level that is not less than—

                    (I) the level of the State fiscal year expenditures for such services and activities for the fiscal year preceding the first fiscal year for which the waiver is granted; or

                    (II) at the option of the State and upon approval by the Secretary, the average level of the State expenditures for such services and activities for the 3-fiscal year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the waiver is granted; and

                (ii) a plan, satisfactory to the Secretary, for maintaining the level of activities carried out under the waiver after the expiration of the waiver and any extension of such waiver;

            (E) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a State will increase the number of women in the State that receive each of the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a], including making available screening procedures for both breast and cervical cancers; and

            (F) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a State will not adversely affect the quality of each of the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a].

        (2) __Duration of waiver__

                (i) without an extension of the waiver, there will be a barrier to the enrollment of qualifying women;

                (ii) the State requesting such extended waiver will use the waiver to leverage non-Federal funds to supplement the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a];

                (iii) the waiver has increased, and will continue to increase, the number of women in the State that receive the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a];

                (iv) the waiver has not, and will not, result in lower quality in the State of the services or activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a]; and

                (v)

                 the State has maintained the average annual level of State fiscal expenditures for the services and activities described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 300k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300k/a] for the period for which the waiver was granted at a level that is not less than—
