                        (aa) have received appropriate training in administering a drug or device approved or cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose; and

            (C) ensures the capability of data sharing with other States, where applicable, such as by making data available to a prescription monitoring hub;

            (D) ensures that data recorded in the prescription drug monitoring program database of the State are regularly updated, to the extent possible;

            (E) ensures that the prescription drug monitoring program of the State notifies prescribers and dispensers of schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances when overuse or misuse of such controlled substances by patients is suspected; and

            (F) has in effect one or more statutes or implements policies that maximize use of prescription drug monitoring programs by individuals authorized by the State to prescribe schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances.

        (6) __Evaluation__ 

            In conducting an evaluation of the program under this section pursuant to section 701 of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, with respect to a State, the Secretary shall report on State legislation or policies related to maximizing the use of prescription drug monitoring programs and the incidence of opioid use disorders and overdose deaths in such State.

        (7) __States with local prescription drug monitoring programs__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a State that does not have a prescription drug monitoring program, a county or other unit of local government within the State that has a prescription drug monitoring program shall be treated as a State for purposes of this section, including for purposes of eligibility for grants under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Plan for interoperability__ 

                In submitting an application to the Secretary under paragraph (3), a county or other unit of local government shall submit a plan outlining the methods such county or unit of local government shall use to ensure the capability of data sharing with other counties and units of local government within the state and with other States, as applicable.
