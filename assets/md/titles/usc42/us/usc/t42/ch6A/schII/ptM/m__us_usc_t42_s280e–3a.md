> “SEC. 2. __FINDINGS__ 

> “Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.

>     “(2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20 years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS, combined.

>     “(3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with cancer.

>     “(4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from cancer.

>     “(5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age 20.

>     “(6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so resistant that even in spite of the great research strides made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the children with cancer can now be cured.

>     “(7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.

>     “(8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.

>     “(9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites in the body.

>     “(10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children’s Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United States.

> “SEC. 3. __PURPOSES__ 

> “It is the purpose of this Act \[see Short Title of 2008 Amendment note set out under [section 201 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s201]\] to authorize appropriations to—

>     “(1) encourage the support for pediatric cancer research and other activities related to pediatric cancer;

>     “(2) establish a comprehensive national childhood cancer registry; and

>     “(3) provide informational services to patients and families affected by childhood cancer.”
