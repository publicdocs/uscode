        The Secretary shall award grants to poison control centers accredited under subsection (c) (or granted a waiver under subsection (d)) and professional organizations in the field of poison control for the purposes of preventing, and providing treatment recommendations for, poisonings and complying with the operational requirements needed to sustain the accreditation of the center under subsection (c).

    (b) __Additional uses of funds__ 

    In addition to the purposes described in subsection (a), a poison center or professional organization awarded a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under such subsection may also use amounts received under such grant, contract, or cooperative agreement—

        (1) to research, establish, implement, and evaluate best practices in the United States for poison prevention, poison control center outreach, and emergency and preparedness programs;

        (2) to research, develop, implement, revise, and communicate standard patient management guidelines for commonly encountered toxic exposures;

        (3) to improve national toxic exposure surveillance by enhancing cooperative activities between poison control centers in the United States and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;

        (4) to research, improve, and enhance the communications and response capability and capacity of the nation’s network of poison control centers to facilitate increased access to the centers through the integration and modernization of the current poison control centers communications and data system, including enhancing the network’s telephony, Internet, data and social networking technologies;

        (5) to develop, support, and enhance technology and capabilities of professional organizations in the field of poison control to collect national poisoning, toxic occurrence, and related public health data;

        (6) to develop initiatives to foster the enhanced public health utilization of national poison data collected by organizations described in paragraph (5);

        (7) to support and expand the toxicologic expertise within poison control centers; and

        (8) to improve the capacity of poison control centers to answer high volumes of calls and Internet communications, and to sustain and enhance the poison control center’s network capability to respond during times of national crisis or other public health emergencies.

    (c) __Accreditation__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (d), the Secretary may award a grant to a poison control center under subsection (a) only if—

        (1) the center has been accredited by a professional organization in the field of poison control, and the Secretary has approved the organization as having in effect standards for accreditation that reasonably provide for the protection of the public health with respect to poisoning; or

        (2) the center has been accredited by a State government, and the Secretary has approved the State government as having in effect standards for accreditation that reasonably provide for the protection of the public health with respect to poisoning.

    (d) __Waiver of accreditation requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may grant a waiver of the accreditation requirements of subsection (c) with respect to a nonaccredited poison control center that applies for a grant under this section if such center can reasonably demonstrate that the center will obtain such an accreditation within a reasonable period of time as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

        (2) __Renewal__ 

            The Secretary may renew a waiver under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Limitation__

    (e) __Supplement not supplant__ 

        Amounts made available to a poison control center under this section shall be used to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State or local funds provided for such center.

    (f) __Maintenance of effort__ 

        A poison control center, in utilizing the proceeds of a grant under this section, shall maintain the expenditures of the center for its activities at a level that is not less than the level of expenditures maintained by the center for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is received.

    (g) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, $28,600,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.
