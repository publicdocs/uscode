        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may grant a waiver of the certification requirements of subsection (c) with respect to a noncertified poison control center that applies for a grant under this section if such center can reasonably demonstrate that the center will obtain such a certification within a reasonable period of time as determined appropriate by the Secretary.
