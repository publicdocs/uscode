## § 300gg–45. Relief for high risk pools

    (a) __Seed grants to States__ 

        The Secretary shall provide from the funds appropriated under subsection (d)(1)(A) a grant of up to $1,000,000 to each State that has not created a qualified high risk pool as of February 10, 2006, for the State’s costs of creation and initial operation of such a pool.

    (b) __Grants for operational losses__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of a State that has established a qualified high risk pool that—

            (A) restricts premiums charged under the pool to no more than 200 percent of the premium for applicable standard risk rates;

            (B) offers a choice of two or more coverage options through the pool; and

            (C) has in effect a mechanism reasonably designed to ensure continued funding of losses incurred by the State in connection with operation of the pool after the end of the last fiscal year for which a grant is provided under this paragraph;

            the Secretary shall provide, from the funds appropriated under paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(A) of subsection (d) and allotted to the State under paragraph (2), a grant for the losses incurred by the State in connection with the operation of the pool.

        (2) __Allotment__ 

        Subject to paragraph (4), the amounts appropriated under paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(A) of subsection (d) for a fiscal year shall be allotted and made available to the States (or the entities that operate the high risk pool under applicable State law) that qualify for a grant under paragraph (1) as follows:

            (A) An amount equal to 40 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted in equal amounts to each qualifying State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia and that applies for a grant under this subsection.

            (B) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to such a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of uninsured individuals in the State bears to the total number of uninsured individuals (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.

            (C) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of individuals enrolled in health care coverage through the qualified high risk pool of the State bears to the total number of individuals so enrolled through qualified high risk pools (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.

        (3) __Special rule for pools charging higher premiums__ 

            In the case of a qualified high risk pool of a State which charges premiums that exceed 150 percent of the premium for applicable standard risks, the State shall use at least 50 percent of the amount of the grant provided to the State to carry out this subsection to reduce premiums for enrollees.

        (4) __Limitation for territories__ 

            In no case shall the aggregate amount allotted and made available under paragraph (2) for a fiscal year to States that are not the 50 States or the District of Columbia exceed $1,000,000.

    (c) __Bonus grants for supplemental consumer benefits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of a State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, that has established a qualified high risk pool, and that is receiving a grant under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary shall provide, from the funds appropriated under paragraphs (1)(B)(ii) and (2)(B) of subsection (d) and allotted to the State under paragraph (3), a grant to be used to provide supplemental consumer benefits to enrollees or potential enrollees (or defined subsets of such enrollees or potential enrollees) in qualified high risk pools.

        (2) __Benefits__ 

        A State shall use amounts received under a grant under this subsection to provide one or more of the following benefits:

            (A) Low-income premium subsidies.

            (B) A reduction in premium trends, actual premiums, or other cost-sharing requirements.

            (C) An expansion or broadening of the pool of individuals eligible for coverage, such as through eliminating waiting lists, increasing enrollment caps, or providing flexibility in enrollment rules.

            (D) Less stringent rules, or additional waiver authority, with respect to coverage of pre-existing conditions.

            (E) Increased benefits.

            (F) The establishment of disease management programs.

        (3) __Allotment; limitation__ 

            The Secretary shall allot funds appropriated under paragraphs (1)(B)(ii) and (2)(B) of subsection (d) among States qualifying for a grant under paragraph (1) in a manner specified by the Secretary, but in no case shall the amount so allotted to a State for a fiscal year exceed 10 percent of the funds so appropriated for the fiscal year.

        (4) __Rule of construction__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a State that, on February 10, 2006, is in the process of implementing a program to provide benefits of the type described in paragraph (2), from being eligible for a grant under this subsection.
