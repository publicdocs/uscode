        (2) __Research__ 

            Each center under paragraph (1) shall conduct basic and clinical research into autism spectrum disorder. Such research should include investigations into the cause, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, control, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder. The centers, as a group, shall conduct research including the fields of developmental neurobiology, genetics, and psychopharmacology.

        (3) __Services for patients__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A center under paragraph (1) may expend amounts provided under such paragraph to carry out a program to make individuals aware of opportunities to participate as subjects in research conducted by the centers.

            (B) __Referrals and costs__ 

                A program under subparagraph (A) may, in accordance with such criteria as the Director may establish, provide to the subjects described in such subparagraph, referrals for health and other services, and such patient care costs as are required for research.

    (c) __Facilitation of research__ 

        The Director shall under subsection (a)(1) of this section provide for a program under which samples of tissues and genetic materials that are of use in research on autism spectrum disorder are donated, collected, preserved, and made available for such research. The program shall be carried out in accordance with accepted scientific and medical standards for the donation, collection, and preservation of such samples.

    (d) __Public input__
