In enhancing, expanding, and intensifying such research and other activities, the Secretary is encouraged to take into consideration the application of such research and other activities for minority, health disparity, and medically underserved communities.

            (C) direct resource services such as educational outreach for parents, peer-to-peer and parent-to-parent support networks, information on school re-entry and postsecondary education, and resource directories or referral services for financial assistance, psychological counseling, and other support services.

            In awarding grants under this paragraph, the Secretary is encouraged to take into consideration the extent to which an entity would use such grant for purposes of making activities and services described in this paragraph available to minority, health disparity, and medically underserved communities.

        (2) __Performance measurement, transparency, and accountability__ 

            For each grant awarded under this subsection, the Secretary shall develop and implement metrics-based performance measures to assess the effectiveness of activities funded under such grant.
