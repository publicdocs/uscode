        (2) the Secretary shall, for the purpose of providing reimbursements for tax liability resulting from payments made under paragraph (1) on behalf of an individual, make payments, in addition to payments under such paragraph, to the individual in an amount equal to 39 percent of the total amount of loan repayments made for the taxable year involved.

    (b) __Application of other provisions__ 

        The provisions of sections 254l–1, 254m, and 254o of this title shall, except as inconsistent with paragraph (1), apply to the program established under such paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such provisions apply to the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program established under subpart III of part D of subchapter II of this chapter.

    (c) __Funding__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For the purpose of carrying out this section with respect to a national research institute the Secretary may reserve, from amounts appropriated for such institute for the fiscal year involved, such amounts as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
