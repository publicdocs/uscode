        (1) __Minimum allotment__ 

        Subject to the extent of amounts made available under [section 300ff–31b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–31b], the amount of a grant to be made under [section 300ff–21 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–21] for—

            (A)

             each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands (referred to in this paragraph as a “covered State”) for a fiscal year shall be the greater of—

                (i)

                    (I) with respect to a covered State that has less than 90 living cases of AIDS, as determined under paragraph (2)(D), $200,000; or

                    (II) with respect to a covered State that has 90 or more living cases of AIDS, as determined under paragraph (2)(D), $500,000; and

                (ii) an amount determined under paragraph (2) and then, as applicable, increased under paragraph (2)(H); and

            (B) each territory other than Guam and the Virgin Islands shall be the greater of $50,000 or an amount determined under paragraph (2).

        (2) __Determination__ 

            (A) __Formula__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the amount referred to in this paragraph for a State (including a territory) for a fiscal year is, subject to subparagraphs (E) and (F)—

                (i) an amount equal to the amount made available under [section 300ff–31b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–31b] for the fiscal year involved for grants pursuant to paragraph (1), subject to subparagraph (F); and

                (ii)

                 the percentage constituted by the sum of—

                    (I) the product of 0.75 and the ratio of the State distribution factor for the State or territory (as determined under subsection (B)) to the sum of the respective State distribution factors for all States or territories;

                    (II) the product of .20 and the ratio of the non-EMA distribution factor for the State or territory (as determined under subparagraph (C)) to the sum of the respective non-EMA distribution factors for all States or territories; and

                    (III) if the State does not for such fiscal year contain any area that is an eligible area under subpart I of part A or any area that is a transitional area under [section 300ff–19 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19] (referred to in this subclause as a “no-EMA State”), the product of 0.05 and the ratio of the number of cases that applies for the State under subparagraph (D) to the sum of the respective numbers of cases that so apply for all no-EMA States.

            (B) __State distribution factor__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(I), the term “State distribution factor” means an amount equal to the number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in the State involved, as determined under subparagraph (D).

            (C) __Non-EMA distribution factor__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), the term “non-ema  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “ ‘non-EMA”. </sup></sup>  distribution factor” means an amount equal to the sum of—

                (i) the number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in the State involved, as determined under subparagraph (D); less

                (ii)

                 a number equal to the sum of—

                    (I) the total number of living cases of HIV/AIDS that are within areas in such State that are eligible areas under subpart I of part A for the fiscal year involved, which individual number for an area is the number that applies under [section 300ff–11 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–11] for the area for such fiscal year; and

                    (II) the total number of such cases that are within areas in such State that are transitional areas under [section 300ff–19 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19] for such fiscal year, which individual number for an area is the number that applies under such section for the fiscal year.

            (D) __Living cases of HIV/AIDS__ 

                (i) __Requirement of names-based reporting__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (ii), the number determined under this subparagraph for a State for a fiscal year for purposes of subparagraph (B) is the number of living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS in the State that, as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available, have been reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

                (ii) __Transition period; exemption regarding non-AIDS cases__ 

                For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, a State is, subject to clauses (iii) through (v), exempt from the requirement under clause (i) that living non-AIDS names-based cases of HIV be reported unless—

                    (I) a system was in operation as of December 31, 2005, that provides sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases throughout the State, subject to clause (vii); or

                    (II) no later than the beginning of fiscal year 2008 or a subsequent fiscal year through fiscal year 2012, the Secretary, after consultation with the chief executive of the State, determines that a system has become operational in the State that provides sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases throughout the State.

                (iii) __Requirements for exemption for fiscal year 2007__ 

                For fiscal year 2007, an exemption under clause (ii) for a State applies only if, by October 1, 2006—

                    (I)

                        (aa) the State had submitted to the Secretary a plan for making the transition to sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of living non-AIDS cases of HIV; or

                        (bb) all statutory changes necessary to provide for sufficiently accurate and reliable reporting of such cases had been made; and

                    (II) the State had agreed that, by April 1, 2008, the State will begin accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases, except that such agreement is not required to provide that, as of such date, the system for such reporting be fully sufficient with respect to accuracy and reliability throughout the area.

                (iv) __Requirement for exemption as of fiscal year 2008__ 

                    For each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012, an exemption under clause (ii) for a State applies only if, as of April 1, 2008, the State is substantially in compliance with the agreement under clause (iii)(II).

                (v) __Progress toward names-based reporting__ 

                    For fiscal year 2009 or a subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary may terminate an exemption under clause (ii) for a State if the State submitted a plan under clause (iii)(I)(aa) and the Secretary determines that the State is not substantially following the plan.

                (vi) __Counting of cases in areas with exemptions__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        With respect to a State that is under a reporting system for living non-AIDS cases of HIV that is not names-based (referred to in this subparagraph as “code-based reporting”), the Secretary shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, modify the number of such cases reported for the State in order to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting.

                    (II) __Adjustment rate__ 

                        The adjustment rate under subclause (I) for a State shall be a reduction of 5 percent for fiscal years before fiscal year 2012 (and 6 percent for fiscal year 2012) in the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for the State.

                    (III) __Increased adjustment for certain States previously using code-based reporting__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the Secretary shall deem the applicable number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in a State that were reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be 3 percent higher than the actual number if—

                        (aa) there is an area in such State that satisfies all of the conditions described in items (aa) through (cc) of [section 300ff–13(a)(3)(C)(vi)(III) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–13/a/3/C/vi/III]; or

                        (bb)

                            (AA) fiscal year 2007 was the first year in which the count of living non-AIDS cases of HIV in such area, for purposes of this part, was based on a names-based reporting system; and

                            (BB) the amount of funding that such State received under this part for fiscal year 2007 was less than 70 percent of the amount of funding that such State received under such part for fiscal year 2006.

                (vii) __List of States meeting standard regarding__  __December 31, 2005__ 

                    (I) __In general__

                    (I) __Cases of AIDS__ 

                        With respect to a State that is subject to the requirement under clause (i) and is not in compliance with the requirement for names-based reporting of living non-AIDS cases of HIV, the Secretary shall, notwithstanding such noncompliance, accept reports of living cases of AIDS that are in accordance with such clause.

                    (II) __Applicability of exemption requirements__ 

                        The provisions of clauses (ii) through (vii) may not be construed as having any legal effect for fiscal year 2013 or any subsequent fiscal year, and accordingly, the status of a State for purposes of such clauses may not be considered after fiscal year 2012.

                (ix) __Program for detecting inaccurate or fraudulent counting__ 

                    The Secretary shall carry out a program to monitor the reporting of names-based cases for purposes of this subparagraph and to detect instances of inaccurate reporting, including fraudulent reporting.

                (x) __Future fiscal years__ 

                    For fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2013, determinations under this paragraph shall be based only on living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS with respect to the State involved.

            (E) __Code-based States; limitation on increase in grant__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, if code-based reporting (within the meaning of subparagraph (D)(vi)) applies in a State as of the beginning of the fiscal year involved, then notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount of the grant pursuant to paragraph (1) for the State may not for the fiscal year involved exceed by more than 5 percent the amount of the grant pursuant to this paragraph for the State for the preceding fiscal year, except that the limitation under this clause may not result in a grant pursuant to paragraph (1) for a fiscal year that is less than the minimum amount that applies to the State under such paragraph for such fiscal year.

                (ii) __Use of amounts involved__ 

                    For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, amounts available as a result of the limitation under clause (i) shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants pursuant to [section 300ff–29a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–29a], subject to subparagraph (H).

                    (I) 100 percent of such amount, less the percentage reserved under clause (ii)(V); and

                    (II) the percentage constituted by the ratio of the State distribution factor for the State (as determined under subparagraph (B)) to the sum of the State distribution factors for all States;

                 which product shall then, as applicable, be increased under subparagraph (H).

                (ii) __Supplemental treatment drug grants__

                        From amounts made available under subclause (V), the Secretary shall award supplemental grants to States described in subclause (II) to enable such States to purchase and distribute to eligible individuals under [section 300ff–26(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–26/b] pharmaceutical therapeutics described under subsections (c)(2) and (e) of such section.

                    (II) __Eligible States__ 

                        For purposes of subclause (I), a State shall be an eligible State if the State did not have unobligated funds subject to reallocation under subsection (d) in the previous fiscal year and, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, demonstrates a severe need for a grant under this clause. For purposes of determining severe need, the Secretary shall consider eligibility standards, formulary composition, the number of eligible individuals to whom a State is unable to provide therapeutics described in [section 300ff–26(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–26/a], and an unanticipated increase of eligible individuals with HIV/AIDS.

The provisions of this subclause shall apply to States that are not required to comply with such [section 300ff–27(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–27/d].

                    (IV) __Use and coordination__ 

                        Amounts made available under a grant under this clause shall only be used by the State to provide HIV/AIDS-related medications. The State shall coordinate the use of such amounts with the amounts otherwise provided under [section 300ff–26(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–26/a] in order to maximize drug coverage.

                    (V) __Funding__ 

                        For the purpose of making grants under this clause, the Secretary shall each fiscal year reserve 5 percent of the amount referred to in clause (i) with respect to [section 300ff–26 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–26].

                (iii) __Code-based States; limitation on increase in formula grant__ 

                    The limitation under subparagraph (E)(i) applies to grants pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such limitation applies to grants pursuant to paragraph (1), except that the reference to minimum grants does not apply for purposes of this clause. Amounts available as a result of the limitation under the preceding sentence shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants under clause (ii) of this subparagraph.

A reduction under the preceding sentence may not be made in an amount that would result in the State involved becoming eligible for such an increase.

                    This paragraph may not be construed as having any applicability after fiscal year 2013.

    (b) __Allocation of assistance by States__
