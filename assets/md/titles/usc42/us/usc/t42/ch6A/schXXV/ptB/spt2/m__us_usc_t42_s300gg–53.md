            Nothing in paragraph (1) or in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) shall be construed to preclude a health insurance issuer from establishing rules for eligibility for an individual to enroll in individual health insurance coverage based on the manifestation of a disease or disorder in that individual, or in a family member of such individual where such family member is covered under the policy that covers such individual.

            (A) __In general__ 

                Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to preclude a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market from obtaining and using the results of a genetic test in making a determination regarding payment (as such term is defined for the purposes of applying the regulations promulgated by the Secretary under part C of title XI of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1320d][/us/usc/t42/s1320d] et seq.\] and section 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as may be revised from time to time) consistent with subsection  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original.

            (D) The issuer notifies the Secretary in writing that the issuer is conducting activities pursuant to the exception provided for under this paragraph, including a description of the activities conducted.

            (E) The issuer complies with such other conditions as the Secretary may by regulation require for activities conducted under this paragraph.

    (e) __Prohibition on collection of genetic information__
