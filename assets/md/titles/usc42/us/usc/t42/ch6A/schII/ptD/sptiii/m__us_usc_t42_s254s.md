 __Amendments__ 

    2002—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 107–116][/us/pl/107/116], which directed the amendment of subsec. (a) by substituting “Papa Ola Lokahi” for “Kamehameha School/Bishop Estate”, was executed by making the substitution for “Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1990—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 101–644][/us/pl/101/644], which directed the general amendment of subsec. (a) of section 338J of the Public Health Service Act, was executed to subsec.

(a) read as follows: “Subject to the availability of funds appropriated under the authority of subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall provide scholarship assistance, pursuant to a contract with the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, to students who—

    “(1) meet the requirements of section 254l(b) of this title, and
