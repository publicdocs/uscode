            (A) identifying, developing, and testing the most promising new screening technologies, in order to improve already existing screening tests, increase the specificity of newborn screening, and expand the number of conditions for which screening tests are available;

            (B) experimental treatments and disease management strategies for additional newborn conditions, and other genetic, metabolic, hormonal, or functional conditions that can be detected through newborn screening for which treatment is not yet available;

            (C) providing research findings and data for newborn conditions under review by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to be added to the recommended uniform screening panel;

            (D) conducting pilot studies on conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to ensure that screenings are ready for nationwide implementation; and

            (E) other activities that would improve newborn screening, as identified by the Director.

        (2) __Additional newborn condition__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “additional newborn condition” means any condition that is not one of the core conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee and adopted by the Secretary.

    (b) __Funding__ 

        In carrying out the research program under this section, the Secretary and the Director shall ensure that entities receiving funding through the program will provide assurances, as practicable, that such entities will work in consultation with the appropriate State departments of health, and, as practicable, focus their research on screening technology not currently performed in the States in which the entities are located, and the conditions on the uniform screening panel (or the standard test existing on the uniform screening panel).

    (c) __Reports__ 

        The Director is encouraged to include information about the activities carried out under this section in the biennial report required under [section 283 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s283].
