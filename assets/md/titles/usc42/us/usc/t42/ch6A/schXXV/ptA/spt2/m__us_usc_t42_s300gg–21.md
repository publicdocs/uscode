            (A) subject to paragraph (2), in the case of a plan that is a nonfederal governmental plan, and

            (B) with respect to health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan (including such a plan that is a church plan or a governmental plan).

        (2) __Treatment of non-Federal governmental plans__ 

            (A) __Election to be excluded__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (D) or (E), if the plan sponsor of a nonfederal governmental plan which is a group health plan to which the provisions of subparts 1 and 2 1 otherwise apply makes an election under this subparagraph (in such form and manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe), then the requirements of such subparts insofar as they apply directly to group health plans (and not merely to group health insurance coverage) shall not apply to such governmental plans for such period except as provided in this paragraph.

            (B) __Period of election__ 

            An election under subparagraph (A) shall apply—

                (i) for a single specified plan year, or

                (ii) in the case of a plan provided pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for the term of such agreement.

                An election under clause (i) may be extended through subsequent elections under this paragraph.

            (C) __Notice to enrollees__ 

            Under such an election, the plan shall provide for—

                (i) notice to enrollees (on an annual basis and at the time of enrollment under the plan) of the fact and consequences of such election, and

                (ii) certification and disclosure of creditable coverage under the plan with respect to enrollees in accordance with section 2701(e).1

            (D) __Election not applicable to requirements concerning genetic information__ 

                The election described in subparagraph (A) shall not be available with respect to the provisions of subsections (a)(1)(F), (b)(3), (c), and (d) of section 2702 1 and the provisions of sections 2701 1 and 2702(b) 1 to the extent that such provisions apply to genetic information.

            (E) __Election not applicable__ 

                The election described in subparagraph (A) shall not be available with respect to the provisions of subparts I and II.

    (b) __Exception for certain benefits__ 

        The requirements of subparts 1 and 2 1 shall not apply to any individual coverage or any group health plan (or group health insurance coverage) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in [section 300gg–91(c)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91/c/1].

    (c) __Exception for certain benefits if certain conditions met__ 

        (1) __Limited, excepted benefits__ 

        The requirements of subparts 1 and 2 1 shall not apply to any individual coverage or any group health plan (and group health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in [section 300gg–91(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91/c/2] if the benefits—

            (A) are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance; or

            (B) are otherwise not an integral part of the plan.

        (2) __Noncoordinated, excepted benefits__ 

        The requirements of subparts 1 and 2 1 shall not apply to any individual coverage or any group health plan (and group health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in [section 300gg–91(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91/c/3] if all of the following conditions are met:

            (A) The benefits are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.

            (B) There is no coordination between the provision of such benefits and any exclusion of benefits under any group health plan maintained by the same plan sponsor.

            (C) Such benefits are paid with respect to an event without regard to whether benefits are provided with respect to such an event under any group health plan maintained by the same plan sponsor or, with respect to individual coverage, under any health insurance coverage maintained by the same health insurance issuer.

        (3) __Supplemental excepted benefits__ 

            The requirements of this part shall not apply to any individual coverage or any group health plan (and group health insurance coverage) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in section 300gg–91(c)(4) 1 of this title if the benefits are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.

    (d) __Treatment of partnerships__ 

    For purposes of this part—

        (1) __Treatment as a group health plan__ 

            Any plan, fund, or program which would not be (but for this subsection) an employee welfare benefit plan and which is established or maintained by a partnership, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program provides medical care (including items and services paid for as medical care) to present or former partners in the partnership or to their dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan, fund, or program), directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise, shall be treated (subject to paragraph (2)) as an employee welfare benefit plan which is a group health plan.

        (2) __Employer__ 

            In the case of a group health plan, the term “employer” also includes the partnership in relation to any partner.

        (3) __Participants of group health plans__ 

        In the case of a group health plan, the term “participant” also includes—

            (A) in connection with a group health plan maintained by a partnership, an individual who is a partner in relation to the partnership, or

            (B) in connection with a group health plan maintained by a self-employed individual (under which one or more employees are participants), the self-employed individual,

            if such individual is, or may become, eligible to receive a benefit under the plan or such individual’s beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
