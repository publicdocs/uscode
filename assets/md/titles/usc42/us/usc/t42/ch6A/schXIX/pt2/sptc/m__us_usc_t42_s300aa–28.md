        (2) if a safety test on such batch, lot, or other quantity indicates a potential imminent or substantial public health hazard is presented, report to the Secretary within 24 hours of such safety test which the manufacturer (or manufacturer’s representative) conducted, including the date of the test, the type of vaccine tested, the identity of the batch, lot, or other quantity tested, whether the batch, lot, or other quantity tested is the product of repooling or reworking of previous batches, lots, or other quantities (and, if so, the identity of the previous batches, lots, or other quantities which were repooled or reworked), the complete test results, and the name and address of the person responsible for conducting the test,

        (3) include with each such report a certification signed by a responsible corporate official that such report is true and complete, and

        (4) prepare, maintain, and upon request submit to the Secretary product distribution records for each such vaccine by batch, lot, or other quantity number.

    (b) __Sanction__

        (1) be subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000 per occurrence, or
