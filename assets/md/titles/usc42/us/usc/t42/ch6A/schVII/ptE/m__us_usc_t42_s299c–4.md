## § 299c–4. Additional provisions with respect to grants and contracts

    (a) __Financial conflicts of interest__ 

    With respect to projects for which awards of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are authorized to be made under this subchapter, the Director shall by regulation define—

        (1) the specific circumstances that constitute financial interests in such projects that will, or may be reasonably expected to, create a bias in favor of obtaining results in the projects that are consistent with such interests; and

        (2) the actions that will be taken by the Director in response to any such interests identified by the Director.

    (b) __Requirement of application__ 

        The Director may not, with respect to any program under this subchapter authorizing the provision of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts, provide any such financial assistance unless an application for the assistance is submitted to the Secretary and the application is in such form, is made in such manner, and contains such agreements, assurances, and information as the Director determines to be necessary to carry out the program involved.

    (c) __Provision of supplies and services in lieu of funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Upon the request of an entity receiving a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under this subchapter, the Secretary may, subject to paragraph (2), provide supplies, equipment, and services for the purpose of aiding the entity in carrying out the project involved and, for such purpose, may detail to the entity any officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services.

        (2) __Corresponding reduction in funds__ 

            With respect to a request described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the financial assistance involved by an amount equal to the costs of detailing personnel and the fair market value of any supplies, equipment, or services provided by the Director. The Secretary shall, for the payment of expenses incurred in complying with such request, expend the amounts withheld.

    (d) __Applicability of certain provisions with respect to contracts__
