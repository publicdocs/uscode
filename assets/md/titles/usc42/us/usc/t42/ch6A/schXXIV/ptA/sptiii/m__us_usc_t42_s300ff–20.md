                 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2013, notwithstanding subsection (a)—

                    (I)

                     there shall be transferred to the State containing the metropolitan area, for purposes described in [section 300ff–22(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–22/a], an amount (which shall not be taken into account in applying [section 300ff–28(a)(2)(H) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–28/a/2/H]) equal to—

                        (aa) for the first fiscal year of the metropolitan area not being a transitional area, 75 percent of the amount described in subparagraph (A)(i) for such area;

        (3)

         If a metropolitan area is a transitional area under [section 300ff–19 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19] for a fiscal year, but for a subsequent fiscal year qualifies as an eligible area under subpart I—

            (A) the amount reserved under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section for the first such subsequent fiscal year of becoming an eligible area is deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant that, pursuant to [section 300ff–13(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–13/a], was made under [section 300ff–19(d)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19/d/2/A] for the metropolitan area for the preceding fiscal year; and

            (B) the amount reserved under subsection (b)(2)(A) for such fiscal year is deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the amount of the reduction under subparagraph (A) for such year.

        (2) The reductions shall be made before the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) are used for purposes of [section 300ff–13(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–13/a/4].

        (3) If the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) are not sufficient for making all the reductions, the reductions shall be reduced until the total amount of the reductions equals the total of the amounts referred to in such paragraph.

    (e) __Rules of construction regarding first subsequent fiscal year__ 

        Paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c) apply with respect to each series of fiscal years during which a metropolitan area is an eligible area under subpart I or a transitional area under [section 300ff–19 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19] for a fiscal year and then for a subsequent fiscal year ceases to be such an area by reason of section 300ff–11(b) or 300ff–19(c)(2) of this title, respectively, rather than applying to a single such series. Paragraph (3) of subsection (c) applies with respect to each series of fiscal years during which a metropolitan area is a transitional area under [section 300ff–19 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300ff–19] for a fiscal year and then for a subsequent fiscal year becomes an eligible area under subpart I, rather than applying to a single such series.
