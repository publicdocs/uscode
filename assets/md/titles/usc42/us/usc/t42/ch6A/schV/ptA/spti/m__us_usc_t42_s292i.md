        (2) __Funding__ 

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), all amounts received by the Secretary as premium charges for insurance and as receipts, earnings, or proceeds derived from any claim or other assets acquired by the Secretary in connection with his operations under this subpart, and any other moneys, property, or assets derived by the Secretary from the operations of the Secretary in connection with this section, shall be deposited in the Account.

            (B) With respect to amounts described in subparagraph (A) that are received by the Secretary for fiscal year 1993 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary may, before depositing such amounts in the Account, reserve from the amounts each such fiscal year not more than $1,000,000 for obligation under [section 292h(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s292h/d].

        (3) __Expenditures__ 

            All payments in connection with the default of loans insured by the Secretary under this subpart shall be paid from the Account.
