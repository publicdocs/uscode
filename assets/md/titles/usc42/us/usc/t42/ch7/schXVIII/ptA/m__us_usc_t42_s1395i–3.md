The State shall, after providing the individual involved with a written notice of the allegations (including a statement of the availability of a hearing for the individual to rebut the allegations) and the opportunity for a hearing on the record, make a written finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that a nurse aide has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the nurse aide and the registry of such finding. If the State finds that any other individual used by the facility has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the appropriate licensure authority.

                (ii) __Timing of determination__ 

                    In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under clause (i) be made prior to the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the name of the petitioner was added to the registry under subparagraph (C).

            (E) __Construction__ 

                The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.

        (2) __Surveys__ 

            (A) __Standard survey__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each skilled nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a skilled nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a]. The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for the scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.

                (ii) __Contents__ 

                Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents—

                    (I) a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,

                    (II) written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section and an audit of the residents’ assessments under subsection (b)(3) of this section to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and

                (iii) __Frequency__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Each skilled nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this subparagraph. The Statewide average interval between standard surveys of skilled nursing facilities under this subsection shall not exceed 12 months.

                    (II) __Special surveys__ 

                        If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a skilled nursing facility, or the director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.

            (B) __Extended surveys__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each skilled nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary’s or State’s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).

                (ii) __Timing__ 

                    The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).

                (iii) __Contents__ 

                    In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents’ assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.

                (iv) __Construction__ 

                    Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) of this section on the basis of findings in a standard survey.

            (C) __Survey protocol__ 

            Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted—

                (i) based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than January 1, 1990, and

                (ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.

                The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary’s responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.

            (D) __Consistency of surveys__ 

                Each State and the Secretary shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.

            (E) __Survey teams__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Surveys under this subsection shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (including a registered professional nurse).

                (ii) __Prohibition of conflicts of interest__ 

                    A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.

                (iii) __Training__ 

                    The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.

        (3) __Validation surveys__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the facility’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.

            (B) __Scope__ 

                With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of skilled nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 skilled nursing facilities in the State.

            (C) __Remedies for substandard performance__ 

                If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State’s survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate remedy, which may include the training of survey teams in the State.

            (D) __Special surveys of compliance__ 

                Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a skilled nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the skilled nursing facility meets such requirements.

        (4) __Investigation of complaints and monitoring compliance__ 

        Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to—

            (A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by skilled nursing facilities, and

            (B)

             monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a skilled nursing facility’s compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if—

                (i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;

                (ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or

                (iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.

            A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard skilled nursing facilities.

        (5) __Disclosure of results of inspections and activities__ 

            (A) __Public information__ 

            Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public—

                (i) information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting skilled nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,

                (ii) copies of cost reports of such facilities filed under this subchapter or subchapter XIX of this chapter,

                (iii) copies of statements of ownership under [section 1320a–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–3], and

                (iv) information disclosed under [section 1320a–5 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–5].

            (B) __Notice to ombudsman__ 

                Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 \[[42 U.S.C. 3021][/us/usc/t42/s3021] et seq., 3058 et seq.\] in accordance with section 712 of the Act \[[42 U.S.C. 3058g][/us/usc/t42/s3058g]\]) of the State’s findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or of any adverse action taken against a skilled nursing facility under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of subsection (h) of this section, with respect to a skilled nursing facility in the State.

            (C) __Notice to physicians and skilled nursing facility administrator licensing board__ 

            If a State finds that a skilled nursing facility has provided substandard quality of care, the State shall notify—

                (i) the attending physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made, and

                (ii) the State board responsible for the licensing of the skilled nursing facility administrator at the facility.

            (D) __Access to fraud control units__ 

                Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under [section 1396b(q) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/q]) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.

            (E) __Submission of survey and certification information to the Secretary__ 

                In order to improve the timeliness of information made available to the public under subparagraph (A) and provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website under subsection (i), each State shall submit information respecting any survey or certification made respecting a skilled nursing facility (including any enforcement actions taken by the State) to the Secretary not later than the date on which the State sends such information to the facility. The Secretary shall use the information submitted under the preceding sentence to update the information provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website as expeditiously as practicable but not less frequently than quarterly.

    (h) __Enforcement process__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a skilled nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—

            (A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall recommend to the Secretary that the Secretary take such action as described in paragraph (2)(A)(i); or

            (B) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may recommend to the Secretary that the Secretary take such action as described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii).

            If a State finds that a skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may recommend a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

        (2) __Secretarial authority__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            With respect to any skilled nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds, or pursuant to a recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—

                (i) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (B)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under this subchapter and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (B); or

                (ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (B).

                Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a skilled nursing facility’s deficiencies. If the Secretary finds, or pursuant to the recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (B)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

            (B) __Specified remedies__ 

            The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:

                (i) __Denial of payment__ 

                    The Secretary may deny any further payments under this subchapter with respect to all individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter in the facility or with respect to such individuals admitted to the facility after the effective date of the finding.

                (ii) __Authority with respect to civil money penalties__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Subject to subclause (II), the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a].

                    (II) __Reduction of civil money penalties in certain circumstances__ 

                        Subject to subclause (III), in the case where a facility self-reports and promptly corrects a deficiency for which a penalty was imposed under this clause not later than 10 calendar days after the date of such imposition, the Secretary may reduce the amount of the penalty imposed by not more than 50 percent.

                    (III) __Prohibitions on reduction for certain deficiencies__ 

                        (aa) __Repeat deficiencies__ 

                            The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the Secretary had reduced a penalty imposed on the facility in the preceding year under such subclause with respect to a repeat deficiency.

                        (bb) __Certain other deficiencies__ 

                            The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the penalty is imposed on the facility for a deficiency that is found to result in a pattern of harm or widespread harm, immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of a resident or residents of the facility, or results in the death of a resident of the facility.

                    (IV) __Collection of civil money penalties__ 

                    In the case of a civil money penalty imposed under this clause, the Secretary shall issue regulations that—

                        (aa) subject to item (cc), not later than 30 days after the imposition of the penalty, provide for the facility to have the opportunity to participate in an independent informal dispute resolution process which generates a written record prior to the collection of such penalty;

                        (bb) in the case where the penalty is imposed for each day of noncompliance, provide that a penalty may not be imposed for any day during the period beginning on the initial day of the imposition of the penalty and ending on the day on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed;

                        (cc) may provide for the collection of such civil money penalty and the placement of such amounts collected in an escrow account under the direction of the Secretary on the earlier of the date on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed or the date that is 90 days after the date of the imposition of the penalty;

                        (dd) may provide that such amounts collected are kept in such account pending the resolution of any subsequent appeals;

                        (ee) in the case where the facility successfully appeals the penalty, may provide for the return of such amounts collected (plus interest) to the facility; and

                        (ff) in the case where all such appeals are unsuccessful, may provide that some portion of such amounts collected may be used to support activities that benefit residents, including assistance to support and protect residents of a facility that closes (voluntarily or involuntarily) or is decertified (including offsetting costs of relocating residents to home and community-based settings or another facility), projects that support resident and family councils and other consumer involvement in assuring quality care in facilities, and facility improvement initiatives approved by the Secretary (including joint training of facility staff and surveyors, technical assistance for facilities implementing quality assurance programs, the appointment of temporary management firms, and other activities approved by the Secretary).

                (iii) __Appointment of temporary management__ 

                In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while—

                    (I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or

                    (II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                 The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.

            (C) __Continuation of payments pending remediation__ 

            The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the effective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a skilled nursing facility not in compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, if—

                (i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility,

                (ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and

                (iii) the facility agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.

                The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States under this subparagraph.

            (D) __Assuring prompt compliance__ 

                If a skilled nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the Secretary shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (B)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.

            (E) __Repeated noncompliance__ 

            In the case of a skilled nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the Secretary shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)—

                (i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (B)(i), and

                (ii) monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B) of this section,

                until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.

        (3) __Effective period of denial of payment__ 

            A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the Secretary finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

        (4) __Immediate termination of participation for facility where Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy__ 

            If the Secretary finds that a skilled nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iii), or the Secretary, subject to [section 1320a–7j(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7j/h], shall terminate the facility’s participation under this subchapter. If the facility’s participation under this subchapter is terminated, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under this subchapter consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) and [section 1320a–7j(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7j/h].

        (5) __Construction__ 

            The remedies provided under this subsection are in addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal law and shall not be construed as limiting such other remedies, including any remedy available to an individual at common law. The remedies described in clauses (i), (ii)(IV), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) may be imposed during the pendency of any hearing.

        (6) __Sharing of information__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all information concerning skilled nursing facilities required by this section to be filed with the Secretary or a State agency shall be made available by such facilities to Federal or State employees for purposes consistent with the effective administration of programs established under this subchapter and subchapter XIX of this chapter, including investigations by State medicaid fraud control units.
