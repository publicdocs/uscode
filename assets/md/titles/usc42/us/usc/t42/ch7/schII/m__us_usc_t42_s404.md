## § 404. Overpayments and underpayments

    (a) __Procedure for adjustment or recovery__ 

        (1)

         Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person under this subchapter, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, as follows:

            (A) With respect to payment to a person of more than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall decrease any payment under this subchapter to which such overpaid person is entitled, or shall require such overpaid person or his estate to refund the amount in excess of the correct amount, or shall decrease any payment under this subchapter payable to his estate or to any other person on the basis of the wages and self-employment income which were the basis of the payments to such overpaid person, or shall obtain recovery by means of reduction in tax refunds based on notice to the Secretary of the Treasury as permitted under [section 3720A of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3720A], or shall apply any combination of the foregoing. A payment made under this subchapter on the basis of an erroneous report of death by the Department of Defense of an individual in the line of duty while he is a member of the uniformed services (as defined in [section 410(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/m]) on active duty (as defined in section 410(l) of this title) shall not be considered an incorrect payment for any month prior to the month such Department notifies the Commissioner of Social Security that such individual is alive.

            (B)

                (i) Subject to clause (ii), with respect to payment to a person of less than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make payment of the balance of the amount due such underpaid person, or, if such person dies before payments are completed or before negotiating one or more checks representing correct payments, disposition of the amount due shall be made in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

                (ii)

                 No payment shall be made under this subparagraph to any person during any period for which monthly insurance benefits of such person—

                    (I) are subject to nonpayment by reason of [section 402(x)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/x/1], or

                    (II) in the case of a person whose monthly insurance benefits have terminated for a reason other than death, would be subject to nonpayment by reason of [section 402(x)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/x/1] but for the termination of such benefits,

                    until [section 402(x)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/x/1] no longer applies, or would no longer apply in the case of benefits that have terminated.

                (iii) Nothing in clause (ii) shall be construed to limit the Commissioner’s authority to withhold amounts, make adjustments, or recover amounts due under this subchapter, subchapter VIII or subchapter XVI that would be deducted from a payment that would otherwise be payable to such person but for such clause.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when any payment of more than the correct amount is made to or on behalf of an individual who has died, and such payment—

            (A) is made by direct deposit to a financial institution;

            (B) is credited by the financial institution to a joint account of the deceased individual and another person; and

            (C) such other person was entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as the deceased individual for the month preceding the month in which the deceased individual died,

            the amount of such payment in excess of the correct amount shall be treated as a payment of more than the correct amount to such other person. If any payment of more than the correct amount is made to a representative payee on behalf of an individual after the individual’s death, the representative payee shall be liable for the repayment of the overpayment, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish an overpayment control record under the social security account number of the representative payee.

    (b) __Access to financial information for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance waivers__ 

        (1) In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.

        (2) In making for purposes of this subsection any determination of whether any individual is without fault, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language).

        (3)

            (A) In making for purposes of this subsection any determination of whether such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall require an individual to provide authorization for the Commissioner to obtain (subject to the cost reimbursement requirements of section 1115(a) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3415][/us/usc/t12/s3415]\]) from any financial institution (within the meaning of section 1101(1) of such Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3401(1)][/us/usc/t12/s3401/1]\]) any financial record (within the meaning of section 1101(2) of such Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3401(2)][/us/usc/t12/s3401/2]\]) held by the institution with respect to such individual whenever the Commissioner determines the record is needed in connection with a determination with respect to such adjustment or recovery.

            (B)

             Notwithstanding section 1104(a)(1) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3404(a)(1)][/us/usc/t12/s3404/a/1]\], an authorization provided by an individual pursuant this paragraph shall remain effective until the earlier of—

                (i) the rendering of a final decision on whether adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter; or

                (ii) the express revocation by the individual of the authorization, in a written notification to the Commissioner.

            (C)

                (i) An authorization obtained by the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant this paragraph shall be considered to meet the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3401][/us/usc/t12/s3401] et seq.\] for purposes of section 1103(a) of such Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3403(a)][/us/usc/t12/s3403/a]\], and need not be furnished to the financial institution, notwithstanding section 1104(a) of such Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3404(a)][/us/usc/t12/s3404/a]\].

                (ii) The certification requirements of section 1103(b) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3403(b)][/us/usc/t12/s3403/b]\] shall not apply to requests by the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant to an authorization provided under this paragraph.

                (iii) A request by the Commissioner pursuant to an authorization provided under this paragraph is deemed to meet the requirements of section 1104(a)(3) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3404(a)(3)][/us/usc/t12/s3404/a/3]\] and the flush language of section 1102 of such Act \[[12 U.S.C. 3402][/us/usc/t12/s3402]\].

            (D) The Commissioner shall inform any person who provides authorization pursuant to this paragraph of the duration and scope of the authorization.

            (E) If an individual refuses to provide, or revokes, any authorization for the Commissioner of Social Security to obtain from any financial institution any financial record, the Commissioner may, on that basis, determine that adjustment or recovery would not defeat the purpose of this subchapter.

    (c) __Nonliability of certifying and disbursing officers__ 

        No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him to any person where the adjustment or recovery of such amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section, or where adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed prior to the death of all persons against whose benefits deductions are authorized.

    (d) __Payment to survivors or heirs when eligible person is deceased__ 

    If an individual dies before any payment due him under this subchapter is completed, payment of the amount due (including the amount of any unnegotiated checks) shall be made—

        (1) to the person, if any, who is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual and who either (i) was living in the same household with the deceased at the time of his death or (ii) was, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual;

        (2) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), or if the person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the child or children, if any, of the deceased individual who were, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to monthly benefits on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such child, in equal parts to each such child);

        (3) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the parent or parents, if any, of the deceased individual who were, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to monthly benefits on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such parent, in equal parts to each such parent);

        (4) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person, if any, determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual;

        (5) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person or persons, if any, determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the child or children of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such child, in equal parts to each such child);

        (6) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the parent or parents, if any, of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such parent, in equal parts to each such parent); or

        (7) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the legal representative of the estate of the deceased individual, if any.

    (e) __Adjustments due to supplemental security income payments__ 

        For payments which are adjusted by reason of payment of benefits under the supplemental security income program established by subchapter XVI of this chapter, see [section 1320a–6 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–6].

Probably should be “delinquent”. </sup></sup>  amount, the Commissioner of Social Security may use the collection practices described in sections 3711(f), 3716, 3717, and 3718 of title 31 and in [section 5514 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5514], all as in effect immediately after April 26, 1996.

        (2)

            (A) in excess of the correct amount of payment under this subchapter;

            (B) paid to a person after such person has attained 18 years of age; and

            (C) determined by the Commissioner of Social Security, under regulations, to be otherwise unrecoverable under this section after such person ceases to be a beneficiary under this subchapter.
