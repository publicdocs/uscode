            With respect to fee schedules established for each of 2016 through 2018, the following shall apply:

                (i) __Determination of net reduction in expenditures__ 

                    For each year, the Secretary shall determine the estimated net reduction in expenditures under the fee schedule under this section with respect to the year as a result of adjustments to the relative values established under this paragraph for misvalued codes.

                (ii) __Budget neutral redistribution of funds if target met and counting overages towards the target for the succeeding year__ 

                If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is equal to or greater than the target for the year—

                    (I) reduced expenditures attributable to such adjustments shall be redistributed for the year in a budget neutral manner in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii)(II); and

                    (II) the amount by which such reduced expenditures exceeds the target for the year shall be treated as a reduction in expenditures described in clause (i) for the succeeding year, for purposes of determining whether the target has or has not been met under this subparagraph with respect to that year.

                (iii) __Exemption from budget neutrality if target not met__ 

                    If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is less than the target for the year, reduced expenditures in an amount equal to the target recapture amount shall not be taken into account in applying subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) with respect to fee schedules beginning with 2016.

                (iv) __Target recapture amount__ 

                For purposes of clause (iii), the target recapture amount is, with respect to a year, an amount equal to the difference between—

                    (I) the target for the year; and

                    (II) the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year.

                (v) __Target__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, with respect to a year, the target is calculated as 0.5 percent (or, for 2016, 1.0 percent) of the estimated amount of expenditures under the fee schedule under this section for the year.

        (3) __Component percentages__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine a work percentage, a practice expense percentage, and a malpractice percentage for each physician’s service as follows:

            (A) __Division of services by specialty__ 

                For each physician’s service or class of physicians’ services, the Secretary shall determine the average percentage of each such service or class of services that is performed, nationwide, under this part by physicians in each of the different physician specialties (as identified by the Secretary).

            (B) __Division of specialty by component__ 

                The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians’ services. Such percentages shall be based on national data that describe the elements of physician practice costs and revenues, by physician specialty. The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine practice costs and revenues for specialties for which adequate data are not available.

            (C) __Determination of component percentages__ 

                (i) __Work percentage__ 

                The work percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of—

                    (I) the average percentage division for the work component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

                    (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

                (ii) __Practice expense percentage__ 

                For years before 2002, the practice expense percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of—

                    (I) the average percentage division for the practice expense component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

                    (II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

                (iii) __Malpractice percentage__ 

                For years before 1999, the malpractice percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of—

                    (I) the average percentage division for the malpractice component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Secretary shall not implement the policy established in the final rule published on November 13, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 67548 et seq.), that requires the transition of all 10-day and 90-day global surgery packages to 0-day global periods.

                (ii) __Construction__ 

                    Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from revaluing misvalued codes for specific surgical services or assigning values to new or revised codes for surgical services.

            (B) __Collection of data on services included in global surgical packages__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall through rulemaking develop and implement a process to gather, from a representative sample of physicians, beginning not later than January 1, 2017, information needed to value surgical services. Such information shall include the number and level of medical visits furnished during the global period and other items and services related to the surgery and furnished during the global period, as appropriate. Such information shall be reported on claims at the end of the global period or in another manner specified by the Secretary.

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The conversion factor for each year shall be the conversion factor established under this subsection for the previous year (or, in the case of 1992, specified in subparagraph (B)) adjusted by the update (established under paragraph (3)) for the year involved (for years before 2001) and, for years beginning with 2001 and ending with 2025, multiplied by the update (established under paragraph (4) or a subsequent paragraph) for the year involved. There shall be two separate conversion factors for each year beginning with 2026, one for items and services furnished by a qualifying APM participant (as defined in section 1395l(z)(2)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title) (referred to in this subsection as the “qualifying APM conversion factor”) and the other for other items and services (referred to in this subsection as the “nonqualifying APM conversion factor”), equal to the respective conversion factor for the previous year (or, in the case of 2026, equal to the single conversion factor for 2025) multiplied by the update established under paragraph (20) for such respective conversion factor for such year.

            (B) __Special provision for 1992__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conversion factor specified in this subparagraph is a conversion factor (determined by the Secretary) which, if this section were to apply during 1991 using such conversion factor, would result in the same aggregate amount of payments under this part for physicians’ services as the estimated aggregate amount of the payments under this part for such services in 1991.

            (C) __Special rules for 1998__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the single conversion factor for 1998 under this subsection shall be the conversion factor for primary care services for 1997, increased by the Secretary’s estimate of the weighted average of the three separate updates that would otherwise occur were it not for the enactment of chapter 1 of subtitle F of title IV of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

            (D) __Special rules for anesthesia services__ 

                The separate conversion factor for anesthesia services for a year shall be equal to 46 percent of the single conversion factor (or, beginning with 2026, applicable conversion factor) established for other physicians’ services, except as adjusted for changes in work, practice expense, or malpractice relative value units.

            (E) __Publication and dissemination of information__ 

            The Secretary shall—

                (i) cause to have published in the Federal Register not later than November 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) the conversion factor which will apply to physicians’ services for the succeeding year, the update determined under paragraph (4) for such succeeding year, and the allowed expenditures under such paragraph for such succeeding year; and

                (ii) make available to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the public by March 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) an estimate of the sustainable growth rate and of the conversion factor which will apply to physicians’ services for the succeeding year and data used in making such estimate.

                (ii) __For 2011__ 

                    Subject to clause (iii), for services furnished during 2011, the employee wage and rent portions of the practice expense geographic index described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall reflect ½ of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such employee wages and rents.

                (iii) __Hold harmless__ 

                    The practice expense portion of the geographic adjustment factor applied in a fee schedule area for services furnished in 2010 or 2011 shall not, as a result of the application of clause (i) or (ii), be reduced below the practice expense portion of the geographic adjustment factor under subparagraph (A)(i) (as calculated prior to the application of such clause (i) or (ii), respectively) for such area for such year.

                (iv) __Analysis__ 

                The Secretary shall analyze current methods of establishing practice expense geographic adjustments under subparagraph (A)(i) and evaluate data that fairly and reliably establishes distinctions in the costs of operating a medical practice in the different fee schedule areas. Such analysis shall include an evaluation of the following:

                    (I) The feasibility of using actual data or reliable survey data developed by medical organizations on the costs of operating a medical practice, including office rents and non-physician staff wages, in different fee schedule areas.

                    (II) The office expense portion of the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i), including the extent to which types of office expenses are determined in local markets instead of national markets.

                    (III) The weights assigned to each of the categories within the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i).

                (v) __Revision for 2012 and subsequent years__ 

                As a result of the analysis described in clause (iv), the Secretary shall, not later than January 1, 2012, make appropriate adjustments to the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i) to ensure accurate geographic adjustments across fee schedule areas, including—

        (6) __MIPS payments__ 

            (A) __MIPS adjustment factor__ 

            Taking into account paragraph (1)(G), the Secretary shall specify a MIPS adjustment factor for each MIPS eligible professional for a year. Such MIPS adjustment factor for a MIPS eligible professional for a year shall be in the form of a percent and shall be determined—

                (i) by comparing the composite performance score of the eligible professional for such year to the performance threshold established under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year;

                (ii)

                 in a manner such that the adjustment factors specified under this subparagraph for a year result in differential payments under this paragraph reflecting that—

                    (I) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year at or above such performance threshold for such year receive zero or positive payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iii), with such professionals having higher composite performance scores receiving higher adjustment factors; and

                    (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores for such year below such performance threshold for such year receive negative payment adjustment factors for such year in accordance with clause (iv), with such professionals having lower composite performance scores receiving lower adjustment factors;

                (iii) in a manner such that MIPS eligible professionals with composite scores described in clause (ii)(I) for such year, subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (F), receive a zero or positive adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 100; and

                (iv)

                 in a manner such that—

                    (I) subject to subclause (II), MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores described in clause (ii)(II) for such year receive a negative payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) is assigned for a score of 0; and

                    (II) MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores that are equal to or greater than 0, but not greater than ¼ of the performance threshold specified under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, receive a negative payment adjustment factor that is equal to the negative of the applicable percent specified in subparagraph (B) for such year.

            (B) __Applicable percent defined__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable percent” means—

                (i) for 2019, 4 percent;

                (ii) for 2020, 5 percent;

                (iii) for 2021, 7 percent; and

                (iv) for 2022 and subsequent years, 9 percent.

            (C) __Additional MIPS adjustment factors for exceptional performance__ 

                For 2019 and each subsequent year through 2024, in the case of a MIPS eligible professional with a composite performance score for a year at or above the additional performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(ii) for such year, in addition to the MIPS adjustment factor under subparagraph (A) for the eligible professional for such year, subject to subparagraph (F)(iv), the Secretary shall specify an additional positive MIPS adjustment factor for such professional and year. Such additional MIPS adjustment factors shall be in the form of a percent and determined by the Secretary in a manner such that professionals having higher composite performance scores above the additional performance threshold receive higher additional MIPS adjustment factors.

            (D) __Establishment of performance thresholds__ 

                (i) __Performance threshold__ 

                    For each year of the MIPS, the Secretary shall compute a performance threshold with respect to which the composite performance score of MIPS eligible professionals shall be compared for purposes of determining adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) that are positive, negative, and zero. Such performance threshold for a year shall be the mean or median (as selected by the Secretary) of the composite performance scores for all MIPS eligible professionals with respect to a prior period specified by the Secretary. The Secretary may reassess the selection of the mean or median under the previous sentence every 3 years.

                (ii) __Additional performance threshold for exceptional performance__ 

                In addition to the performance threshold under clause (i), for each year of the MIPS, the Secretary shall compute an additional performance threshold for purposes of determining the additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). For each such year, the Secretary shall apply either of the following methods for computing such additional performance threshold for such a year:

                    (I) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the range of possible composite performance scores above the performance threshold determined under clause (i).

                    (II) The threshold shall be the score that is equal to the 25th percentile of the actual composite performance scores for MIPS eligible professionals with composite performance scores at or above the performance threshold with respect to the prior period described in clause (i).

                (iii) __Special rule for initial 2 years__ 

                With respect to each of the first two years to which the MIPS applies, the Secretary shall, prior to the performance period for such years, establish a performance threshold for purposes of determining MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) and a threshold for purposes of determining additional MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (C). Each such performance threshold shall—

                    (I) be based on a period prior to such performance periods; and

                    (II)

                     take into account—

                        (aa) data available with respect to performance on measures and activities that may be used under the performance categories under subparagraph (2)(B); and

                        (bb) other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary.

            (E) __Application of MIPS adjustment factors__ 

            In the case of items and services furnished by a MIPS eligible professional during a year (beginning with 2019), the amount otherwise paid under this part with respect to such items and services and MIPS eligible professional for such year, shall be multiplied by—

                (i) 1, plus

                (ii)

                 the sum of—

                    (I) the MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (A) divided by 100, and

                    (II) as applicable, the additional MIPS adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (C) divided by 100.

            (F) __Aggregate application of MIPS adjustment factors__ 

                (i) __Application of scaling factor__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        With respect to positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) for eligible professionals whose composite performance score is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, subject to subclause (II), the Secretary shall increase or decrease such adjustment factors by a scaling factor in order to ensure that the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) is met.

                    (II) __Scaling factor limit__ 

                        In no case may the scaling factor applied under this clause exceed 3.0.

                        Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary shall ensure that the estimated amount described in subclause (II) for a year is equal to the estimated amount described in subclause (III) for such year.

                    (II) __Aggregate increases__ 

                        The amount described in this subclause is the estimated increase in the aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of positive MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) (after application of the scaling factor described in clause (i)) to MIPS eligible professionals whose composite performance score for a year is above the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year.

                    (III) __Aggregate decreases__ 

                        The amount described in this subclause is the estimated decrease in the aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of negative MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) to MIPS eligible professionals whose composite performance score for a year is below the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year.

                (iii) __Exceptions__ 

                    (I) In the case that all MIPS eligible professionals receive composite performance scores for a year that are below the performance threshold under subparagraph (D)(i) for such year, the negative MIPS adjustment factors under subparagraph (A) shall apply with respect to such MIPS eligible professionals and the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) and the additional adjustment factors under clause (iv) shall not apply for such year.

                    (II) In the case that, with respect to a year, the application of clause (i) results in a scaling factor equal to the maximum scaling factor specified in clause (i)(II), such scaling factor shall apply and the budget neutrality requirement of clause (ii) shall not apply for such year.

                (iv) __Additional incentive payment adjustments__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Subject to subclause (II), in specifying the MIPS additional adjustment factors under subparagraph (C) for each applicable MIPS eligible professional for a year, the Secretary shall ensure that the estimated aggregate increase in payments under this part resulting from the application of such additional adjustment factors for MIPS eligible professionals in a year shall be equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to $500,000,000 for each year beginning with 2019 and ending with 2024.

>     There is great need to test alternatives to Fee-For-Service reimbursement in the Medicare program. One option is the promotion and adoption of new models of care for physicians.
