                (ii) in the manner and through the written instrumentalities such organization deems appropriate, makes available information on its policies regarding such service to prospective enrollees before or during enrollment and to enrollees within 90 days after the date that the organization adopts a change in policy regarding such a counseling or referral service.

                Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect disclosure requirements under State law or under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \[[29 U.S.C. 1001][/us/usc/t29/s1001] et seq.\].

            (B) maintains a sufficient number, mix, and geographic distribution of providers of services.

        (6) __Protecting enrollees against liability for payment__ 

        Each medicaid managed care organization shall provide that an individual eligible for medical assistance under the State plan under this subchapter who is enrolled with the organization may not be held liable—

                    (I) there is an orderly termination or reorganization of the organization; or

                    (II) improvements are made to remedy the violations found under paragraph (1),

                 except that temporary management under this subparagraph may not be terminated until the State has determined that the medicaid managed care organization has the capability to ensure that the violations shall not recur.

            (C) Permitting individuals enrolled with the managed care entity to terminate enrollment without cause, and notifying such individuals of such right to terminate enrollment.

            In the case of a medicaid managed care organization which has repeatedly failed to meet the requirements of [section 1396b(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/m] and this section, the State shall (regardless of what other sanctions are provided) impose the sanctions described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2).

        (4) __Authority to terminate contract__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a managed care entity which has failed to meet the requirements of this part or a contract under section 1396b(m) or 1396d(t)(3) of this title, the State shall have the authority to terminate such contract with the entity and to enroll such entity’s enrollees with other managed care entities (or to permit such enrollees to receive medical assistance under the State plan under this subchapter other than through a managed care entity).

            (B) __Availability of hearing prior to termination of contract__

            (A) has an Indian enrolled with the entity; and

            (B) has an Indian health care provider that is participating as a primary care provider within the network of the entity,

            insofar as the Indian is otherwise eligible to receive services from such Indian health care provider and the Indian health care provider has the capacity to provide primary care services to such Indian, the contract with the entity under [section 1396b(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/m] or under [section 1396d(t)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/t/3] shall require, as a condition of receiving payment under such contract, that the Indian shall be allowed to choose such Indian health care provider as the Indian’s primary care provider under the entity.

        (2) __Assurance of payment to Indian health care providers for provision of covered services__ 

        Each contract with a managed care entity under [section 1396b(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/m] or under [section 1396d(t)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/t/3] shall require any such entity, as a condition of receiving payment under such contract, to satisfy the following requirements:

            (A) __Demonstration of access to Indian health care providers and application of alternative payment arrangements__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (C), to—

                (i) demonstrate that the number of Indian health care providers that are participating providers with respect to such entity are sufficient to ensure timely access to covered Medicaid managed care services for those Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers; and

                (ii) agree to pay Indian health care providers, whether such providers are participating or nonparticipating providers with respect to the entity, for covered Medicaid managed care services provided to those Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers at a rate equal to the rate negotiated between such entity and the provider involved or, if such a rate has not been negotiated, at a rate that is not less than the level and amount of payment which the entity would make for the services if the services were furnished by a participating provider which is not an Indian health care provider.

                The Secretary shall establish procedures for applying the requirements of clause (i) in States where there are no or few Indian health providers.

            (B) __Prompt payment__ 

                To agree to make prompt payment (consistent with rule for prompt payment of providers under [section 1396u–2(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–2/f]) to Indian health care providers that are participating providers with respect to such entity or, in the case of an entity to which subparagraph (A)(ii) or (C) applies, that the entity is required to pay in accordance with that subparagraph.

                        To agree to pay any Indian health care provider that is a federally-qualified health center under this subchapter but not a participating provider with respect to the entity, for the provision of covered Medicaid managed care services by such provider to an Indian enrollee of the entity at a rate equal to the amount of payment that the entity would pay a federally-qualified health center that is a participating provider with respect to the entity but is not an Indian health care provider for such services.

                    (II) __Continued application of State requirement to make supplemental payment__ 

                        Nothing in subclause (I) or subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be construed as waiving the application of [section 1396a(bb)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/bb/5] regarding the State plan requirement to make any supplemental payment due under such section to a federally-qualified health center for services furnished by such center to an enrollee of a managed care entity (regardless of whether the federally-qualified health center is or is not a participating provider with the entity).

                (ii) __Payment rate for services provided by certain Indian health care providers__ 

                    If the amount paid by a managed care entity to an Indian health care provider that is not a federally-qualified health center for services provided by the provider to an Indian enrollee with the managed care entity is less than the rate that applies to the provision of such services by the provider under the State plan, the plan shall provide for payment to the Indian health care provider, whether the provider is a participating or nonparticipating provider with respect to the entity, of the difference between such applicable rate and the amount paid by the managed care entity to the provider for such services.

            (D) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as waiving the application of [section 1396a(a)(30)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/30/A] (relating to application of standards to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care).

        (3) __Special rule for enrollment for Indian managed care entities__ 

            Regarding the application of a Medicaid managed care program to Indian Medicaid managed care entities, an Indian Medicaid managed care entity may restrict enrollment under such program to Indians in the same manner as Indian Health Programs may restrict the delivery of services to Indians.
