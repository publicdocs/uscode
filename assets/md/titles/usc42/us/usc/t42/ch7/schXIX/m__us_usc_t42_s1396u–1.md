## § 1396u–1. Assuring coverage for certain low-income families

    (a) __References to subchapter IV–A are references to pre-welfare-reform provisions__ 

        Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, with respect to a State any reference in this subchapter (or any other provision of law in relation to the operation of this subchapter) to a provision of part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, or a State plan under such part (or a provision of such a plan), including income and resource standards and income and resource methodologies under such part or plan, shall be considered a reference to such a provision or plan as in effect as of July 16, 1996, with respect to the State.

    (b) __Application of pre-welfare-reform eligibility criteria__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this subchapter, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in determining eligibility for medical assistance—

            (A)

             an individual shall be treated as receiving aid or assistance under a State plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter only if the individual meets—

                (i) the income and resource standards for determining eligibility under such plan, and

                (ii) the eligibility requirements of such plan under subsections (a) through (c) of [section 606 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s606] and [section 607(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s607/a],

                as in effect as of July 16, 1996; and

            (B) the income and resource methodologies under such plan as of such date shall be used in the determination of whether any individual meets income and resource standards under such plan.

        (2) __State option__ 

        For purposes of applying this section, a State—

            (A) may lower its income standards applicable with respect to part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, but not below the income standards applicable under its State plan under such part on May 1, 1988;

            (B) may increase income or resource standards under the State plan referred to in paragraph (1) over a period (beginning after July 16, 1996) by a percentage that does not exceed the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) over such period; and

            (C) may use income and resource methodologies that are less restrictive than the methodologies used under the State plan under such part as of July 16, 1996.

        (3) __Option to terminate medical assistance for failure to meet work requirement__ 

            (A) __Individuals receiving cash assistance under TANF__ 

            In the case of an individual who—

                (i) is receiving cash assistance under a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter,

                (ii) is eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter on a basis not related to section 1396a(l) of this title, and

                (iii) has the cash assistance under such program terminated pursuant to [section 607(e)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s607/e/1/B] (as in effect on or after the welfare reform effective date) because of refusing to work,

                the State may terminate such individual’s eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter until such time as there no longer is a basis for the termination of such cash assistance because of such refusal.

            (B) __Exception for children__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as permitting a State to terminate medical assistance for a minor child who is not the head of a household receiving assistance under a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

    (c) __Treatment for purposes of transitional coverage provisions__ 

        (1) __Transition in the case of child support collections__ 

            The provisions of [section 606(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s606/h] (as in effect on July 16, 1996) shall apply, in relation to this subchapter, with respect to individuals (and families composed of individuals) who are described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, in the same manner as they applied before such date with respect to individuals who became ineligible for aid to families with dependent children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection of child or spousal support under part D of subchapter IV of this chapter.

        (2) __Transition in the case of earnings from employment__ 

            For continued medical assistance in the case of individuals (and families composed of individuals) described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section who would otherwise become ineligible because of hours or income from employment, see sections 1396r–6 and 1396a(e)(1) of this title.

    (d) __Waivers__ 

        In the case of a waiver of a provision of part A of subchapter IV of this chapter in effect with respect to a State as of July 16, 1996, or which is submitted to the Secretary before August 22, 1996, and approved by the Secretary on or before July 1, 1997, if the waiver affects eligibility of individuals for medical assistance under this subchapter, such waiver may (but need not) continue to be applied, at the option of the State, in relation to this subchapter after the date the waiver would otherwise expire.

    (e) __State option to use 1 application form__ 

        Nothing in this section, or part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, shall be construed as preventing a State from providing for the same application form for assistance under a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter (on or after the welfare reform effective date) and for medical assistance under this subchapter.

    (f) __Additional rules of construction__ 

        (1) With respect to the reference in [section 1396a(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/5] to a State plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, a State may treat such reference as a reference either to a State program funded under such part (as in effect on and after the welfare reform effective date) or to the State plan under this subchapter.

        (2) Any reference in [section 1396a(a)(55) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/55] to a State plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter shall be deemed a reference to a State program funded under such part.

        (3) In applying [section 1396b(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/f], the applicable income limitation otherwise determined shall be subject to increase in the same manner as income or resource standards of a State may be increased under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section.

    (g) __Relation to other provisions__ 

        The provisions of this section shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.

    (h) __Transitional increased Federal matching rate for increased administrative costs__

        (2) __Administrative expenditures described__ 

            The administrative expenditures described in this paragraph are expenditures described in [section 1396b(a)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/7] that a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary are attributable to administrative costs of eligibility determinations that (but for the enactment of this section) would not be incurred.

        (3) __Limitation__ 

            The total amount of additional Federal funds that are expended as a result of the application of this subsection for the period beginning with fiscal year 1997 shall not exceed $500,000,000.
