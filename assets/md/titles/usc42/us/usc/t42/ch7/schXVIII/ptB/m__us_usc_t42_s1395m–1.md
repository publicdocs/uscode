            In this section, the term “applicable laboratory” means a laboratory that, with respect to its revenues under this subchapter, a majority of such revenues are from this section, section 1395l(h) of this title, or [section 1395w–4 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–4]. The Secretary may establish a low volume or low expenditure threshold for excluding a laboratory from the definition of applicable laboratory under this paragraph, as the Secretary determines appropriate.

        (3) __Applicable information defined__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In this section, subject to subparagraph (B), the term “applicable information” means, with respect to a laboratory test for a data collection period, the following:

                (i) The payment rate (as determined in accordance with paragraph (5)) that was paid by each private payor for the test during the period.

                (ii) The volume of such tests for each such payor for the period.

            (B) __Exception for certain contractual arrangements__ 

                Such term shall not include information with respect to a laboratory test for which payment is made on a capitated basis or other similar payment basis during the data collection period.

        (4) __Data collection period defined__ 

            In this section, the term “data collection period” means a period of time, such as a previous 12 month period, specified by the Secretary.

        (5) __Treatment of discounts__ 

            The payment rate reported by a laboratory under this subsection shall reflect all discounts, rebates, coupons, and other price concessions, including those described in [section 1395w–3a(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3a/c/3].

        (6) __Ensuring complete reporting__ 

            In the case where an applicable laboratory has more than one payment rate for the same payor for the same test or more than one payment rate for different payors for the same test, the applicable laboratory shall report each such payment rate and the volume for the test at each such rate under this subsection. Beginning with January 1, 2019, the Secretary may establish rules to aggregate reporting with respect to the situations described in the preceding sentence.

        (7) __Certification__ 

            An officer of the laboratory shall certify the accuracy and completeness of the information reported under this subsection.

        (8) __Private payor defined__ 

        In this section, the term “private payor” means the following:

            (A) A health insurance issuer and a group health plan (as such terms are defined in [section 300gg–91 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91]).

            (B) A Medicare Advantage plan under part C of this subchapter.
