    (a) __General background and description__ 

    A State child health plan shall include a description, consistent with the requirements of this subchapter, of—

        (2) current State efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uncovered children, including the steps the State is taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs and health insurance programs that involve public-private partnerships;

        (3) how the plan is designed to be coordinated with such efforts to increase coverage of children under creditable health coverage;

        (4) the child health assistance provided under the plan for targeted low-income children, including the proposed methods of delivery, and utilization control systems;

        (5) eligibility standards consistent with subsection (b) of this section;

        (6) outreach activities consistent with subsection (c) of this section; and

        (7)

            (C) to ensure that the State agency involved is in compliance with subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of [section 1320a–7n(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7n/b/2].

    (b) __General description of eligibility standards and methodology__ 

        (1) __Eligibility standards__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The plan shall include a description of the standards used to determine the eligibility of targeted low-income children for child health assistance under the plan. Such standards may include (to the extent consistent with this subchapter) those relating to the geographic areas to be served by the plan, age, income and resources (including any standards relating to spenddowns and disposition of resources), residency, disability status (so long as any standard relating to such status does not restrict eligibility), access to or coverage under other health coverage, and duration of eligibility. Such standards may not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis.

            (B) __Limitations on eligibility standards__ 

            Such eligibility standards—

                (i) shall, within any defined group of covered targeted low-income children, not cover such children with higher family income without covering children with a lower family income;

                (ii) may not deny eligibility based on a child having a preexisting medical condition;

                (iii) may not apply a waiting period (including a waiting period to carry out paragraph (3)(C)) in the case of a targeted low-income pregnant woman provided pregnancy-related assistance under section 1397ll of this title;

                (iv) at State option, may not apply a waiting period in the case of a child provided dental-only supplemental coverage under [section 1397jj(b)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397jj/b/5]; and

                (v) shall, beginning January 1, 2014, use modified adjusted gross income and household income (as defined in section 36B(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) to determine eligibility for child health assistance under the State child health plan or under any waiver of such plan and for any other purpose applicable under the plan or waiver for which a determination of income is required, including with respect to the imposition of premiums and cost-sharing, consistent with [section 1396a(e)(14) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/e/14].

        (2) __Methodology__ 

            The plan shall include a description of methods of establishing and continuing eligibility and enrollment.

        (3) __Eligibility screening; coordination with other health coverage programs__ 

        The plan shall include a description of procedures to be used to ensure—

            (A) through both intake and followup screening, that only targeted low-income children are furnished child health assistance under the State child health plan;

            (B) that children found through the screening to be eligible for medical assistance under the State medicaid plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter are enrolled for such assistance under such plan;

            (C) that the insurance provided under the State child health plan does not substitute for coverage under group health plans;

            (D) the provision of child health assistance to targeted low-income children in the State who are Indians (as defined in section 1603(c)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 25); and

            (E) coordination with other public and private programs providing creditable coverage for low-income children.

        (4) __Reduction of administrative barriers to enrollment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the plan shall include a description of the procedures used to reduce administrative barriers to the enrollment of children and pregnant women who are eligible for medical assistance under subchapter XIX or for child health assistance or health benefits coverage under this subchapter. Such procedures shall be established and revised as often as the State determines appropriate to take into account the most recent information available to the State identifying such barriers.

            (B) __Deemed compliance if joint application and renewal process that permits application other than in person__ 

                A State shall be deemed to comply with subparagraph (A) if the State’s application and renewal forms and supplemental forms (if any) and information verification process is the same for purposes of establishing and renewing eligibility for children and pregnant women for medical assistance under subchapter XIX and child health assistance under this subchapter, and such process does not require an application to be made in person or a face-to-face interview.

        (5) __Nonentitlement__ 

            Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as providing an individual with an entitlement to child health assistance under a State child health plan.

    (c) __Outreach and coordination__ 

    A State child health plan shall include a description of the procedures to be used by the State to accomplish the following:

        (1) __Outreach__ 

            Outreach (through community health workers and others) to families of children likely to be eligible for child health assistance under the plan or under other public or private health coverage programs to inform these families of the availability of, and to assist them in enrolling their children in, such a program.

        (2) __Coordination with other health insurance programs__ 

            Coordination of the administration of the State program under this subchapter with other public and private health insurance programs.

        (3) __Premium assistance subsidies__ 

            In the case of a State that provides for premium assistance subsidies under the State child health plan in accordance with paragraph (2)(B), (3), or (10) of [section 1397ee(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397ee/c], or a waiver approved under [section 1315 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1315], outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for families of children likely to be eligible for such subsidies, to inform such families of the availability of, and to assist them in enrolling their children in, such subsidies, and for employers likely to provide coverage that is eligible for such subsidies, including the specific, significant resources the State intends to apply to educate employers about the availability of premium assistance subsidies under the State child health plan.
