    (b) __Quarterly estimates of State’s entitlement for next quarter; payments; United States’ pro rata share of amounts recovered as overpayment; allowance, disallowance, or deferral of claim__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall, prior to the beginning of each quarter, estimate the amount to which a State will be entitled under subsection (a) of this section for such quarter, such estimates to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if such amount is less than the State’s proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, (B) records showing the number of children in the State receiving assistance under this part, and (C) such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary.

        (2) The Secretary shall then pay to the State, in such installments as he may determine, the amounts so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayment or underpayment which the Secretary determines was made under this section to such State for any prior quarter and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection.

        (3) The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to foster care and adoption assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.

        (4)

            (A) Within 60 days after receipt of a State claim for expenditures pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allow, disallow, or defer such claim.

            (B) Within 15 days after a decision to defer such a State claim, the Secretary shall notify the State of the reasons for the deferral and of the additional information necessary to determine the allowability of the claim.

            (C)

                (i) disallow the claim, if able to complete the review and determine that the claim is not allowable, or

                (ii)

                 in any other case, allow the claim, subject to disallowance (as necessary)—

                    (I) upon completion of the review, if it is determined that the claim is not allowable; or

                    (II) on the basis of findings of an audit or financial management review.

    (c) __Automated data collection expenditures__ 

        The Secretary shall treat as necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan all expenditures of a State necessary in order for the State to plan, design, develop, install, and operate data collection and information retrieval systems described in subsection (a)(3)(C) of this section, without regard to whether the systems may be used with respect to foster or adoptive children other than those on behalf of whom foster care maintenance payments or adoption assistance payments may be made under this part.

    (d) __Reduction for violation of plan requirement__ 

        (1)

         If, during any quarter of a fiscal year, a State’s program operated under this part is found, as a result of a review conducted under [section 1320a–2a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–2a], or otherwise, to have violated paragraph (18) or (23) of [section 671(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671/a] with respect to a person or to have failed to implement a corrective action plan within a period of time not to exceed 6 months with respect to such violation, then, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations promulgated under [section 1320a–2a(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–2a/b/3], the Secretary shall reduce the amount otherwise payable to the State under this part, for that fiscal year quarter and for any subsequent quarter of such fiscal year, until the State program is found, as a result of a subsequent review under [section 1320a–2a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–2a], to have implemented a corrective action plan with respect to such violation, by—

            (A) 2 percent of such otherwise payable amount, in the case of the 1st such finding for the fiscal year with respect to the State;

            (B) 3 percent of such otherwise payable amount, in the case of the 2nd such finding for the fiscal year with respect to the State; or

            (C) 5 percent of such otherwise payable amount, in the case of the 3rd or subsequent such finding for the fiscal year with respect to the State.

            In imposing the penalties described in this paragraph, the Secretary shall not reduce any fiscal year payment to a State by more than 5 percent.

        (2) Any other entity which is in a State that receives funds under this part and which violates paragraph (18) or (23) of [section 671(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671/a] during a fiscal year quarter with respect to any person shall remit to the Secretary all funds that were paid by the State to the entity during the quarter from such funds.

        (3)

            (A) Any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of [section 671(a)(18) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671/a/18] by a State or other entity may bring an action seeking relief from the State or other entity in any United States district court.

            (B) An action under this paragraph may not be brought more than 2 years after the date the alleged violation occurred.

        (4) This subsection shall not be construed to affect the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 \[[25 U.S.C. 1901][/us/usc/t25/s1901] et seq.\].

    (e) __Discretionary grants for educational and training vouchers for youths aging out of foster care__ 

    From amounts appropriated pursuant to [section 677(h)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s677/h/2], the Secretary may make a grant to a State with a plan approved under this part, for a calendar quarter, in an amount equal to the lesser of—

        (1) 80 percent of the amounts expended by the State during the quarter to carry out programs for the purposes described in [section 677(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s677/a/6]; or

        (2) the amount, if any, allotted to the State under [section 677(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s677/c/3] for the fiscal year in which the quarter occurs, reduced by the total of the amounts payable to the State under this subsection for such purposes for all prior quarters in the fiscal year.

    (f) __Reduction for failure to submit required data__ 

        (1) If the Secretary finds that a State has failed to submit to the Secretary data, as required by regulation, for the data collection system implemented under [section 679 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s679], the Secretary shall, within 30 days after the date by which the data was due to be so submitted, notify the State of the failure and that payments to the State under this part will be reduced if the State fails to submit the data, as so required, within 6 months after the date the data was originally due to be so submitted.

        (2)

         If the Secretary finds that the State has failed to submit the data, as so required, by the end of the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, then, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations promulgated under [section 1320a–2a(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–2a/b/3], the Secretary shall reduce the amounts otherwise payable to the State under this part, for each quarter ending in the 6-month period (and each quarter ending in each subsequent consecutively occurring 6-month period until the Secretary finds that the State has submitted the data, as so required), by—

            (A) ⅙ of 1 percent of the total amount expended by the State for administration of foster care activities under the State plan approved under this part in the quarter so ending, in the case of the 1st 6-month period during which the failure continues; or

            (B) ¼ of 1 percent of the total amount so expended, in the case of the 2nd or any subsequent such 6-month period.

    (g) __Continued services under waiver__ 

        For purposes of this part, after the termination of a demonstration project relating to guardianship conducted by a State under [section 1320a–9 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–9], the expenditures of the State for the provision, to children who, as of September 30, 2008, were receiving assistance or services under the project, of the same assistance and services under the same terms and conditions that applied during the conduct of the project, are deemed to be expenditures under the State plan approved under this part.
