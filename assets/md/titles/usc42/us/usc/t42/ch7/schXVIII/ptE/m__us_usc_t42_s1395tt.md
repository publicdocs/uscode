## § 1395tt. Hospital providers of extended care services

    (a) __Hospital facility agreements; reasonable costs of services__ 

        (1) Any hospital which has an agreement under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc] may (subject to subsection (b) of this section) enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which its inpatient hospital facilities may be used for the furnishing of services of the type which, if furnished by a skilled nursing facility, would constitute extended care services.

        (2)

            (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payment to any hospital (other than a critical access hospital) for services furnished under an agreement entered into under this section shall be based upon the reasonable cost of the services as determined under subparagraph (B).

            (B)

                (i) The reasonable cost of the services consists of the reasonable cost of routine services (determined under clause (ii)) and the reasonable cost of ancillary services (determined under clause (iii)).

                (ii)

                 The reasonable cost of routine services furnished during any calendar year by a hospital under an agreement under this section is equal to the product of—

                    (I) the number of patient-days during the year for which the services were furnished, and

                    (II) the average reasonable cost per patient-day, such average reasonable cost per patient-day being the average rate per patient-day paid for routine services during the most recent year for which cost reporting data are available with respect to such services (increased in a compounded manner by the applicable increase for payments for routine service costs of skilled nursing facilities under subsections (a) through (d) of [section 1395yy of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395yy] for subsequent cost reporting periods and up to and including such calendar year) under this subchapter to freestanding skilled nursing facilities in the region (as defined in [section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/d/2/D]) in which the facility is located.

                (iii) The reasonable cost of ancillary services shall be determined in the same manner as the reasonable cost of ancillary services provided for inpatient hospital services.

        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, a critical access hospital shall be paid for covered skilled nursing facility services furnished under an agreement entered into under this section on the basis of equal to 101 percent of the reasonable costs of such services (as determined under [section 1395x(v) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/v]).

    (b) __Eligible facilities__ 

        The Secretary may not enter into an agreement under this section with any hospital unless, except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, the hospital is located in a rural area and has less than 100 beds.

    (c) __Terms and conditions of facility agreements__ 

        An agreement with a hospital under this section shall, except as otherwise provided under regulations of the Secretary, be of the same duration and subject to termination on the same conditions as are agreements with skilled nursing facilities under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc] and shall, where not inconsistent with any provision of this section, impose the same duties, responsibilities, conditions, and limitations, as those imposed under such agreements entered into under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc]; except that no such agreement with any hospital shall be in effect for any period during which the hospital does not have in effect an agreement under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc]. A hospital with respect to which an agreement under this section has been terminated shall not be eligible to enter into a new agreement until a two-year period has elapsed from the termination date.

    (d) __Post-hospital extended care services__ 

        Any agreement with a hospital under this section shall provide that payment for services will be made only for services for which payment would be made as post-hospital extended care services if those services had been furnished by a skilled nursing facility under an agreement entered into under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc]; and any individual who is furnished services, for which payment may be made under an agreement under this section, shall, for purposes of this subchapter (other than this section), be deemed to have received post-hospital extended care services in like manner and to the same extent as if the services furnished to him had been post-hospital extended care services furnished by a skilled nursing facility under an agreement under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc].

    (e) __Reimbursement for routine hospital services__ 

        During a period for which a hospital has in effect an agreement under this section, in order to allocate routine costs between hospital and long-term care services for purposes of determining payment for inpatient hospital services, the total reimbursement due for routine services from all classes of long-term care patients (including this subchapter, subchapter XIX of this chapter, and private pay patients) shall be subtracted from the hospital’s total routine costs before calculations are made to determine this subchapter reimbursement for routine hospital services.

    (f) __Conditions applicable to skilled nursing facilities__ 

        A hospital which enters into an agreement with the Secretary under this section shall be required to meet those conditions applicable to skilled nursing facilities relating to discharge planning and the social services function (and staffing requirements to satisfy it) which are promulgated by the Secretary under [section 1395i–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395i–3]. Services furnished by such a hospital which would otherwise constitute post-hospital extended care services if furnished by a skilled nursing facility shall be subject to the same requirements applicable to such services when furnished by a skilled nursing facility except for those requirements the Secretary determines are inappropriate in the case of these services being furnished by a hospital under this section.

    (g) __Agreements on demonstration basis__ 

        The Secretary may enter into an agreement under this section on a demonstration basis with any hospital which does not meet the requirement of subsection (b)(1) of this section, if the hospital otherwise meets the requirements of this section.
