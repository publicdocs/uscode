        (3) __Conditions for State eligibility__ 

        For purposes of a new demonstration project under this section that is initially approved in any of fiscal years 2012 through 2014, a State shall be authorized to conduct such demonstration project only if the State satisfies the following conditions:

            (A) __Identify 1 or more goals__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The State shall demonstrate that the demonstration project is designed to accomplish 1 or more of the following goals:

                    (I) Increase permanency for all infants, children, and youth by reducing the time in foster placements when possible and promoting a successful transition to adulthood for older youth.

                    (II) Increase positive outcomes for infants, children, youth, and families in their homes and communities, including tribal communities, and improve the safety and well-being of infants, children, and youth.

                    (III) Prevent child abuse and neglect and the re-entry of infants, children, and youth into foster care.

                (ii) __Long-term therapeutic family treatment centers; addressing domestic violence__ 

                With respect to a demonstration project that is designed to accomplish 1 or more of the goals described in clause (i), the State may elect to establish a program—

                    (I) to permit foster care maintenance payments to be made under part E of subchapter IV to a long-term therapeutic family treatment center (as described in paragraph (8)(B)) on behalf of a child residing in the center; or

                    (II) to identify and address domestic violence that endangers children and results in the placement of children in foster care.

            (B) __Demonstrate readiness__ 

                The State shall demonstrate through a narrative description the State’s capacity to effectively use the authority to conduct a demonstration project under this section by identifying changes the State has made or plans to make in policies, procedures, or other elements of the State’s child welfare program that will enable the State to successfully achieve the goal or goals of the project.

            (C) __Demonstrate implemented or planned child welfare program improvement policies__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The State shall demonstrate that the State has implemented, or plans to implement within 3 years of the date on which the State submits its application to conduct the demonstration project or 2 years after the date on which the Secretary approves such demonstration project (whichever is later), at least 2 of the child welfare program improvement policies described in paragraph (7).

                (ii) __Previous implementation__ 

                    For purposes of the requirement described in clause (i), at least 1 of the child welfare program improvement policies to be implemented by the State shall be a policy that the State has not previously implemented as of the date on which the State submits an application to conduct the demonstration project.

                (iii) __Implementation review__ 

                    The Secretary may terminate the authority of a State to conduct a demonstration project under this section if, after the 3-year period following approval of the demonstration project, the State has not made significant progress in implementing the child welfare program improvement policies proposed by the State under clause (i).

        (4) __Limitation on eligibility__ 

            The Secretary may not authorize a State to conduct a demonstration project under this section if the State fails to provide health insurance coverage to any child with special needs (as determined under [section 673(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s673/c]) for whom there is in effect an adoption assistance agreement between a State and an adoptive parent or parents.

        (5) __Requirement to consider effect of project on terms and conditions of certain court orders__ 

            In considering an application to conduct a demonstration project under this section that has been submitted by a State in which there is in effect a court order determining that the State’s child welfare program has failed to comply with the provisions of part B or E of subchapter IV of this chapter, or with the Constitution of the United States, the Secretary shall take into consideration the effect of approving the proposed project on the terms and conditions of the court order related to the failure to comply and the ability of the State to implement a corrective action plan approved under [section 1320a–2a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–2a].

        (6) __Inapplicability of random assignment for control groups as a factor for approval of demonstration projects__

        For purposes of paragraph (3)(C), the child welfare program improvement policies described in this paragraph are the following:

            (B) The development and implementation of a plan for meeting the health and mental health needs of infants, children, and youth in foster care that includes ensuring that the provision of health and mental health care is child-specific, comprehensive, appropriate, and consistent (through means such as ensuring the infant, child, or youth has a medical home, regular wellness medical visits, and addressing the issue of trauma, when appropriate).

            (C) The inclusion in the State plan under [section 671 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671] of an amendment implementing the option under subsection (a)(28) of that section to enter into kinship guardianship assistance agreements.

Supports for foster families under such a plan may include increasing maintenance payments to more adequately meet the needs of infants, children, and youth in foster care and expanding training, respite care, and other support services for foster parents.

            (H) The establishment of procedures designed to assist youth as they prepare for their transition out of foster care, such as arranging for participation in age-appropriate extra-curricular activities, providing appropriate access to cell phones, computers, and opportunities to obtain a driver’s license, providing notification of all sibling placements if siblings are in care and sibling location if siblings are out of care, and providing counseling and financial support for post-secondary education.

            (I)

             The inclusion in the State plan under [section 671 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671] of a description of State procedures for—
