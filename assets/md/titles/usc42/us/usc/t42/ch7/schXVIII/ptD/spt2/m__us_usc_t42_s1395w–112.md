## § 1395w–112. Requirements for and contracts with prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors

    (a) __General requirements__ 

    Each PDP sponsor of a prescription drug plan shall meet the following requirements:

        (1) __Licensure__ 

            Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the sponsor is organized and licensed under State law as a risk-bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers a prescription drug plan.

        (2) __Assumption of financial risk for unsubsidized coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), to the extent that the entity is at risk the entity assumes financial risk on a prospective basis for benefits that it offers under a prescription drug plan and that is not covered under [section 1395w–115(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–115/b].

            (B) __Reinsurance permitted__ 

                The plan sponsor may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of coverage provided to any enrollee to the extent that the sponsor is at risk for providing such coverage.

        (3) __Solvency for unlicensed sponsors__ 

            In the case of a PDP sponsor that is not described in paragraph (1) and for which a waiver has been approved under subsection (c) of this section, such sponsor shall meet solvency standards established by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section.

    (b) __Contract requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall not permit the enrollment under [section 1395w–101 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–101] in a prescription drug plan offered by a PDP sponsor under this part, and the sponsor shall not be eligible for payments under section 1395w–114 or 1395w–115 of this title, unless the Secretary has entered into a contract under this subsection with the sponsor with respect to the offering of such plan. Such a contract with a sponsor may cover more than one prescription drug plan. Such contract shall provide that the sponsor agrees to comply with the applicable requirements and standards of this part and the terms and conditions of payment as provided for in this part.

        (2) __Limitation on entities offering fallback prescription drug plans__ 

        The Secretary shall not enter into a contract with a PDP sponsor for the offering of a prescription drug plan (other than a fallback prescription drug plan) in a PDP region for a year if the sponsor—

            (A) submitted a bid under [section 1395w–111(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–111/g] for such year (as the first year of a contract period under such section) to offer a fallback prescription drug plan in any PDP region;

            (B) offers a fallback prescription drug plan in any PDP region during the year; or

            (C) offered a fallback prescription drug plan in that PDP region during the previous year.

            For purposes of this paragraph, an entity shall be treated as submitting a bid with respect to a prescription drug plan or offering a fallback prescription drug plan if the entity is acting as a subcontractor of a PDP sponsor that is offering such a plan. The previous sentence shall not apply to entities that are subcontractors of an MA organization except insofar as such organization is acting as a PDP sponsor with respect to a prescription drug plan.

        (3) __Incorporation of certain medicare advantage contract requirements__ 

        Except as otherwise provided, the following provisions of [section 1395w–27 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27] shall apply to contracts under this section in the same manner as they apply to contracts under [section 1395w–27(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/a]:

            (A) __Minimum enrollment__ 

            Paragraphs (1) and (3) of [section 1395w–27(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/b], except that—

                (i) the Secretary may increase the minimum number of enrollees required under such paragraph (1) as the Secretary determines appropriate; and

                (ii) the requirement of such paragraph (1) shall be waived during the first contract year with respect to an organization in a region.

            (B) __Contract period and effectiveness__ 

                [Section 1395w–27(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/c], except that in applying paragraph (4)(B) of such section any reference to payment amounts under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] shall be deemed payment amounts under [section 1395w–115 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–115].

            (C) __Protections against fraud and beneficiary protections__ 

                [Section 1395w–27(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/d].

            (D) __Additional contract terms__ 

            [Section 1395w–27(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/e]; except that [section 1395w–27(e)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/e/2] shall apply as specified to PDP sponsors and payments under this part to an MA–PD plan shall be treated as expenditures made under part D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, information provided to the Secretary under the application of [section 1395w–27(e)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/e/1] to contracts under this section under the preceding sentence—

                (i) may be used for the purposes of carrying out this part, improving public health through research on the utilization, safety, effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of health care services (as the Secretary determines appropriate); and

                (ii) shall be made available to Congressional  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized. </sup></sup>  support agencies (in accordance with their obligations to support Congress as set out in their authorizing statutes) for the purposes of conducting Congressional  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  oversight, monitoring, making recommendations, and analysis of the program under this subchapter.

            (E) __Intermediate sanctions__ 

                [Section 1395w–27(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/g] (other than paragraph (1)(F) of such section), except that in applying such section the reference in [section 1395w–27(g)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/g/1/B] to [section 1395w–24 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–24] is deemed a reference to this part.

            (F) __Procedures for termination__ 

                [Section 1395w–27(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27/h].

        (4) __Prompt payment of clean claims__ 

            (A) __Prompt payment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to a prescription drug plan offered by such sponsor shall provide that payment shall be issued, mailed, or otherwise transmitted with respect to all clean claims submitted by pharmacies (other than pharmacies that dispense drugs by mail order only or are located in, or contract with, a long-term care facility) under this part within the applicable number of calendar days after the date on which the claim is received.

                (ii) __Clean claim defined__ 

                    In this paragraph, the term “clean claim” means a claim that has no defect or impropriety (including any lack of any required substantiating documentation) or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment from being made on the claim under this part.

                (iii) __Date of receipt of claim__ 

                In this paragraph, a claim is considered to have been received—

                    (I) with respect to claims submitted electronically, on the date on which the claim is transferred; and

                    (II) with respect to claims submitted otherwise, on the 5th day after the postmark date of the claim or the date specified in the time stamp of the transmission.

            (B) __Applicable number of calendar days defined__ 

            In this paragraph, the term “applicable number of calendar days” means—

                (i) with respect to claims submitted electronically, 14 days; and

                (ii) with respect to claims submitted otherwise, 30 days.

            (C) __Interest payment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), if payment is not issued, mailed, or otherwise transmitted within the applicable number of calendar days (as defined in subparagraph (B)) after a clean claim is received, the PDP sponsor shall pay interest to the pharmacy that submitted the claim at a rate equal to the weighted average of interest on 3-month marketable Treasury securities determined for such period, increased by 0.1 percentage point for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made (as determined under subparagraph (D)(iv)). Interest amounts paid under this subparagraph shall not be counted against the administrative costs of a prescription drug plan or treated as allowable risk corridor costs under [section 1395w–115(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–115/e].

                (ii) __Authority not to charge interest__ 

                    The Secretary may provide that a PDP sponsor is not charged interest under clause (i) in the case where there are exigent circumstances, including natural disasters and other unique and unexpected events, that prevent the timely processing of claims.

            (D) __Procedures involving claims__ 

                (i) __Claim deemed to be clean__ 

                A claim is deemed to be a clean claim if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any deficiency in the claim—

                    (I) with respect to claims submitted electronically, within 10 days after the date on which the claim is received; and

                    (II) with respect to claims submitted otherwise, within 15 days after the date on which the claim is received.

                (ii) __Claim determined to not be a clean claim__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        If a PDP sponsor determines that a submitted claim is not a clean claim, the PDP sponsor shall, not later than the end of the period described in clause (i), notify the claimant of such determination. Such notification shall specify all defects or improprieties in the claim and shall list all additional information or documents necessary for the proper processing and payment of the claim.

                    (II) __Determination after submission of additional information__ 

                        A claim is deemed to be a clean claim under this paragraph if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any defect or impropriety in the claim within 10 days of the date on which additional information is received under subclause (I).

                (iii) __Obligation to pay__ 

                    A claim submitted to a PDP sponsor that is not paid or contested by the sponsor within the applicable number of days (as defined in subparagraph (B)) after the date on which the claim is received shall be deemed to be a clean claim and shall be paid by the PDP sponsor in accordance with subparagraph (A).

                (iv) __Date of payment of claim__ 

                Payment of a clean claim under such subparagraph is considered to have been made on the date on which—

                    (I) with respect to claims paid electronically, the payment is transferred; and

                    (II) with respect to claims paid otherwise, the payment is submitted to the United States Postal Service or common carrier for delivery.

            (E) __Electronic transfer of funds__ 

                A PDP sponsor shall pay all clean claims submitted electronically by electronic transfer of funds if the pharmacy so requests or has so requested previously. In the case where such payment is made electronically, remittance may be made by the PDP sponsor electronically as well.

            (F) __Protecting the rights of claimants__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit or limit a claim or action not covered by the subject matter of this section that any individual or organization has against a provider or a PDP sponsor.

                (ii) __Anti-retaliation__ 

                    Consistent with applicable Federal or State law, a PDP sponsor shall not retaliate against an individual or provider for exercising a right of action under this subparagraph.

            (G) __Rule of construction__ 

                A determination under this paragraph that a claim submitted by a pharmacy is a clean claim shall not be construed as a positive determination regarding eligibility for payment under this subchapter, nor is it an indication of government approval of, or acquiescence regarding, the claim submitted. The determination shall not relieve any party of civil or criminal liability with respect to the claim, nor does it offer a defense to any administrative, civil, or criminal action with respect to the claim.

        (5) __Submission of claims by pharmacies located in or contracting with long-term care facilities__ 

            Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to a prescription drug plan offered by such sponsor shall provide that a pharmacy located in, or having a contract with, a long-term care facility shall have not less than 30 days (but not more than 90 days) to submit claims to the sponsor for reimbursement under the plan.

        (6) __Regular update of prescription drug pricing standard__ 

            If the PDP sponsor of a prescription drug plan uses a standard for reimbursement of pharmacies based on the cost of a drug, each contract entered into with such sponsor under this part with respect to the plan shall provide that the sponsor shall update such standard not less frequently than once every 7 days, beginning with an initial update on January 1 of each year, to accurately reflect the market price of acquiring the drug.

    (c) __Waiver of certain requirements to expand choice__ 

        (1) __Authorizing waiver__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of an entity that seeks to offer a prescription drug plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section that the entity be licensed in that State if the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in paragraph (2) have been met.

            (B) __Application of regional plan waiver rule__ 

                In addition to the waiver available under subparagraph (A), the provisions of [section 1395w–27a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27a/d] shall apply to PDP sponsors under this part in a manner similar to the manner in which such provisions apply to MA organizations under part C of this subchapter, except that no application shall be required under paragraph (1)(B) of such section in the case of a State that does not provide a licensing process for such a sponsor.

        (2) __Grounds for approval__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The grounds for approval under this paragraph are—

                (i) subject to subparagraph (B), the grounds for approval described in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of [section 1395w–25(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25/a/2]; and

                (ii) the application by a State of any grounds other than those required under Federal law.

            (B) __Special rules__ 

            In applying subparagraph (A)(i)—

                (i) the ground of approval described in [section 1395w–25(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25/a/2/B] is deemed to have been met if the State does not have a licensing process in effect with respect to the PDP sponsor; and

                (ii) for plan years beginning before January 1, 2008, if the State does have such a licensing process in effect, such ground for approval described in such section is deemed to have been met upon submission of an application described in such section.

        (3) __Application of waiver procedures__ 

            With respect to an application for a waiver (or a waiver granted) under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the provisions of subparagraphs (E), (F), and (G) of [section 1395w–25(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25/a/2] shall apply, except that clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph (E) shall not apply in the case of a State that does not have a licensing process described in paragraph (2)(B)(i) in effect.

        (4) __References to certain provisions__ 

        In applying provisions of [section 1395w–25(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25/a/2] under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection to prescription drug plans and PDP sponsors—

            (A) any reference to a waiver application under [section 1395w–25 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25] shall be treated as a reference to a waiver application under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; and

            (B) any reference to solvency standards shall be treated as a reference to solvency standards established under subsection (d) of this section.

    (d) __Solvency standards for non-licensed entities__ 

        (1) __Establishment and publication__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall establish and publish, by not later than January 1, 2005, financial solvency and capital adequacy standards for entities described in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Compliance with standards__ 

            A PDP sponsor that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a)(1) of this section and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (c) of this section shall meet solvency and capital adequacy standards established under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall establish certification procedures for such sponsors with respect to such solvency standards in the manner described in [section 1395w–25(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–25/c/2].

    (e) __Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification__ 

        The fact that a PDP sponsor is licensed in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or has a waiver application approved under subsection (c) of this section does not deem the sponsor to meet other requirements imposed under this part for a sponsor.

    (f) __Periodic review and revision of standards__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may periodically review the standards established under this section and, based on such review, may revise such standards if the Secretary determines such revision to be appropriate.

        (2) __Prohibition of midyear implementation of significant new regulatory requirements__ 

            The Secretary may not implement, other than at the beginning of a calendar year, regulations under this section that impose new, significant regulatory requirements on a PDP sponsor or a prescription drug plan.

    (g) __Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes; relation to State laws__ 

        The provisions of sections 1395w–24(g) and 1395w–26(b)(3) of this title shall apply with respect to PDP sponsors and prescription drug plans under this part in the same manner as such sections apply to MA organizations and MA plans under part C of this subchapter.
