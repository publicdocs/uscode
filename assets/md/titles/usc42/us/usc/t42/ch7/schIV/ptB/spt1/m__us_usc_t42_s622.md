 __References in Text__ 

    Division A of subchapter XX, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), (2), was in the original a reference to subtitle 1 of title XX, which was translated as if referring to subtitle A of title XX of the Social Security Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Title XX of the Act, enacting subchapter XX of this chapter, does not contain a subtitle 1.

    Section 103(d) of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), is [section 103(d) of Pub. L. 96–272][/us/pl/96/272/s103/d], which is set out as a note below.

    The Indian Child Welfare Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(9), probably means the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, [Pub. L. 95–608][/us/pl/95/608], Nov. 8, 1978, [92 Stat. 3069][/us/stat/92/3069], which is classified principally to chapter 21 (§ 1901 et seq.) of Title 25, Indians. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1901 of Title 25][/us/usc/t25/s1901] and Tables.
