## § 629. Purpose

The purpose of this program is to enable States to develop and establish, or expand, and to operate coordinated programs of community-based family support services, family preservation services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services to accomplish the following objectives:

    (1) To prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through the provision of supportive family services.

    (2) To assure children’s safety within the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, when the family’s problems can be addressed effectively.

    (3) To address the problems of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification may occur in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.

    (4) To support adoptive families by providing support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their children.
