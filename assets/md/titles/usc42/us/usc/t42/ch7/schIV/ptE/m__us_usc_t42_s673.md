        (2)

            (A)

             For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a child meets the requirements of this paragraph if—

                    (II) has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, to be a child with special needs; or

                (ii)

                 in the case of a child who is an applicable child for the fiscal year (as so defined), the child—

                    (I)

                        (aa)

                            (AA) an involuntary removal of the child from the home in accordance with a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child; or

                            (BB) a voluntary placement agreement or voluntary relinquishment; and

            (C)

             A child shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph for the purpose of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) if—

                (i)

                 in the case of a child who is not an applicable child for the fiscal year (as defined in subsection (e)), the child—

                    (I) meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i)(II);

                    (II) was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part with respect to a prior adoption;

                    (III)

                     is available for adoption because—

                        (aa) the prior adoption has been dissolved, and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated; or

                        (bb) the child’s adoptive parents have died; and

                    (IV)

                     fails to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i) but would meet such requirements if—

                        (aa) the child were treated as if the child were in the same financial and other circumstances the child was in the last time the child was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part; and

                        (bb) the prior adoption were treated as never having occurred; or

                (ii) in the case of a child who is an applicable child for the fiscal year (as so defined), the child meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), is determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part with respect to a prior adoption (or who would have been determined eligible for such payments had the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 been in effect at the time that such determination would have been made), and is available for adoption because the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated or because the child’s adoptive parents have died.

            (D) In determining the eligibility for adoption assistance payments of a child in a legal guardianship arrangement described in [section 671(a)(28) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671/a/28], the placement of the child with the relative guardian involved and any kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of the child shall be considered never to have been made.

        (3) The amount of the payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive parents and the State or local agency administering the program under this section, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be specified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such circumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance payment made under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) exceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been paid during the period if the child with respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a foster family home.

        (4)

            (A)

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payment may not be made pursuant to this section to parents or relative guardians with respect to a child—

                (i)

                 who has attained—

                    (I) 18 years of age, or such greater age as the State may elect under [section 675(8)(B)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s675/8/B/iii]; or

                    (II) 21 years of age, if the State determines that the child has a mental or physical handicap which warrants the continuation of assistance;

                (ii) who has not attained 18 years of age, if the State determines that the parents or relative guardians, as the case may be, are no longer legally responsible for the support of the child; or

                (iii) if the State determines that the child is no longer receiving any support from the parents or relative guardians, as the case may be.

            (B) Parents or relative guardians who have been receiving adoption assistance payments or kinship guardianship assistance payments under this section shall keep the State or local agency administering the program under this section informed of circumstances which would, pursuant to this subsection, make them ineligible for the payments, or eligible for the payments in a different amount.

        (5) For purposes of this part, individuals with whom a child (who has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs) is placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law shall be eligible for such payments, during the period of the placement, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as if such individuals had adopted such child.

        (6)

            (A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), the term “nonrecurring adoption expenses” means reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and which are not incurred in violation of State or Federal law.

            (B) A State’s payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses under an adoption assistance agreement shall be treated as an expenditure made for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan for purposes of [section 674(a)(3)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s674/a/3/E].

        (7)

            (A)

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, no payment may be made to parents with respect to any applicable child for a fiscal year that—

                (i) would be considered a child with special needs under subsection (c)(2);

                (ii) is not a citizen or resident of the United States; and

                (iii) was adopted outside of the United States or was brought into the United States for the purpose of being adopted.

            (B) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as prohibiting payments under this part for an applicable child described in subparagraph (A) that is placed in foster care subsequent to the failure, as determined by the State, of the initial adoption of the child by the parents described in subparagraph (A).

        (8)

            (A) A State shall calculate the savings (if any) resulting from the application of paragraph (2)(A)(ii) to all applicable children for a fiscal year, using a methodology specified by the Secretary or an alternate methodology proposed by the State and approved by the Secretary.

            (B)

             A State shall annually report to the Secretary—

                (i) the methodology used to make the calculation described in subparagraph (A), without regard to whether any savings are found;

                (ii) the amount of any savings referred to in subparagraph (A); and

                (iii) how any such savings are spent, accounting for and reporting the spending separately from any other spending reported to the Secretary under part B or this part.

            (C) The Secretary shall make all information reported pursuant to subparagraph (B) available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services in a location easily accessible to the public.

            (D)

                (i) A State shall spend an amount equal to the amount of the savings (if any) in State expenditures under this part resulting from the application of paragraph (2)(A)(ii) to all applicable children for a fiscal year, to provide to children of families any service that may be provided under part B or this part. A State shall spend not less than 30 percent of any such savings on post-adoption services, post-guardianship services, and services to support and sustain positive permanent outcomes for children who otherwise might enter into foster care under the responsibility of the State, with at least ⅔ of the spending by the State to comply with such 30 percent requirement being spent on post-adoption and post-guardianship services.

                (ii) Any State spending required under clause (i) shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, any Federal or non-Federal funds used to provide any service under part B or this part.

    (b) __Aid for dependent children; assistance for minor children in needy families__ 

        (1) For purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a dependent child as defined in [section 606 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s606] (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) and deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter (as so in effect) in the State where such child resides.

        (2) For purposes of division A  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of subchapter XX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a minor child in a needy family under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter and deemed to be a recipient of assistance under such part.

        (3)

         A child described in this paragraph is any child—

            (A)

                (i) who is a child described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, and

            (B) with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under [section 672 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s672], or

            (C) with respect to whom kinship guardianship assistance payments are being made pursuant to subsection (d).

        (4) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to the child’s minor parent, as provided in [section 675(4)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s675/4/B], shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under [section 672 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s672].

    (c) __Children with special needs__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1)

         in the case of a child who is not an applicable child for a fiscal year, the child shall not be considered a child with special needs unless—

            (A) the State has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents; and

            (B) the State had first determined (A) that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and (B) that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter; or

        (2)

         in the case of a child who is an applicable child for a fiscal year, the child shall not be considered a child with special needs unless—

                (i) the State has determined that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section and medical assistance under subchapter XIX; or

                (ii) the child meets all medical or disability requirements of subchapter XVI with respect to eligibility for supplemental security income benefits; and

            (C) the State has determined that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of the parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX.
