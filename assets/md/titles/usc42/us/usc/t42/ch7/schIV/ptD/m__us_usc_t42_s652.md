    (d) __Child support management information system__ 

        (1)

         Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Secretary shall not approve the initial and annually updated advance automated data processing planning document, referred to in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16], unless he finds that such document, when implemented, will generally carry out the objectives of the management system referred to in such subsection, and such document—

            (A) provides for the conduct of, and reflects the results of, requirements analysis studies, which include consideration of the program mission, functions, organization, services, constraints, and current support, of, in, or relating to, such system,

            (B) contains a description of the proposed management system referred to in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16], including a description of information flows, input data, and output reports and uses,

            (C) sets forth the security and interface requirements to be employed in such management system,

            (D) describes the projected resource requirements for staff and other needs, and the resources available or expected to be available to meet such requirements,

            (E) contains an implementation plan and backup procedures to handle possible failures,

            (F) contains a summary of proposed improvement of such management system in terms of qualitative and quantitative benefits, and

            (G) provides such other information as the Secretary determines under regulation is necessary.

        (2)

            (A) The Secretary shall through the separate organizational unit established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, on a continuing basis, review, assess, and inspect the planning, design, and operation of, management information systems referred to in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16], with a view to determining whether, and to what extent, such systems meet and continue to meet requirements imposed under paragraph (1) and the conditions specified under [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16].

            (B) If the Secretary finds with respect to any statewide management information system referred to in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16] that there is a failure substantially to comply with criteria, requirements, and other undertakings, prescribed by the advance automated data processing planning document theretofore approved by the Secretary with respect to such system, then the Secretary shall suspend his approval of such document until there is no longer any such failure of such system to comply with such criteria, requirements, and other undertakings so prescribed.

        (3)

         The Secretary may waive any requirement of paragraph (1) or any condition specified under [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16], and shall waive the single statewide system requirement under sections 654(16) and 654a of this title, with respect to a State if—

            (A)

             the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has or can develop an alternative system or systems that enable the State—

                (i) for purposes of [section 609(a)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s609/a/8], to achieve the paternity establishment percentages (as defined in subsection (g)(2) of this section) and other performance measures that may be established by the Secretary;

                (ii) to submit data under [section 654(15)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/15/B] that is complete and reliable;

                (iii) to substantially comply with the requirements of this part; and

                (iv)

                 in the case of a request to waive the single statewide system requirement, to—

                    (I) meet all functional requirements of sections 654(16) and 654a of this title;

                    (II) ensure that calculation of distributions meets the requirements of [section 657 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s657] and accounts for distributions to children in different families or in different States or sub-State jurisdictions, and for distributions to other States;

                    (III) ensure that there is only one point of contact in the State which provides seamless case processing for all interstate case processing and coordinated, automated intrastate case management;

                    (IV) ensure that standardized data elements, forms, and definitions are used throughout the State;

                    (V) complete the alternative system in no more time than it would take to complete a single statewide system that meets such requirement; and

                    (VI) process child support cases as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as such cases would be processed through a single statewide system that meets such requirement;

            (B)

                (i) the waiver meets the criteria of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of [section 1315(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1315/c]; or

                (ii) the State provides assurances to the Secretary that steps will be taken to otherwise improve the State’s child support enforcement program; and

            (C) in the case of a request to waive the single statewide system requirement, the State has submitted to the Secretary separate estimates of the total cost of a single statewide system that meets such requirement, and of any such alternative system or systems, which shall include estimates of the cost of developing and completing the system and of operating and maintaining the system for 5 years, and the Secretary has agreed with the estimates.

    (e) __Technical assistance to States__ 

        The Secretary shall provide such technical assistance to States as he determines necessary to assist States to plan, design, develop, or install and provide for the security of, the management information systems referred to in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16].

    (f) __Regulations__ 

        The Secretary shall issue regulations to require that State agencies administering the child support enforcement program under this part enforce medical support included as part of a child support order whenever health care coverage is available to the noncustodial parent at a reasonable cost. A State agency administering the program under this part may enforce medical support against a custodial parent if health care coverage is available to the custodial parent at a reasonable cost, notwithstanding any other provision of this part. Such regulation shall also provide for improved information exchange between such State agencies and the State agencies administering the State medicaid programs under subchapter XIX of this chapter with respect to the availability of health insurance coverage. For purposes of this part, the term “medical support” may include health care coverage, such as coverage under a health insurance plan (including payment of costs of premiums, co-payments, and deductibles) and payment for medical expenses incurred on behalf of a child.

    (g) __Performance standards for State paternity establishment programs__ 

        (1)

         A State’s program under this part shall be found, for purposes of [section 609(a)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s609/a/8], not to have complied substantially with the requirements of this part unless, for any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1994, its paternity establishment percentage for such fiscal year is based on reliable data and (rounded to the nearest whole percentage point) equals or exceeds—

            (A) 90 percent;

            (B) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 75 percent but less than 90 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 2 percentage points;

            (C) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 50 percent but less than 75 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 3 percentage points;

            (D) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 45 percent but less than 50 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 4 percentage points;

            (E) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 40 percent but less than 45 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 5 percentage points; or

            (F) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of less than 40 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 6 percentage points.

            In determining compliance under this section, a State may use as its paternity establishment percentage either the State’s IV–D paternity establishment percentage (as defined in paragraph (2)(A)) or the State’s statewide paternity establishment percentage (as defined in paragraph (2)(B)).

        (2)

         For purposes of this section—

            (A)

             the term “IV–D paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of children—

                (i) who have been born out of wedlock,

                (ii)

                    (I) except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year, or (II) with respect to whom services are being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year pursuant to an application submitted under [section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/4/A/ii], and

                (iii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged,

                bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock and (except as provided in such last sentence) with respect to whom assistance was being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter as of the end of the preceding fiscal year or with respect to whom services were being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part as of the end of the preceding fiscal year pursuant to an application submitted under [section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/4/A/ii];

            (B)

             the term “statewide paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of minor children—

                (i) who have been born out of wedlock, and

                (ii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged during the fiscal year,

                bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock during the preceding fiscal year; and

            (C) the term “reliable data” means the most recent data available which are found by the Secretary to be reliable for purposes of this section.

            For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the total number of children shall not include any child with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter by reason of the death of a parent unless paternity is established for such child or any child with respect to whom an applicant or recipient is found by the State to qualify for a good cause or other exception to cooperation pursuant to [section 654(29) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/29].

        (3)

            (A) The Secretary may modify the requirements of this subsection to take into account such additional variables as the Secretary identifies (including the percentage of children in a State who are born out of wedlock or for whom support has not been established) that affect the ability of a State to meet the requirements of this subsection.

            (B) The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the Congress that sets forth the data upon which the paternity establishment percentages for States for a fiscal year are based, lists any additional variables the Secretary has identified under subparagraph (A), and describes State performance in establishing paternity.

    (h) __Prompt State response to requests for child support assistance__ 

        The standards required by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall include standards establishing time limits governing the period or periods within which a State must accept and respond to requests (from States, jurisdictions thereof, or individuals who apply for services furnished by the State agency under this part or with respect to whom an assignment pursuant to [section 608(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s608/a/3] is in effect) for assistance in establishing and enforcing support orders, including requests to locate noncustodial parents, establish paternity, and initiate proceedings to establish and collect child support awards.

    (i) __Prompt State distribution of amounts collected as child support__ 

        The standards required by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall include standards establishing time limits governing the period or periods within which a State must distribute, in accordance with [section 657 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s657], amounts collected as child support pursuant to the State’s plan approved under this part.

    (j) __Training of Federal and State staff, research and demonstration programs, and special projects of regional or national significance__ 

    Out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, there is hereby appropriated to the Secretary for each fiscal year an amount equal to 1 percent of the total amount paid to the Federal Government pursuant to a plan approved under this part during the immediately preceding fiscal year (as determined on the basis of the most recent reliable data available to the Secretary as of the end of the third calendar quarter following the end of such preceding fiscal year) or the amount appropriated under this paragraph  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

        The amount appropriated under this subsection shall remain available until expended.

    (k) __Denial of passports for nonpayment of child support__

        (2) The Secretary of State shall, upon certification by the Secretary transmitted under paragraph (1), refuse to issue a passport to such individual, and may revoke, restrict, or limit a passport issued previously to such individual.

        (3) The Secretary and the Secretary of State shall not be liable to an individual for any action with respect to a certification by a State agency under this section.

    (l) __Facilitation of agreements between State agencies and financial institutions__ 

        The Secretary, through the Federal Parent Locator Service, may aid State agencies providing services under State programs operated pursuant to this part and financial institutions doing business in two or more States in reaching agreements regarding the receipt from such institutions, and the transfer to the State agencies, of information that may be provided pursuant to [section 666(a)(17)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s666/a/17/A/i], except that any State that, as of July 16, 1998, is conducting data matches pursuant to [section 666(a)(17)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s666/a/17/A/i] shall have until January 1, 2000, to allow the Secretary to obtain such information from such institutions that are operating in the State. For purposes of [section 3413(d) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s3413/d], a disclosure pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a disclosure pursuant to a Federal statute.

    (m) __Comparisons with insurance information__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary, through the Federal Parent Locator Service, may—

            (A) compare information concerning individuals owing past-due support with information maintained by insurers (or their agents) concerning insurance claims, settlements, awards, and payments; and

            (B) furnish information resulting from the data matches to the State agencies responsible for collecting child support from the individuals.

        (2) __Liability__
