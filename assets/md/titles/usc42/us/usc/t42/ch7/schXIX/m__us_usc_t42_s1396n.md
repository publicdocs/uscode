## § 1396n. Compliance with State plan and payment provisions

    (a) __Activities deemed as compliance__ 

    A State shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (10), or (23) of [section 1396a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a] solely by reason of the fact that the State (or any political subdivision thereof)—

        (1)

         has entered into—

            (A) a contract with an organization which has agreed to provide care and services in addition to those offered under the State plan to individuals eligible for medical assistance who reside in the geographic area served by such organization and who elect to obtain such care and services from such organization, or by reason of the fact that the plan provides for payment for rural health clinic services only if those services are provided by a rural health clinic; or

            (B)

             arrangements through a competitive bidding process or otherwise for the purchase of laboratory services referred to in [section 1396d(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a/3] or medical devices if the Secretary has found that—

                (i) adequate services or devices will be available under such arrangements, and

                (ii)

                 any such laboratory services will be provided only through laboratories—

                    (I) which meet the applicable requirements of [section 1395x(e)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/e/9] or paragraphs (16) and (17) of [section 1395x(s) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/s], and such additional requirements as the Secretary may require, and

                    (II) no more than 75 percent of whose charges for such services are for services provided to individuals who are entitled to benefits under this subchapter or under part A or part B of subchapter XVIII of this chapter; or

        (2)

         restricts for a reasonable period of time the provider or providers from which an individual (eligible for medical assistance for items or services under the State plan) can receive such items or services, if—

            (A) the State has found, after notice and opportunity for a hearing (in accordance with procedures established by the State), that the individual has utilized such items or services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary (as determined in accordance with utilization guidelines established by the State), and

            (B) under such restriction, individuals eligible for medical assistance for such services have reasonable access (taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time) to such services of adequate quality.

    (b) __Waivers to promote cost-effectiveness and efficiency__ 

    The Secretary, to the extent he finds it to be cost-effective and efficient and not inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter, may waive such requirements of [section 1396a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a] (other than subsection (s)) (other than sections 1396a(a)(15), 1396a(bb), and 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title insofar as it requires provision of the care and services described in [section 1396d(a)(2)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a/2/C]) as may be necessary for a State—

        (1) to implement a primary care case-management system or a specialty physician services arrangement which restricts the provider from (or through) whom an individual (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) can obtain medical care services (other than in emergency circumstances), if such restriction does not substantially impair access to such services of adequate quality where medically necessary,

        (2) to allow a locality to act as a central broker in assisting individuals (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) in selecting among competing health care plans, if such restriction does not substantially impair access to services of adequate quality where medically necessary,

        (3) to share (through provision of additional services) with recipients of medical assistance under the State plan cost savings resulting from use by the recipient of more cost-effective medical care, and

        (4) to restrict the provider from (or through) whom an individual (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) can obtain services (other than in emergency circumstances) to providers or practitioners who undertake to provide such services and who meet, accept, and comply with the reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards under the State plan, which standards shall be consistent with the requirements of [section 1396r–4 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396r–4] and are consistent with access, quality, and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services, if such restriction does not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in providing those services and if providers under such restriction are paid on a timely basis in the same manner as health care practitioners must be paid under [section 1396a(a)(37)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/37/A].

        No waiver under this subsection may restrict the choice of the individual in receiving services under [section 1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a/4/C]. Subsection (h)(2) shall apply to a waiver under this subsection.

    (c) __Waiver respecting medical assistance requirement in State plan; scope, etc.; “habilitation services” defined; imposition of certain regulatory limits prohibited; computation of expenditures for certain disabled patients; coordinated services; substitution of participants__ 

        (1) The Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan approved under this subchapter may include as “medical assistance” under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than room and board) approved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term “room and board” shall not include an amount established under a method determined by the State to reflect the portion of costs of rent and food attributable to an unrelated personal caregiver who is residing in the same household with an individual who, but for the assistance of such caregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.

        (2)

         A waiver shall not be granted under this subsection unless the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that—

            (A) necessary safeguards (including adequate standards for provider participation) have been taken to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services under the waiver and to assure financial accountability for funds expended with respect to such services;

            (B)

             the State will provide, with respect to individuals who—

                (i) are entitled to medical assistance for inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded under the State plan,

                (ii) may require such services, and

                (iii) may be eligible for such home or community-based care under such waiver,

                for an evaluation of the need for inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded;

            (C) such individuals who are determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded are informed of the feasible alternatives, if available under the waiver, at the choice of such individuals, to the provision of inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded;

            (D) under such waiver the average per capita expenditure estimated by the State in any fiscal year for medical assistance provided with respect to such individuals does not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made in that fiscal year for expenditures under the State plan for such individuals if the waiver had not been granted; and

            (E) the State will provide to the Secretary annually, consistent with a data collection plan designed by the Secretary, information on the impact of the waiver granted under this subsection on the type and amount of medical assistance provided under the State plan and on the health and welfare of recipients.

        (3) A waiver granted under this subsection may include a waiver of the requirements of [section 1396a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/1] (relating to statewideness), [section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/B] (relating to comparability), and [section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/C/i/III] (relating to income and resource rules applicable in the community). A waiver under this subsection (other than a waiver described in subsection (h)(2)) shall be for an initial term of three years and, upon the request of a State, shall be extended for additional five-year periods unless the Secretary determines that for the previous waiver period the assurances provided under paragraph (2) have not been met. A waiver may provide, with respect to post-eligibility treatment of income of all individuals receiving services under that waiver, that the maximum amount of the individual’s income which may be disregarded for any month for the maintenance needs of the individual may be an amount greater than the maximum allowed for that purpose under regulations in effect on July 1, 1985.

        (4)

         A waiver granted under this subsection may, consistent with paragraph (2)—

            (A) limit the individuals provided benefits under such waiver to individuals with respect to whom the State has determined that there is a reasonable expectation that the amount of medical assistance provided with respect to the individual under such waiver will not exceed the amount of such medical assistance provided for such individual if the waiver did not apply, and

            (B) provide medical assistance to individuals (to the extent consistent with written plans of care, which are subject to the approval of the State) for case management services, homemaker/home health aide services and personal care services, adult day health services, habilitation services, respite care, and such other services requested by the State as the Secretary may approve and for day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for individuals with chronic mental illness.

            Except as provided under paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary may not restrict the number of hours or days of respite care in any period which a State may provide under a waiver under this subsection.

        (5)

         For purposes of paragraph (4)(B), the term “habilitation services”—

            (A) means services designed to assist individuals in acquiring, retaining, and improving the self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home and community based settings; and

            (B) includes (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) prevocational, educational, and supported employment services; but

            (C)

             does not include—

                (i) special education and related services (as such terms are defined in [section 1401 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s1401]) which otherwise are available to the individual through a local educational agency; and

                (ii) vocational rehabilitation services which otherwise are available to the individual through a program funded under [section 730 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s730].

        (6) The Secretary may not require, as a condition of approval of a waiver under this section under paragraph (2)(D), that the actual total expenditures for home and community-based services under the waiver (and a claim for Federal financial participation in expenditures for the services) cannot exceed the approved estimates for these services. The Secretary may not deny Federal financial payment with respect to services under such a waiver on the ground that, in order to comply with paragraph (2)(D), a State has failed to comply with such a requirement.

        (7)

            (A) In making estimates under paragraph (2)(D) in the case of a waiver that applies only to individuals with a particular illness or condition who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, hospitals, nursing facilities, or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, the State may determine the average per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, those respective facilities.

            (B) In making estimates under paragraph (2)(D) in the case of a waiver that applies only to individuals with developmental disabilities who are inpatients in a nursing facility and whom the State has determined, on the basis of an evaluation under paragraph (2)(B), to need the level of services provided by an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan on the basis of the average per capita expenditures under the State plan for services to individuals who are inpatients in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, without regard to the availability of beds for such inpatients.

            (C) In making estimates under paragraph (2)(D) in the case of a waiver to the extent that it applies to individuals with mental retardation or a related condition who are resident in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the participation of which under the State plan is terminated, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals without regard to any such termination.

        (8) The State agency administering the plan under this subchapter may, whenever appropriate, enter into cooperative arrangements with the State agency responsible for administering the program for children with special health care needs under subchapter V of this chapter in order to assure improved access to coordinated services to meet the needs of such children.

        (9) In the case of any waiver under this subsection which contains a limit on the number of individuals who shall receive home or community-based services, the State may substitute additional individuals to receive such services to replace any individuals who die or become ineligible for services under the State plan.

        (10) The Secretary shall not limit to fewer than 200 the number of individuals in the State who may receive home and community-based services under a waiver under this subsection.

    (d) __Home and community-based services for elderly__ 

        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall grant a waiver to provide that a State plan approved under this subchapter shall include as “medical assistance” under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than room and board) which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care to individuals 65 years of age or older with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would be likely to require the level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term “room and board” shall not include an amount established under a method determined by the State to reflect the portion of costs of rent and food attributable to an unrelated personal caregiver who is residing in the same household with an individual who, but for the assistance of such caregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.

        (2)

         A waiver shall not be granted under this subsection unless the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that—

            (A) necessary safeguards (including adequate standards for provider participation) have been taken to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services under the waiver and to assure financial accountability for funds expended with respect to such services;

            (B)

             with respect to individuals 65 years of age or older who—

                (i) are entitled to medical assistance for skilled nursing or intermediate care facility services under the State plan,

                (ii) may require such services, and

                (iii) may be eligible for such home or community-based services under such waiver,

                the State will provide for an evaluation of the need for such skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility services; and

            (C) such individuals who are determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility are informed of the feasible alternatives to the provision of skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility services, which such individuals may choose if available under the waiver.

            Each State with a waiver under this subsection shall provide to the Secretary annually, consistent with a reasonable data collection plan designed by the Secretary, information on the impact of the waiver granted under this subsection on the type and amount of medical assistance provided under the State plan and on the health and welfare of recipients.

        (3) A waiver granted under this subsection may include a waiver of the requirements of [section 1396a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/1] (relating to statewideness), [section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/B] (relating to comparability), and [section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/C/i/III] (relating to income and resource rules applicable in the community). Subject to a termination by the State (with notice to the Secretary) at any time, a waiver under this subsection (other than a waiver described in subsection (h)(2)) shall be for an initial term of 3 years and, upon the request of a State, shall be extended for additional 5-year periods unless the Secretary determines that for the previous waiver period the assurances provided under paragraph (2) have not been met. A waiver may provide, with respect to post-eligibility treatment of income of all individuals receiving services under the waiver, that the maximum amount of the individual’s income which may be disregarded for any month is equal to the amount that may be allowed for that purpose under a waiver under subsection (c) of this section.

        (4) A waiver under this subsection may, consistent with paragraph (2), provide medical assistance to individuals for case management services, homemaker/home health aide services and personal care services, adult day health services, respite care, and other medical and social services that can contribute to the health and well-being of individuals and their ability to reside in a community-based care setting.

        (5)

            (A) In the case of a State having a waiver approved under this subsection, notwithstanding any other provision of [section 1396b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b] to the contrary, the total amount expended by the State for medical assistance with respect to skilled nursing facility services, intermediate care facility services, and home and community-based services under the State plan for individuals 65 years of age or older during a waiver year under this subsection may not exceed the projected amount determined under subparagraph (B).

            (B)

             For purposes of subparagraph (A), the projected amount under this subparagraph is the sum of the following:

                (i)

                 The aggregate amount of the State’s medical assistance under this subchapter for skilled nursing facility services and intermediate care facility services furnished to individuals who have attained the age of 65 for the base year increased by a percentage which is equal to the lesser of 7 percent times the number of years (rounded to the nearest quarter of a year) beginning after the base year and ending at the end of the waiver year involved or the sum of—

                    (I) the percentage increase (based on an appropriate market-basket index representing the costs of elements of such services) between the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the waiver year involved, plus

                    (II) the percentage increase between the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the waiver year involved in the number of residents in the State who have attained the age of 65, plus

                    (III) 2 percent for each year (rounded to the nearest quarter of a year) beginning after the base year and ending at the end of the waiver year.

                (ii)

                 The aggregate amount of the State’s medical assistance under this subchapter for home and community-based services for individuals who have attained the age of 65 for the base year increased by a percentage which is equal to the lesser of 7 percent times the number of years (rounded to the nearest quarter of a year) beginning after the base year and ending at the end of the waiver year involved or the sum of—

                    (I) the percentage increase (based on an appropriate market-basket index representing the costs of elements of such services) between the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the waiver year involved, plus

                    (II) the percentage increase between the beginning of the base year and the beginning of the waiver year involved in the number of residents in the State who have attained the age of 65, plus

                    (III) 2 percent for each year (rounded to the nearest quarter of a year) beginning after the base year and ending at the end of the waiver year.

                (iii)

                 The Secretary shall develop and promulgate by regulation (by not later than October 1, 1989)—

                    (I) a method, based on an index of appropriately weighted indicators of changes in the wages and prices of the mix of goods and services which comprise both skilled nursing facility services and intermediate care facility services (regardless of the source of payment for such services), for projecting the percentage increase for purposes of clause (i)(I);

                    (II) a method, based on an index of appropriately weighted indicators of changes in the wages and prices of the mix of goods and services which comprise home and community-based services (regardless of the source of payment for such services), for projecting the percentage increase for purposes of clause (ii)(I); and

                    (III) a method for projecting, on a State specific basis, the percentage increase in the number of residents in each State who are over 65 years of age for any period.

                    The Secretary shall develop (by not later than October 1, 1989) a method for projecting, on a State-specific basis, the percentage increase in the number of residents in each State who are over 65 years of age for any period. Effective on and after the date the Secretary promulgates the regulation under clause (iii), any reference in this subparagraph to the “lesser of 7 percent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the “greater of 7 percent”.

                (iv) If there is enacted after December 22, 1987, an Act which amends this subchapter whose provisions become effective on or after such date and which results in an increase in the aggregate amount of medical assistance under this subchapter for nursing facility services and home and community-based services for individuals who have attained the age of 65 years, the Secretary, at the request of a State with a waiver under this subsection for a waiver year or years and in close consultation with the State, shall adjust the projected amount computed under this subparagraph for the waiver year or years to take into account such increase.

            (C)

             In this paragraph:

                (i) The term “home and community-based services” includes services described in sections 1396d(a)(7) and 1396d(a)(8) of this title, services described in subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section, services described in paragraph (4), and personal care services.

                (ii)

                    (I) Subject to subclause (II), the term “base year” means the most recent year (ending before December 22, 1987) for which actual final expenditures under this subchapter have been reported to, and accepted by, the Secretary.

                    (II) For purposes of subparagraph (C), in the case of a State that does not report expenditures on the basis of the age categories described in such subparagraph for a year ending before December 22, 1987, the term “base year” means fiscal year 1989.

                (iii) The term “intermediate care facility services” does not include services furnished in an institution certified in accordance with [section 1396d(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/d].

        (6)

            (A) A determination by the Secretary to deny a request for a waiver (or extension of waiver) under this subsection shall be subject to review to the extent provided under [section 1316(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1316/b].

            (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Secretary denies a request of the State for an extension of a waiver under this subsection, any waiver under this subsection in effect on the date such request is made shall remain in effect for a period of not less than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary denies such request (or, if the State seeks review of such determination in accordance with subparagraph (A), the date on which a final determination is made with respect to such review).

    (e) __Waiver for children infected with AIDS or drug dependent at birth__ 

        (1)

            (A) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall grant a waiver to provide that a State plan approved under this subchapter shall include as “medical assistance” under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of nursing care, respite care, physicians’ services, prescribed drugs, medical devices and supplies, transportation services, and such other services requested by the State as the Secretary may approve which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care to a child described in subparagraph (B) with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the infants would be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital or nursing facility the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan.

            (B)

             Children described in this subparagraph are individuals under 5 years of age who—

                (i) at the time of birth were infected with (or tested positively for) the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),

                (ii) have such syndrome, or

                (iii) at the time of birth were dependent on heroin, cocaine, or phencyclidine,

                and with respect to whom adoption or foster care assistance is (or will be) made available under part E of subchapter IV of this chapter.

        (2)

         A waiver shall not be granted under this subsection unless the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that—

            (A) necessary safeguards (including adequate standards for provider participation) have been taken to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services under the waiver and to assure financial accountability for funds expended with respect to such services;

            (B) under such waiver the average per capita expenditure estimated by the State in any fiscal year for medical assistance provided with respect to such individuals does not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made in that fiscal year for expenditures under the State plan for such individuals if the waiver had not been granted; and

            (C) the State will provide to the Secretary annually, consistent with a data collection plan designed by the Secretary, information on the impact of the waiver granted under this subsection on the type and amount of medical assistance provided under the State plan and on the health and welfare of recipients.

        (3) A waiver granted under this subsection may include a waiver of the requirements of [section 1396a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/1] (relating to statewideness) and [section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/B] (relating to comparability). A waiver under this subsection shall be for an initial term of 3 years and, upon the request of a State, shall be extended for additional five-year periods unless the Secretary determines that for the previous waiver period the assurances provided under paragraph (2) have not been met.

        (4) The provisions of paragraph (6) of subsection (d) of this section shall apply to this subsection in the same manner as it applies to subsection (d) of this section.

    (f) __Monitor of implementation of waivers; termination of waiver for noncompliance; time limitation for action on requests for plan approval, amendments, or waivers__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall monitor the implementation of waivers granted under this section to assure that the requirements for such waiver are being met and shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, terminate any such waiver where he finds noncompliance has occurred.

        (2) A request to the Secretary from a State for approval of a proposed State plan or plan amendment or a waiver of a requirement of this subchapter submitted by the State pursuant to a provision of this subchapter shall be deemed granted unless the Secretary, within 90 days after the date of its submission to the Secretary, either denies such request in writing or informs the State agency in writing with respect to any additional information which is needed in order to make a final determination with respect to the request. After the date the Secretary receives such additional information, the request shall be deemed granted unless the Secretary, within 90 days of such date, denies such request.

    (g) __Optional targeted case management services__ 

        (1) A State may provide, as medical assistance, case management services under the plan without regard to the requirements of [section 1396a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/1] and [section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/B]. The provision of case management services under this subsection shall not restrict the choice of the individual to receive medical assistance in violation of [section 1396a(a)(23) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/23]. A State may limit the provision of case management services under this subsection to individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or with AIDS-related conditions, or with either, or to individuals described in [section 1396a(z)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/z/1/A] and a State may limit the provision of case management services under this subsection to individuals with chronic mental illness. The State may limit the case managers available with respect to case management services for eligible individuals with developmental disabilities or with chronic mental illness in order to ensure that the case managers for such individuals are capable of ensuring that such individuals receive needed services.

        (2)

         For purposes of this subsection:

            (A)

                (i) The term “case management services” means services which will assist individuals eligible under the plan in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services.

                (ii)

                 Such term includes the following:

                    (I)

                     Assessment of an eligible individual to determine service needs, including activities that focus on needs identification, to determine the need for any medical, educational, social, or other services. Such assessment activities include the following:

                        (aa) Taking client history.

                        (bb) Identifying the needs of the individual, and completing related documentation.

                        (cc) Gathering information from other sources such as family members, medical providers, social workers, and educators, if necessary, to form a complete assessment of the eligible individual.

                    (II) Development of a specific care plan based on the information collected through an assessment, that specifies the goals and actions to address the medical, social, educational, and other services needed by the eligible individual, including activities such as ensuring the active participation of the eligible individual and working with the individual (or the individual’s authorized health care decision maker) and others to develop such goals and identify a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the eligible individual.
