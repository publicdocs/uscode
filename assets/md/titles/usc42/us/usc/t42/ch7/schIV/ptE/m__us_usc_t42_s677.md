## § 677. John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program

    (a) __Purpose__ 

    The purpose of this section is to provide States with flexible funding that will enable programs to be designed and conducted—

        (1) to identify children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age and to help these children make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing services such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, vocational training, job placement and retention, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, substance abuse prevention, and preventive health activities (including smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy prevention);

        (2) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age receive the education, training, and services necessary to obtain employment;

        (3) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age prepare for and enter postsecondary training and education institutions;

        (4) to provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults;

        (5) to provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood;

        (6) to make available vouchers for education and training, including postsecondary training and education, to youths who have aged out of foster care;

        (7) to provide the services referred to in this subsection to children who, after attaining 16 years of age, have left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption; and

        (8) to ensure children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally-appropriate activities as defined in [section 675(11) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s675/11].

These children should be enrolled in an Independent Living program designed and conducted by State and local government to help prepare them for employment, postsecondary education, and successful management of adult responsibilities.

>     “(2) Older children who continue to be in foster care as adolescents may become eligible for Independent Living programs. These Independent Living programs are not an alternative to adoption for these children. Enrollment in Independent Living programs can occur concurrent with continued efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive families for older children in foster care.

>     “(3) About 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation’s foster care system each year because they have reached 18 years of age and are expected to support themselves.

>     “(4) Congress has received extensive information that adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty making a successful transition to adulthood; this information shows that children aging out of foster care show high rates of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and delinquent or criminal behavior; they are also frequently the target of crime and physical assaults.

>     “(5) The Nation’s State and local governments, with financial support from the Federal Government, should offer an extensive program of education, training, employment, and financial support for young adults leaving foster care, with participation in such program beginning several years before high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the young adults emancipated from foster care establish independence or reach 21 years of age.”
