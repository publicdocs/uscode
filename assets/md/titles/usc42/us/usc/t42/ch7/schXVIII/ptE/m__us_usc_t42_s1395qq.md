        A hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service, whether operated by such Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are defined in [section 1603 of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s1603]), shall be eligible for payments under this subchapter, notwithstanding sections 1395f(c) and 1395n(d) of this title, if and for so long as it meets all of the conditions and requirements for such payments which are applicable generally to hospitals or skilled nursing facilities (as the case may be) under this subchapter.

    (b) __Eligibility based on submission of plan to achieve compliance with conditions and requirements; twelve-month period__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service which does not meet all of the conditions and requirements of this subchapter which are applicable generally to hospitals or skilled nursing facilities (as the case may be), but which submits to the Secretary within six months after September 30, 1976, an acceptable plan for achieving compliance with such conditions and requirements, shall be deemed to meet such conditions and requirements (and to be eligible for payments under this subchapter), without regard to the extent of its actual compliance with such conditions and requirements, during the first 12 months after the month in which such plan is submitted.

    (c) __Payments into special fund for improvements to achieve compliance with conditions and requirements; certification of compliance by Secretary__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payments to which any hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service is entitled by reason of this section shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the Secretary and used by him (to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts) exclusively for the purpose of making any improvements in the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service which may be necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of this subchapter. The preceding sentence shall cease to apply when the Secretary determines and certifies that substantially all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service in the United States are in compliance with such conditions and requirements.

    (d) __Report by Secretary; status of facilities in complying with conditions and requirements__ 

        The annual report of the Secretary which is required by [section 1671 of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s1671] shall include (along with the matters specified in [section 1643 of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s1643]) a detailed statement of the status of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of the Service in terms of their compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of this subchapter and of the progress being made by such hospitals and facilities (under plans submitted under subsection (b) of this section and otherwise) toward the achievement of such compliance.

            (B) Payment shall not be made for services under subparagraph (A) to the extent that payment is otherwise made for such services under this subchapter.
