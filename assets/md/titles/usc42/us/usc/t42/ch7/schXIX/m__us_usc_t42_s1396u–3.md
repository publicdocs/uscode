## § 1396u–3. State coverage of medicare cost-sharing for additional low-income medicare beneficiaries

    (a) __In general__ 

        A State plan under this subchapter shall provide, under [section 1396a(a)(10)(E)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/E/iv] and subject to the succeeding provisions of this section and through a plan amendment, for medical assistance for payment of the cost of medicare cost-sharing described in such section on behalf of all individuals described in such section (in this section referred to as “qualifying individuals”) who are selected to receive such assistance under subsection (b) of this section.

    (b) __Selection of qualifying individuals__ 

    A State shall select qualifying individuals, and provide such individuals with assistance, under this section consistent with the following:

        (1) __All qualifying individuals may apply__ 

            The State shall permit all qualifying individuals to apply for assistance during a calendar year.

        (2) __Selection on first-come, first-served basis__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For each calendar year (beginning with 1998), from (and to the extent of) the amount of the allocation under subsection (c) of this section for the State for the fiscal year ending in such calendar year, the State shall select qualifying individuals who apply for the assistance in the order in which they apply.

            (B) __Carryover__ 

                For calendar years after 1998, the State shall give preference to individuals who were provided such assistance (or other assistance described in [section 1396a(a)(10)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/E]) in the last month of the previous year and who continue to be (or become) qualifying individuals.

        (3) __Limit on number of individuals based on allocation__ 

            The State shall limit the number of qualifying individuals selected with respect to assistance in a calendar year so that the aggregate amount of such assistance provided to such individuals in such year is estimated to be equal to (but not exceed) the State’s allocation under subsection (c) of this section for the fiscal year ending in such calendar year.

        (4) __Receipt of assistance during duration of year__ 

            If a qualifying individual is selected to receive assistance under this section for a month in a year, the individual is entitled to receive such assistance for the remainder of the year if the individual continues to be a qualifying individual. The fact that an individual is selected to receive assistance under this section at any time during a year does not entitle the individual to continued assistance for any succeeding year.

            (B) the sum of the amounts computed under subparagraph (A) for all eligible States.

        (2) to the extent that such assistance exceeds such allocation, the Federal medical assistance percentage is 0 percent.
