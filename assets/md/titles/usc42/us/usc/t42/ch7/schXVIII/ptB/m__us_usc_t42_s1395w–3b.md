## § 1395w–3b. Competitive acquisition of outpatient drugs and biologicals

    (a) __Implementation of competitive acquisition__ 

        (1) __Implementation of program__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish and implement a competitive acquisition program under which—

                (i) competitive acquisition areas are established for contract award purposes for acquisition of and payment for categories of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals (as defined in paragraph (2)) under this part;

                (ii) each physician is given the opportunity annually to elect to obtain drugs and biologicals under the program, rather than under [section 1395w–3a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3a]; and

                (iii) each physician who elects to obtain drugs and biologicals under the program makes an annual selection under paragraph (5) of the contractor through which drugs and biologicals within a category of drugs and biologicals will be acquired and delivered to the physician under this part.

                This section shall not apply in the case of a physician who elects [section 1395w–3a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3a] to apply.

            (B) __Implementation__ 

                For purposes of implementing the program, the Secretary shall establish categories of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals. The Secretary shall phase in the program with respect to those categories beginning in 2006 in such manner as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

            (C) __Waiver of certain provisions__ 

                In order to promote competition, in carrying out the program the Secretary may waive such provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation as are necessary for the efficient implementation of this section, other than provisions relating to confidentiality of information and such other provisions as the Secretary determines appropriate.

            (D) __Exclusion authority__ 

            The Secretary may exclude competitively biddable drugs and biologicals (including a class of such drugs and biologicals) from the competitive bidding system under this section if the application of competitive bidding to such drugs or biologicals—

                (i) is not likely to result in significant savings; or

                (ii) is likely to have an adverse impact on access to such drugs or biologicals.

                The Secretary shall provide a process by which physicians submit information to contractors for purposes of the collection of any applicable deductible or coinsurance amounts under subparagraph (A)(ii).

            (D) __Post-payment review process__ 

                The Secretary shall establish (by program instruction or otherwise) a post-payment review process (which may include the use of statistical sampling) to assure that payment is made for a drug or biological under this section only if the drug or biological has been administered to a beneficiary. The Secretary shall recoup, offset, or collect any overpayments determined by the Secretary under such process.

        (4) __Contract required__
