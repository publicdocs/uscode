## § 1306a. Public access to State disbursement records

    No State or any agency or political subdivision thereof shall be deprived of any grant-in-aid or other payment to which it otherwise is or has become entitled pursuant to subchapter I (other than section 303(a)(3) thereof), IV, X, XIV, or XVI (other than section 1383(a)(3) thereof) of this chapter, by reason of the enactment or enforcement by such State of any legislation prescribing any conditions under which public access may be had to records of the disbursement of any such funds or payments within such State, if such legislation prohibits the use of any list or names obtained through such access to such records for commercial or political purposes.

([Oct. 20, 1951, ch. 521][/us/act/1951-10-20/ch521], title VI, § 618, [65 Stat. 569][/us/stat/65/569]; [Pub. L. 86–778, title VI][/us/pl/86/778/tVI], § 603(a), Sept. 13, 1960, [74 Stat. 992][/us/stat/74/992]; [Pub. L. 87–543, title I][/us/pl/87/543/tI], § 141(e), July 25, 1962, [76 Stat. 205][/us/stat/76/205].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 303(a)(3), referred to in text, was repealed by [Pub. L. 97–35, title XXI][/us/pl/97/35/tXXI], § 2184(a)(4)(A), Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 816][/us/stat/95/816].

    Section 1383(a)(3), referred to in text, was in the original a reference to section 1603(a)(3) of the Social Security Act as added July 25, 1962, [Pub. L. 87–543, title I][/us/pl/87/543/tI], § 141(a), [76 Stat. 200][/us/stat/76/200], and amended. That section was amended generally by [Pub. L. 92–603][/us/pl/92/603], § 301, Oct. 30, 1972, [86 Stat. 1478][/us/stat/86/1478]. However, the amendment by [Pub. L. 92–603][/us/pl/92/603] was inapplicable to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, so that the prior section (which is set out as a note under [section 1383 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1383]) continues in effect for Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of act Oct. 20, 1951, popularly known as the Revenue Act of 1951, and not as part of the Social Security Act which comprises this chapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–543][/us/pl/87/543] substituted “XIV, or XVI (other than section 1383(a)(3) thereof)” for “or XIV”.

    1960—[Pub. L. 86–778][/us/pl/86/778] inserted “(other than section 303(a)(3) thereof)” after “pursuant to subchapter I”.

 __Effective Date of 1960 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 86–778, title VI][/us/pl/86/778/tVI], § 603(b), Sept. 13, 1960, [74 Stat. 992][/us/stat/74/992], provided that: 

> “The amendment made by subsection (a) \[amending this section\] shall take effect October 1, 1960.”
