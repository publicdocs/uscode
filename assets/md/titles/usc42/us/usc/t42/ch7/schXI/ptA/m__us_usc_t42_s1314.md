    (b) __Membership and representation of interests on initial Council__ 

        The Council shall be appointed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service and shall consist of twelve persons who shall, to the extent possible, be representatives of employers and employees in equal numbers, representatives of State or Federal agencies concerned with the administration or financing of the public assistance and child welfare services programs, representatives of nonprofit private organizations concerned with social welfare programs, other persons with special knowledge, experience, or qualifications with respect to such programs, and members of the public.

    (c) __Technical and other assistance for initial Council; availability of data__ 

        The Council is authorized to engage such technical assistance as may be required to carry out its functions, and the Secretary shall, in addition, make available to the Council such secretarial, clerical, and other assistance and such pertinent data prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services as it may require to carry out such functions.

    (d) __Termination of initial Council’s existence on submission of report__ 

        The Council shall make a report of its findings and recommendations (including recommendations for changes in the provisions of this chapter) to the Secretary, such report to be submitted not later than July 1, 1966, after which date such Council shall cease to exist.

    (e) __Succeeding Councils; appointment; functions; membership; representation of interests; assistance and data; termination__
