            (B) equal to the percent specified in paragraph (3) of the sums expended during such quarter that are attributable to the planning, design, development, installation or enhancement of an automatic data processing and information retrieval system (including in such sums the full cost of the hardware components of such system); and  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

            except that no amount shall be paid to any State on account of amounts expended from amounts paid to the State under [section 658a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s658a] or to carry out an agreement which it has entered into pursuant to [section 663 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s663]. In determining the total amounts expended by any State during a quarter, for purposes of this subsection, there shall be excluded an amount equal to the total of any fees collected or other income resulting from services provided under the plan approved under this part.

        (3)

            (A) The Secretary shall pay to each State, for each quarter in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, 90 percent of so much of the State expenditures described in paragraph (1)(B) as the Secretary finds are for a system meeting the requirements specified in [section 654(16) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/16] (as in effect on September 30, 1995) but limited to the amount approved for States in the advance planning documents of such States submitted on or before September 30, 1995.

            (B)

                (i) The Secretary shall pay to each State or system described in clause (iii), for each quarter in fiscal years 1996 through 2001, the percentage specified in clause (ii) of so much of the State or system expenditures described in paragraph (1)(B) as the Secretary finds are for a system meeting the requirements of sections 654(16) and 654a of this title.

                (ii) The percentage specified in this clause is 80 percent.

                (iii) For purposes of clause (i), a system described in this clause is a system that has been approved by the Secretary to receive enhanced funding pursuant to the Family Support Act of 1988 ([Public Law 100–485][/us/pl/100/485]; [102 Stat. 2343][/us/stat/102/2343]) for the purpose of developing a system that meets the requirements of sections 654(16) of this title (as in effect on and after September 30, 1995) and 654a of this title, including systems that have received funding for such purpose pursuant to a waiver under [section 1315(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1315/a].

        (4)

            (A)

                (i)

                 If—

                    (I) the Secretary determines that a State plan under [section 654 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654] would (in the absence of this paragraph) be disapproved for the failure of the State to comply with a particular subparagraph of [section 654(24) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/24], and that the State has made and is continuing to make a good faith effort to so comply; and

                    (II) the State has submitted to the Secretary a corrective compliance plan that describes how, by when, and at what cost the State will achieve such compliance, which has been approved by the Secretary,

                    then the Secretary shall not disapprove the State plan under [section 654 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654], and the Secretary shall reduce the amount otherwise payable to the State under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection for the fiscal year by the penalty amount.

                (ii) All failures of a State during a fiscal year to comply with any of the requirements referred to in the same subparagraph of [section 654(24) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/24] shall be considered a single failure of the State to comply with that subparagraph during the fiscal year for purposes of this paragraph.

                (iii) The Secretary shall reduce the amount of any reduction that, in the absence of this clause, would be required to be made under this paragraph by reason of the failure of a State to achieve compliance with [section 654(24)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/24/B] during the fiscal year, by an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the otherwise required reduction, for each State performance measure described in [section 658a(b)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s658a/b/4] with respect to which the applicable percentage under [section 658a(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s658a/b/6] for the fiscal year is 100 percent, if the Secretary has made the determination described in [section 658a(b)(5)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s658a/b/5/B] with respect to the State for the fiscal year.

            (D) The Secretary may not impose a penalty under this paragraph against a State with respect to a failure to comply with [section 654(24)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/24/B] for a fiscal year if the Secretary is required to impose a penalty under this paragraph against the State with respect to a failure to comply with [section 654(24)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s654/24/A] for the fiscal year.
