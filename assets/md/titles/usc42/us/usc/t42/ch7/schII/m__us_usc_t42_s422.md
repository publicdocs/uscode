## § 422. Rehabilitation services

    (a) __, (b) Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 106–170, title I, § 101(b)(1)(B)__  __][/us/pl/106/170/s101/b/1/B]__  __, (C),__  __Dec. 17, 1999__  __,__  __[__  __113 Stat. 1873__  __][/us/stat/113/1873]__ 

    (c) __“Period of trial work” defined__ 

        (1) The term “period of trial work”, with respect to an individual entitled to benefits under section 423, 402(d), 402(e), or 402(f) of this title, means a period of months beginning and ending as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4).

        (2) For purposes of sections 416(i) and 423 of this title, any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered by such individual in determining whether his disability has ceased in a month during such period. For purposes of this subsection the term “services” means activity (whether legal or illegal) which is performed for remuneration or gain or is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be of a type normally performed for remuneration or gain.

        (3) A period of trial work for any individual shall begin with the month in which he becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits, or, in the case of an individual entitled to benefits under [section 402(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/d] who has attained the age of eighteen, with the month in which he becomes entitled to such benefits or the month in which he attains the age of eighteen, whichever is later, or, in the case of an individual entitled to widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits under section 402(e) or (f) of this title who became entitled to such benefits prior to attaining age 60, with the month in which such individual becomes so entitled. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no period of trial work may begin for any individual prior to the beginning of the month following September 1960; and no such period may begin for an individual in a period of disability of such individual in which he had a previous period of trial work.

        (4)

         A period of trial work for any individual shall end with the close of whichever of the following months is the earlier:

            (A) the ninth month, in any period of 60 consecutive months, in which the individual renders services (whether or not such nine months are consecutive); or

            (B) the month in which his disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]) ceases (as determined after application of paragraph (2) of this subsection).

        (5)

         Upon conviction by a Federal court that an individual has fraudulently concealed work activity during a period of trial work from the Commissioner of Social Security by—

            (A) providing false information to the Commissioner of Social Security as to whether the individual had earnings in or for a particular period, or as to the amount thereof;

            (B) receiving disability insurance benefits under this subchapter while engaging in work activity under another identity, including under another social security account number or a number purporting to be a social security account number; or

            (C) taking other actions to conceal work activity with an intent fraudulently to secure payment in a greater amount than is due or when no payment is authorized,

            no benefit shall be payable to such individual under this subchapter with respect to a period of disability for any month before such conviction during which the individual rendered services during the period of trial work with respect to which the fraudulently concealed work activity occurred, and amounts otherwise due under this subchapter as restitution, penalties, assessments, fines, or other repayments shall in all cases be in addition to any amounts for which such individual is liable as overpayments by reason of such concealment.

    (d) __Cost of rehabilitation services from trust funds__ 

        (1)

         For purposes of making vocational rehabilitation services more readily available to disabled individuals who are—

            (A) entitled to disability insurance benefits under [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423],

            (B) entitled to child’s insurance benefits under [section 402(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/d] after having attained age 18 (and are under a disability),

            (C) entitled to widow’s insurance benefits under [section 402(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/e] prior to attaining age 60, or

            (D) entitled to widower’s insurance benefits under [section 402(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/f] prior to attaining age 60,

            to the end that savings will accrue to the Trust Funds as a result of rehabilitating such individuals, there are authorized to be transferred from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to enable the Commissioner of Social Security to reimburse the State for the reasonable and necessary costs of vocational rehabilitation services furnished such individuals (including services during their waiting periods), under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \[[29 U.S.C. 720][/us/usc/t29/s720] et seq.\], (i) in cases where the furnishing of such services results in the performance by such individuals of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period of nine months, (ii) in cases where such individuals receive benefits as a result of [section 425(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s425/b] (except that no reimbursement under this paragraph shall be made for services furnished to any individual receiving such benefits for any period after the close of such individual’s ninth consecutive month of substantial gainful activity or the close of the month in which his or her entitlement to such benefits ceases, whichever first occurs), and (iii) in cases where such individuals, without good cause, refuse to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or fail to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude their successful rehabilitation. The determination that the vocational rehabilitation services contributed to the successful return of an individual to substantial gainful activity, the determination that an individual, without good cause, refused to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or failed to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude successful rehabilitation, and the determination of the amount of costs to be reimbursed under this subsection shall be made by the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with criteria formulated by the Commissioner.

        (2) In the case of any State which is unwilling to participate or does not have a plan which meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security may provide such services in such State by agreement or contract with other public or private agencies, organizations, institutions, or individuals. The provision of such services shall be subject to the same conditions as otherwise apply under paragraph (1).

        (3) Payments under this subsection shall be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, with necessary adjustments for overpayments and underpayments.

        (4)

         Money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection for the reimbursement of the costs of providing services to individuals who are entitled to benefits under [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423] (including services during their waiting periods), or who are entitled to benefits under [section 402(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/d] on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individuals, shall be charged to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and all other money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection shall be charged to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine according to such methods and procedures as the Commissioner may deem appropriate—

            (A) the total amount to be reimbursed for the cost of services under this subsection, and

            (B) subject to the provisions of the preceding sentence, the amount which should be charged to each of the Trust Funds.

        (5) For purposes of this subsection the term “vocational rehabilitation services” shall have the meaning assigned to it in title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \[[29 U.S.C. 720][/us/usc/t29/s720] et seq.\], except that such services may be limited in type, scope, or amount in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security designed to achieve the purpose of this subsection.

    (e) __Treatment referrals for individuals with alcoholism or drug addiction condition__ 

        In the case of any individual whose benefits under this subchapter are paid to a representative payee pursuant to [section 405(j)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s405/j/1/B], the Commissioner of Social Security shall refer such individual to the appropriate State agency administering the State plan for substance abuse treatment services approved under subpart II of part B of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act ([42 U.S.C. 300x–21][/us/usc/t42/s300x–21] et seq.).
