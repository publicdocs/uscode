            (B) __Reduction in payment if failure to maintain effort__ 

                If the amount reported under subparagraph (A) by a State with respect to a fiscal year is less than the amount reported under subparagraph (A) with respect to fiscal year 1989, the Secretary shall provide for a reduction in payments to the State under [section 1396b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a] in an amount equal to the difference between the amounts so reported.

    (i) __Survey and certification process__ 

        (1) __Certifications__ 

            (A) __Responsibilities of the State__ 

                Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of providers of home and community care and community care settings with the applicable requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section. The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.

            (B) __Responsibilities of the Secretary__ 

                The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of State providers of home and community care, and of State community care settings in which such care is provided, with the requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section.

            (C) __Frequency of certifications__ 

                Certification of providers and settings under this subsection shall occur no less frequently than once every 12 months.

        (2) __Reviews of providers__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The certification under this subsection with respect to a provider of home or community care must be based on a periodic review of the provider’s performance in providing the care required under ICCP’s in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section.

            (B) __Special reviews of compliance__ 

                Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any of the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a review of the provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.

        (3) __Surveys of community care settings__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The certification under this subsection with respect to community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such a setting must be conducted without prior notice to the setting. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a]. The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conducting such surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.

            (B) __Survey protocol__ 

                Surveys under this paragraph shall be conducted based upon a protocol which the Secretary has provided for under subsection (k) of this section.

            (C) __Prohibition of conflict of interest in survey team membership__ 

                A State and the Secretary may not use as a member of a survey team under this paragraph an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the community care setting being surveyed (or the person responsible for such setting) respecting compliance with the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) of this section or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the setting being surveyed.

            (D) __Validation surveys of community care settings__ 

                The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of community care settings in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under subparagraph (A) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an individual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the setting’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.

            (E) __Special surveys of compliance__ 

                Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets such requirements.

        (4) __Investigation of complaints and monitoring of providers and settings__ 

            Each State and the Secretary shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to investigate complaints of violations of applicable requirements imposed on providers of community care or on community care settings under subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section.

        (5) __Investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse and misappropriation of individual property__ 

            The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of providers of home or community care and community care settings under this subsection, for a process for the receipt, review, and investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse (including injuries of unknown source) by individuals providing such care or in such setting and of misappropriation of individual property by such individuals. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that an individual has neglected or abused an individual receiving community care or misappropriated such individual’s property, the State shall notify the individual against whom the finding is made. A State shall not make a finding that a person has neglected an individual receiving community care if the person demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the person. The State shall provide for public disclosure of findings under this paragraph upon request and for inclusion, in any such disclosure of such findings, of any brief statement (or of a clear and accurate summary thereof) of the individual disputing such findings.

        (6) __Disclosure of results of inspections and activities__ 

            (A) __Public information__ 

            Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public—

                (i) information respecting all surveys, reviews, and certifications made under this subsection respecting providers of home or community care and community care settings, including statements of deficiencies,

                (ii) copies of cost reports (if any) of such providers and settings filed under this subchapter,

                (iii) copies of statements of ownership under [section 1320a–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–3], and

                (iv) information disclosed under [section 1320a–5 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–5].

            (B) __Notices of substandard care__ 

            If a State finds that—

                (i) a provider of home or community care has provided care of substandard quality with respect to an individual, the State shall make a reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) an immediate family member of each such individual and (II) individuals receiving home or community care from that provider under this subchapter, or

                (ii) a community care setting is substandard, the State shall make a reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) individuals receiving community care in that setting, and (II) immediate family members of such individuals.

            (C) __Access to fraud control units__ 

                Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under [section 1396b(q) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/q]) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys, reviews, and certifications under this subsection.

    (j) __Enforcement process for providers of community care__ 

        (1) __State authority__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If a State finds, on the basis of a review under subsection (i)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a provider of home or community care no longer meets the requirements of this section, the State may terminate the provider’s participation under the State plan and may provide in addition for a civil money penalty. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a provider’s deficiencies. If the State finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A) for the period during which it finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.

            (B) __Civil money penalty__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedy: A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the provider is or was out of compliance with a requirement of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty under subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section) may be applied to reimbursement of individuals for personal funds lost due to a failure of home or community care providers to meet the requirements of this section. The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.

                (ii) __Deadline and guidance__ 

                    Each State which elects to provide home and community care under this section must establish the civil money penalty remedy described in clause (i) applicable to all providers of community care covered under this section. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations or otherwise by not later than July 1, 1990, guidance to States in establishing such remedy; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedy.

        (2) __Secretarial authority__ 

            (A) __For State providers__ 

                With respect to a State provider of home or community care, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a State under this subsection, except that the civil money penalty remedy described in subparagraph (C) shall be substituted for the civil money remedy described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).

            (B) __Other providers__ 

                With respect to any other provider of home or community care in a State, if the Secretary finds that a provider no longer meets a requirement of this section, the Secretary may terminate the provider’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C). If the Secretary finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C) for the period during which the Secretary finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.

            (C) __Civil money penalty__ 

                If the Secretary finds on the basis of a review under subsection (i)(2) of this section or otherwise that a home or community care provider no longer meets the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a]. The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.

    (k) __Secretarial responsibilities__ 

        (1) __Publication of interim requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall publish, by December 1, 1991, a proposed regulation that sets forth interim requirements, consistent with subparagraph (B), for the provision of home and community care and for community care settings, including—

                (i) the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section (relating to comprehensive functional assessments, including the use of assessment instruments), of subsection (d)(2)(E) of this section (relating to qualifications for qualified case managers), of subsection (f) of this section (relating to minimum requirements for home and community care), of subsection (g) of this section (relating to minimum requirements for small community care settings), and of subsection (h) of this section (relating to minimum requirements for large community care settings), and

                (ii) survey protocols (for use under subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section) which relate to such requirements.

            (B) __Minimum protections__ 

                Interim requirements under subparagraph (A) and final requirements under paragraph (2) shall assure, through methods other than reliance on State licensure processes, that individuals receiving home and community care are protected from neglect, physical and sexual abuse, financial exploitation, inappropriate involuntary restraint, and the provision of health care services by unqualified personnel in community care settings.

        (2) __Development of final requirements__ 

        The Secretary shall develop, by not later than October 1, 1992—

            (A) final requirements, consistent with paragraph (1)(B), respecting the provision of appropriate, quality home and community care and respecting community care settings under this section, and including at least the requirements referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), and

            (B) survey protocols and methods for evaluating and assuring the quality of community care settings.

            The Secretary may, from time to time, revise such requirements, protocols, and methods.

        (3) __No delegation to States__ 

            The Secretary’s authority under this subsection shall not be delegated to States.

        (4) __No prevention of more stringent requirements by States__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing States from imposing requirements that are more stringent than the requirements published or developed by the Secretary under this subsection.

    (l) __Waiver of Statewideness__ 

        States may waive the requirement of [section 1396a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/1] (related to Statewideness) for a program of home and community care under this section.

    (m) __Limitation on amount of expenditures as medical assistance__ 

        (1) __Limitation on amount__ 

            The amount of funds that may be expended as medical assistance to carry out the purposes of this section shall be for fiscal year 1991, $40,000,000, for fiscal year 1992, $70,000,000, for fiscal year 1993, $130,000,000, for fiscal year 1994, $160,000,000, and for fiscal year 1995, $180,000,000.

        (2) __Assurance of entitlement to service__ 

            A State which receives Federal medical assistance for expenditures for home and community care under this section must provide home and community care specified under the Individual Community Care Plan under subsection (d) of this section to individuals described in subsection (b) of this section for the duration of the election period, without regard to the amount of funds available to the State under paragraph (1). For purposes of this paragraph, an election period is the period of 4 or more calendar quarters elected by the State, and approved by the Secretary, for the provision of home and community care under this section.

        (3) __Limitation on eligibility__ 

            The State may limit eligibility for home and community care under this section during an election period under paragraph (2) to reasonable classifications (based on age, degree of functional disability, and need for services).

        (4) __Allocation of medical assistance__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a limitation on the amount of Federal medical assistance available to any State during the State’s election period under paragraph (2). The limitation under this paragraph shall take into account the limitation under paragraph (1) and the number of elderly individuals age 65 or over residing in such State in relation to the number of such elderly individuals in the United States during 1990. For purposes of the previous sentence, elderly individuals shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be low-income elderly individuals.
