The State may waive payment of any such premium in any case where the State determines that requiring such payment would create an undue hardship.

        (4) A State may permit State or local funds available under other programs to be used for payment of a premium imposed under paragraph (1). Payment of a premium with such funds shall not be counted as income to the individual with respect to whom such payment is made.

        With respect to a qualified disabled and working individual described in [section 1396d(s) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/s] whose income (as determined under paragraph (3) of that section) exceeds 150 percent of the official poverty line referred to in that paragraph, the State plan of a State may provide for the charging of a premium (expressed as a percentage of the medicare cost-sharing described in [section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/p/3/A/i] provided with respect to the individual) according to a sliding scale under which such percentage increases from 0 percent to 100 percent, in reasonable increments (as determined by the Secretary), as the individual’s income increases from 150 percent of such poverty line to 200 percent of such poverty line.

    (e) __Prohibition of denial of services on basis of individual’s inability to pay certain charges__ 

        The State plan shall require that no provider participating under the State plan may deny care or services to an individual eligible for such care or services under the plan on account of such individual’s inability to pay a deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge.

    No deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge may be imposed under any waiver authority of the Secretary, except as provided in subsections (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this section and section 1396o–1 of this title, unless such waiver is for a demonstration project which the Secretary finds after public notice and opportunity for comment—

        (1) will test a unique and previously untested use of copayments,

        (2) is limited to a period of not more than two years,

        (3) will provide benefits to recipients of medical assistance which can reasonably be expected to be equivalent to the risks to the recipients,

        (4) is based on a reasonable hypothesis which the demonstration is designed to test in a methodologically sound manner, including the use of control groups of similar recipients of medical assistance in the area, and

        (5) is voluntary, or makes provision for assumption of liability for preventable damage to the health of recipients of medical assistance resulting from involuntary participation.

        (1)

         a State may (in a uniform manner for individuals described in either such subclause)—

            (A) require such individuals to pay premiums or other cost-sharing charges set on a sliding scale based on income that the State may determine; and

            (B) require payment of 100 percent of such premiums for such year in the case of such an individual who has income for a year that exceeds 250 percent of the income official poverty line (referred to in subsection (c)(1) of this section) applicable to a family of the size involved, except that in the case of such an individual who has income for a year that does not exceed 450 percent of such poverty line, such requirement may only apply to the extent such premiums do not exceed 7.5 percent of such income; and

        (2) such State shall require payment of 100 percent of such premiums for a year by such an individual whose adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) for such year exceeds $75,000, except that a State may choose to subsidize such premiums by using State funds which may not be federally matched under this subchapter.

        In the case of any calendar year beginning after 2000, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (2) shall be increased in accordance with the provisions of [section 415(i)(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s415/i/2/A/ii].

    (h) __Indexing nominal cost sharing__

    (i) __State option to impose income-related premiums for families of disabled children__ 

        (1) With respect to disabled children provided medical assistance under [section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/A/ii/XIX], subject to paragraph (2), a State may (in a uniform manner for such children) require the families of such children to pay monthly premiums set on a sliding scale based on family income.

        (2)

         A premium requirement imposed under paragraph (1) may only apply to the extent that—

            (A)

             in the case of a disabled child described in that paragraph whose family income—

                (i) does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line, the aggregate amount of such premium and any premium that the parent is required to pay for family coverage under [section 1396a(cc)(2)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/cc/2/A/i] and other cost-sharing charges do not exceed 5 percent of the family’s income; and

            (B) the requirement is imposed consistent with [section 1396a(cc)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/cc/2/A/ii/I].
