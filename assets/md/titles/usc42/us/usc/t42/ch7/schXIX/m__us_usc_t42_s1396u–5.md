            (B) inform the Secretary of such determinations in cases in which such eligibility is established; and

        (3) __Screening for eligibility, and enrollment of, beneficiaries for medicare cost-sharing__ 

            As part of making an eligibility determination required under paragraph (2) for an individual, the State shall make a determination of the individual’s eligibility for medical assistance for any medicare cost-sharing described in [section 1396d(p)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/p/3] and, if the individual is eligible for any such medicare cost-sharing, offer enrollment to the individual under the State plan (or under a waiver of such plan).

                    (I) use data from the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) and other available data;

            (C) __Weighted average__ 

            The weighted average under subparagraph (A) shall be determined taking into account—

                (i) with respect to subparagraph (A)(i), the average number of full-benefit dual eligible individuals in 2003 who are not described in clause (ii); and

                (ii) with respect to subparagraph (A)(ii), the average number of full-benefit dual eligible individuals in such year who received in 2003 medical assistance for covered outpatient drugs through a medicaid managed care plan.

            (A) each of 2004, 2005, and 2006, is the average annual percent change (to that year from the previous year) of the per capita amount of prescription drug expenditures (as determined based on the most recent National Health Expenditure projections for the years involved); and

            (B) a succeeding year, is the annual percentage increase specified in [section 1395w–102(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–102/b/6] for the year.

        (6) __Full-benefit dual eligible individual defined__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “full-benefit dual eligible individual” means for a State for a month an individual who—

(c)(1) by inserting “subject to subsection (e) of this section” after “[section 1396b(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/1]”, was executed by making the insertion after “[section 1396b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a]” in subpar.
