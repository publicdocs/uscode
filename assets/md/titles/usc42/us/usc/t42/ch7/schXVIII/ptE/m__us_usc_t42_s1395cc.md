In the case of items and services described in section 1395l(c) of this title, clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting for 20 percent the proportion which is appropriate under such section. A provider of services may not impose a charge under clause (ii) of the first sentence of this subparagraph with respect to items and services described in [section 1395x(s)(10)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/s/10/A] and with respect to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for which payment is made under part B of this subchapter. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, a home health agency may charge such an individual or person, with respect to covered items subject to payment under [section 1395m(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/a], the amount of any deduction imposed under section 1395l(b) of this title and 20 percent of the payment basis described in [section 1395m(a)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/a/1/B].

In the case of services described in section 1395l(a)(8) of this title or section 1395l(a)(9) of this title for which payment is made under part B of this subchapter under [section 1395m(k) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/k], clause (ii) of the first sentence shall be applied by substituting for 20 percent of the reasonable charge for such services 20 percent of the lesser of the actual charge or the applicable fee schedule amount (as defined in such section) for such services.

            (B) Where a provider of services has furnished, at the request of such individual, items or services which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services with respect to which payment may be made under this subchapter, such provider of services may also charge such individual or other person for such more expensive items or services to the extent that the amount customarily charged by it for the items or services furnished at such request exceeds the amount customarily charged by it for the items or services with respect to which payment may be made under this subchapter.

            (C) A provider of services may in accordance with its customary practice also appropriately charge any such individual for any whole blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as defined under regulations) furnished him with respect to which a deductible is imposed under [section 1395e(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395e/a/2], except that (i) any excess of such charge over the cost to such provider for the blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as so defined) shall be deducted from any payment to such provider under this subchapter, (ii) no such charge may be imposed for the cost of administration of such blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as so defined), and (iii) such charge may not be made to the extent such blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as so defined) has been replaced on behalf of such individual or arrangements have been made for its replacement on his behalf. For purposes of this subparagraph, whole blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as so defined) furnished an individual shall be deemed replaced when the provider of services is given one pint of blood for each pint of blood (or equivalent quantities of packed red blood cells, as so defined) furnished such individual with respect to which a deduction is imposed under [section 1395e(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395e/a/2].

            (D) Where a provider of services customarily furnishes items or services which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services with respect to which payment may be made under this subchapter, such provider, notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, may not, under the authority of subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph, charge any individual or other person any amount for such items or services in excess of the amount of the payment which may otherwise be made for such items or services under this subchapter if the admitting physician has a direct or indirect financial interest in such provider.

        (3)

            (A) Under the agreement required under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), the quality improvement organization must perform functions (other than those covered under an agreement under paragraph (1)(F)(i)) under the third sentence of [section 1320c–3(a)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320c–3/a/4/A] and under [section 1320c–3(a)(14) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320c–3/a/14] with respect to services, furnished by the hospital, critical access hospital, facility, or agency involved, for which payment may be made under this subchapter.

            (B) For purposes of payment under this subchapter, the cost of such an agreement to the hospital, critical access hospital, facility, or agency shall be considered a cost incurred by such hospital, critical access hospital, facility, or agency in providing covered services under this subchapter and shall be paid directly by the Secretary to the quality improvement organization on behalf of such hospital, critical access hospital, facility, or agency in accordance with a schedule established by the Secretary.

            (C)

             Such payments—

                (i) shall be transferred in appropriate proportions from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, without regard to amounts appropriated in advance in appropriation Acts, in the same manner as transfers are made for payment for services provided directly to beneficiaries, and

                (ii)

                 shall not be less in the aggregate for a fiscal year—

                    (I) in the case of hospitals, than the amount specified in paragraph (1)(F)(i)(III), and

                    (II) in the case of facilities, critical access hospitals, and agencies, than the amounts the Secretary determines to be sufficient to cover the costs of such organizations’ conducting the activities described in subparagraph (A) with respect to such facilities, critical access hospitals, or agencies under part B of subchapter XI of this chapter.

    (b) __Termination or nonrenewal of agreements__ 

        (1) A provider of services may terminate an agreement with the Secretary under this section at such time and upon such notice to the Secretary and the public as may be provided in regulations, except that notice of more than six months shall not be required.

        (2)

         The Secretary may refuse to enter into an agreement under this section or, upon such reasonable notice to the provider and the public as may be specified in regulations, may refuse to renew or may terminate such an agreement after the Secretary—

            (A) has determined that the provider fails to comply substantially with the provisions of the agreement, with the provisions of this subchapter and regulations thereunder, or with a corrective action required under [section 1395ww(f)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/f/2/B],

            (B) has determined that the provider fails substantially to meet the applicable provisions of [section 1395x of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x],

            (D) has ascertained that the provider has been convicted of a felony under Federal or State law for an offense which the Secretary determines is detrimental to the best interests of the program or program beneficiaries.

        (3) A termination of an agreement or a refusal to renew an agreement under this subsection shall become effective on the same date and in the same manner as an exclusion from participation under the programs under this subchapter becomes effective under [section 1320a–7(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7/c].

        (4)

            (A) A hospital that fails to comply with the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(V) of this section (relating to the Bloodborne Pathogens standard) is subject to a civil money penalty in an amount described in subparagraph (B), but is not subject to termination of an agreement under this section.

            (B) The amount referred to in subparagraph (A) is an amount that is similar to the amount of civil penalties that may be imposed under section 17 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \[[29 U.S.C. 666][/us/usc/t29/s666]\] for a violation of the Bloodborne Pathogens standard referred to in subsection (a)(1)(U)  <sup>\[5\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 5 So in original. Probably should be subsection “(a)(1)(V)”. </sup></sup>  of this section by a hospital that is subject to the provisions of such Act \[[29 U.S.C. 651][/us/usc/t29/s651] et seq.\].

            (C) A civil money penalty under this paragraph shall be imposed and collected in the same manner as civil money penalties under subsection (a) of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] are imposed and collected under that section.

    (c) __Refiling after termination or nonrenewal; agreements with skilled nursing facilities__ 

        (1) Where the Secretary has terminated or has refused to renew an agreement under this subchapter with a provider of services, such provider may not file another agreement under this subchapter unless the Secretary finds that the reason for the termination or nonrenewal has been removed and that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.

        (2) Where the Secretary has terminated or has refused to renew an agreement under this subchapter with a provider of services, the Secretary shall promptly notify each State agency which administers or supervises the administration of a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter of such termination or nonrenewal.

    (d) __Decision to withhold payment for failure to review long-stay cases__ 

        If the Secretary finds that there is a substantial failure to make timely review in accordance with [section 1395x(k) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/k] of long-stay cases in a hospital, he may, in lieu of terminating his agreement with such hospital, decide that, with respect to any individual admitted to such hospital after a subsequent date specified by him, no payment shall be made under this subchapter for inpatient hospital services (including inpatient psychiatric hospital services) after the 20th day of a continuous period of such services. Such decision may be made effective only after such notice to the hospital and to the public, as may be prescribed by regulations, and its effectiveness shall terminate when the Secretary finds that the reason therefor has been removed and that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur. The Secretary shall not make any such decision except after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the institution or agency affected thereby.
