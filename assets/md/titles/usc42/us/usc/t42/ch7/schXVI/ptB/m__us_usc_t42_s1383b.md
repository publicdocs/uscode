    (c) __Notification of review__ 

        (1) In any case in which the Commissioner of Social Security initiates a review under this subchapter, similar to the continuing disability reviews authorized for purposes of subchapter II of this chapter under [section 421(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s421/i], the Commissioner of Social Security shall notify the individual whose case is to be reviewed in the same manner as required under [section 421(i)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s421/i/4].

    (d) __Regulations regarding completion of plans for achieving self-support__ 

    The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish by regulation criteria for time limits and other criteria related to individuals’ plans for achieving self-support, that take into account—

        (2) other factors determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be appropriate.

    (e) __Review of State agency blindness and disability determinations__ 

        (1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall review determinations, made by State agencies pursuant to subsection (a) in connection with applications for benefits under this subchapter on the basis of blindness or disability, that individuals who have attained 18 years of age are blind or disabled as of a specified onset date. The Commissioner of Social Security shall review such a determination before any action is taken to implement the determination.

        (2)
