        (6) the appropriate use of culturally and ethnically sensitive health care delivery; and

    (c) __Administration by contract__

The criteria employed under the demonstration program under this section to evaluate outcomes and determine best practice guidelines and incentives shall not be used as a basis for the denial of medicare benefits under the demonstration program to patients against their wishes (or if the patient is incompetent, against the wishes of the patient’s surrogate) on the basis of the patient’s age or expected length of life or of the patient’s present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency, or quality of life.

            (D) the implementation of activities to encourage the coordination and integration of medical service delivery; and

            (E) the implementation of activities to measure and document the financial impact on the health care marketplace of altering the incentives of health care delivery and changing the allocation of resources; and

        (3) meet such other requirements as the Secretary may establish.

    (e) __Waiver authority__ 

        The Secretary may waive such requirements of this subchapter and subchapter XI of this chapter as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the demonstration program established under this section.

    (f) __Budget neutrality__ 

        With respect to the period of the demonstration program under subsection (b) of this section, the aggregate expenditures under this subchapter for such period shall not exceed the aggregate expenditures that would have been expended under this subchapter if the program established under this section had not been implemented.

    (g) __Notice requirements__ 

        In the case of an individual that receives health care items or services under a demonstration program carried out under this section, the Secretary shall ensure that such individual is notified of any waivers of coverage or payment rules that are applicable to such individual under this subchapter as a result of the participation of the individual in such program.

    (h) __Participation and support by Federal agencies__ 

    In carrying out the demonstration program under this section, the Secretary may direct—

        (1) the Director of the National Institutes of Health to expand the efforts of the Institutes to evaluate current medical technologies and improve the foundation for evidence-based practice;
