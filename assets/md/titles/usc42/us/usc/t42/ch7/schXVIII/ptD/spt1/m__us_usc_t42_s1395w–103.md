## § 1395w–103. Access to a choice of qualified prescription drug coverage

    (a) __Assuring access to a choice of coverage__ 

        (1) __Choice of at least two plans in each area__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that each part D eligible individual has available, consistent with paragraph (2), a choice of enrollment in at least 2 qualifying plans (as defined in paragraph (3)) in the area in which the individual resides, at least one of which is a prescription drug plan. In any such case in which such plans are not available, the part D eligible individual shall be given the opportunity to enroll in a fallback prescription drug plan.

        (2) __Requirement for different plan sponsors__ 

            The requirement in paragraph (1) is not satisfied with respect to an area if only one entity offers all the qualifying plans in the area.

        (3) __Qualifying plan defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualifying plan” means—

            (A) a prescription drug plan; or

            (B)

             an MA–PD plan described in [section 1395w–21(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/a/2/A/i] that provides—

                (i) basic prescription drug coverage; or

                (ii) qualified prescription drug coverage that provides supplemental prescription drug coverage so long as there is no MA monthly supplemental beneficiary premium applied under the plan, due to the application of a credit against such premium of a rebate under [section 1395w–24(b)(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–24/b/1/C].

    (b) __Flexibility in risk assumed and application of fallback plan__ 

    In order to ensure access pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in an area—

        (1) the Secretary may approve limited risk plans under [section 1395w–111(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–111/f] for the area; and

        (2) only if such access is still not provided in the area after applying paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide for the offering of a fallback prescription drug plan for that area under [section 1395w–111(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–111/g].
