        (2) __Condition__ 

            An individual is not a PACE program eligible individual (with respect to payment under this section) unless the individual’s health status has been determined by the Secretary or the State administering agency, in accordance with regulations, to be comparable to the health status of individuals who have participated in the PACE demonstration waiver programs. Such determination shall be based upon information on health status and related indicators (such as medical diagnoses and measures of activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and cognitive impairment) that are part of a uniform minimum data set collected by PACE providers on potential PACE program eligible individuals.

        (3) __Annual eligibility recertifications__

            (B) __Exception__ 

                The requirement of annual reevaluation under subparagraph (A) may be waived during a period in accordance with regulations in those cases where the State administering agency determines that there is no reasonable expectation of improvement or significant change in an individual’s condition during the period because of the severity of chronic condition, or degree of impairment of functional capacity of the individual involved.

        (4) __Continuation of eligibility__ 

            An individual who is a PACE program eligible individual may be deemed to continue to be such an individual notwithstanding a determination that the individual no longer meets the requirement of subsection (a)(5)(B) of this section if, in accordance with regulations, in the absence of continued coverage under a PACE program the individual reasonably would be expected to meet such requirement within the succeeding 6-month period.

        (5) __Enrollment; disenrollment__ 

            (A) __Voluntary disenrollment at any time__ 

                The enrollment and disenrollment of PACE program eligible individuals in a PACE program shall be pursuant to regulations and the PACE program agreement and shall permit enrollees to voluntarily disenroll without cause at any time.

            (B) __Limitations on disenrollment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Regulations promulgated by the Secretary under this section and [section 1396u–4 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–4], and the PACE program agreement, shall provide that the PACE program may not disenroll a PACE program eligible individual except—

                    (I) for nonpayment of premiums (if applicable) on a timely basis; or

                    (II) for engaging in disruptive or threatening behavior, as defined in such regulations (developed in close consultation with State administering agencies).

                (ii) __No disenrollment for noncompliant behavior__ 

                    Except as allowed under regulations promulgated to carry out clause (i)(II), a PACE program may not disenroll a PACE program eligible individual on the ground that the individual has engaged in noncompliant behavior if such behavior is related to a mental or physical condition of the individual. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “noncompliant behavior” includes repeated noncompliance with medical advice and repeated failure to appear for appointments.

                (iii) __Timely review of proposed nonvoluntary disenrollment__ 

                    A proposed disenrollment, other than a voluntary disenrollment, shall be subject to timely review and final determination by the Secretary or by the State administering agency (as applicable), prior to the proposed disenrollment becoming effective.

    (d) __Payments to PACE providers on capitated basis__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of a PACE provider with a PACE program agreement under this section, except as provided in this subsection or by regulations, the Secretary shall make prospective monthly payments of a capitation amount for each PACE program eligible individual enrolled under the agreement under this section in the same manner and from the same sources as payments are made to a Medicare+ÐChoice organization under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] (or, for periods beginning before January 1, 1999, to an eligible organization under a risk-sharing contract under [section 1395mm of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395mm]). Such payments shall be subject to adjustment in the manner described in [section 1395w–23(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23/a/2] or [section 1395mm(a)(1)(E) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395mm/a/1/E], as the case may be.

        (2) __Capitation amount__ 

            The capitation amount to be applied under this subsection for a provider for a contract year shall be an amount specified in the PACE program agreement for the year. Such amount shall be based upon payment rates established for purposes of payment under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] (or, for periods before January 1, 1999, for purposes of risk-sharing contracts under [section 1395mm of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395mm]) and shall be adjusted to take into account the comparative frailty of PACE enrollees and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Such amount under such an agreement shall be computed in a manner so that the total payment level for all PACE program eligible individuals enrolled under a program is less than the projected payment under this subchapter for a comparable population not enrolled under a PACE program.

        (3) __Capitation rates determined without regard to the phase-out of the indirect costs of medical education from the annual Medicare Advantage capitation rate__ 

            Capitation amounts under this subsection shall be determined without regard to the application of [section 1395w–23(k)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23/k/4].

    (e) __PACE program agreement__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary, in close cooperation with the State administering agency, shall establish procedures for entering into, extending, and terminating PACE program agreements for the operation of PACE programs by entities that meet the requirements for a PACE provider under this section, [section 1396u–4 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–4], and regulations.

                    (I) 40 as of August 5, 1997; or

                    (II) as of each succeeding anniversary of August 5, 1997, the numerical limitation under this subparagraph for the preceding year plus 20.

                 Subclause (II) shall apply without regard to the actual number of agreements in effect as of a previous anniversary date.

                (ii) __Treatment of certain private, for-profit providers__ 

                The numerical limitation in clause (i) shall not apply to a PACE provider that—

                    (I) is operating under a demonstration project waiver under subsection (h) of this section; or

                    (II) was operating under such a waiver and subsequently qualifies for PACE provider status pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(B)(ii) of this section.

        (2) __Service area and eligibility__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            A PACE program agreement for a PACE program—

                (i) shall designate the service area of the program;

                (ii) may provide additional requirements for individuals to qualify as PACE program eligible individuals with respect to the program;

                In designating a service area under a PACE program agreement under subparagraph (A)(i), the Secretary (in consultation with the State administering agency) may exclude from designation an area that is already covered under another PACE program agreement, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of services and avoid impairing the financial and service viability of an existing program.

        (3) __Data collection; development of outcome measures__ 

            (A) __Data collection__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Under a PACE program agreement, the PACE provider shall—
