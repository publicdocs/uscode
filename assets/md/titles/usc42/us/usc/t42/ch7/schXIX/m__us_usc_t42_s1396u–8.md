## § 1396u–8. Health opportunity accounts

    (a) __Authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish a demonstration program under which States may provide under their State plans under this subchapter (including such a plan operating under a statewide waiver under [section 1315 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1315]) in accordance with this section for the provision of alternative benefits consistent with subsection (c) for eligible population groups in one or more geographic areas of the State specified by the State. An amendment under the previous sentence is referred to in this section as a “State demonstration program”.

        (2) __Initial demonstration__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The demonstration program under this section shall begin on January 1, 2007. During the first 5 years of such program, the Secretary shall not approve more than 10 States to conduct demonstration programs under this section, with each State demonstration program covering 1 or more geographic areas specified by the State. After such 5-year period—

                (i) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended or made permanent in the State; and

                (ii) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration programs.

            (B) __GAO report__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Not later than 3 months after the end of the 5-year period described in subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the demonstration programs conducted under this section during such period.

                (ii) __Appropriation__ 

                    Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated to the Comptroller General of the United States, $550,000 for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2010 to carry out clause (i).

        (3) __Approval__ 

        The Secretary shall not approve a State demonstration program under paragraph (1) unless the program includes the following:

            (A) Creating patient awareness of the high cost of medical care.

            (B) Providing incentives to patients to seek preventive care services.

            (C) Reducing inappropriate use of health care services.

            (D) Enabling patients to take responsibility for health outcomes.

            (E) Providing enrollment counselors and ongoing education activities.

            (F) Providing transactions involving health opportunity accounts to be conducted electronically and without cash.

            (G) Providing access to negotiated provider payment rates consistent with this section.

            Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a State demonstration program from providing incentives for patients obtaining appropriate preventive care (as defined for purposes of section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.

        (4) __No requirement for statewideness__ 

            Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall be construed to require that a State must provide for the implementation of a State demonstration program on a Statewide  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized. </sup></sup>  basis.

    (b) __Eligible population groups__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A State demonstration program under this section shall specify the eligible population groups consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3).

        (2) __Eligibility limitations during initial demonstration period__ 

        During the initial 5 years of the demonstration program under this section, a State demonstration program shall not apply to any of the following individuals:

            (A) Individuals who are 65 years of age or older.

            (B) Individuals who are disabled, regardless of whether or not their eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter is based on such disability.

            (C) Individuals who are eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter only because they are (or were within the previous 60 days) pregnant.

            (D) Individuals who have been eligible for medical assistance for a continuous period of less than 3 months.

        (3) __Additional limitations__ 

            A State demonstration program shall not apply to any individual within a category of individuals described in [section 1396u–7(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–7/a/2/B].

        (4) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __State option__ 

                This subsection shall not be construed as preventing a State from further limiting eligibility.

            (B) __On enrollees in Medicaid managed care organizations__ 

            Insofar as the State provides for eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, such individuals may participate in the State demonstration program only if the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the following conditions are met with respect to any such organization:

                (i) In no case may the number of such individuals enrolled in the organization who participate in the program exceed 5 percent of the total number of individuals enrolled in such organization.

                (ii) The proportion of enrollees in the organization who so participate is not significantly disproportionate to the proportion of such enrollees in other such organizations who participate.

                (iii) The State has provided for an appropriate adjustment in the per capita payments to the organization to account for such participation, taking into account differences in the likely use of health services between enrollees who so participate and enrollees who do not so participate.

        (5) __Voluntary participation__ 

            An eligible individual shall be enrolled in a State demonstration program only if the individual voluntarily enrolls. Except in such hardship cases as the Secretary shall specify, such an enrollment shall be effective for a period of 12 months, but may be extended for additional periods of 12 months each with the consent of the individual.

        (6) __1-year moratorium for reenrollment__ 

            An eligible individual who, for any reason, is disenrolled from a State demonstration program conducted under this section shall not be permitted to reenroll in such program before the end of the 1-year period that begins on the effective date of such disenrollment.

    (c) __Alternative benefits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The alternative benefits provided under this section shall consist, consistent with this subsection, of at least—

            (A) coverage for medical expenses in a year for items and services for which benefits are otherwise provided under this subchapter after an annual deductible described in paragraph (2) has been met; and

            (B) contribution into a health opportunity account.

            Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as preventing a State from providing for coverage of preventive care (referred to in subsection (a)(3)) within the alternative benefits without regard to the annual deductible.

        (2) __Annual deductible__ 

            The amount of the annual deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100 percent, but no more than 110 percent, of the annualized amount of contributions to the health opportunity account under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), determined without regard to any limitation described in subsection (d)(2)(C)(i)(II).

        (3) __Access to negotiated provider payment rates__ 

            (A) __Fee-for-service enrollees__ 

            In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and who is not enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall provide that the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from—

                (i) any participating provider under this subchapter at the same payment rates that would be applicable to such services if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable; or

                (ii) any other provider at payment rates that do not exceed 125 percent of the payment rate that would be applicable to such services furnished by a participating provider under this subchapter if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable.

            (B) __Treatment under medicaid managed care plans__ 

                In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and is enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall enter into an arrangement with the organization under which the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from any provider described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) at payment rates that do not exceed the payment rates that may be imposed under that clause.

            (C) __Computation__ 

                The payment rates described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be computed without regard to any cost sharing that would be otherwise applicable under sections 1396o and 1396o–1 of this title.

            (D) __Definitions__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph:

                (i) The term “demonstration program Medicaid services” means, with respect to an individual participating in a State demonstration program, services for which the individual would be provided medical assistance under this subchapter but for the application of the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A).

            The provisions of this subchapter relating to cost sharing for benefits (including sections 1396o and 1396o–1 of this title) shall not apply with respect to benefits to which the annual deductible under paragraph (1)(A) applies. The provisions of [section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/B] (relating to comparability) shall not apply with respect to the provision of alternative benefits (as described in this subsection).

        (6) __Treatment as medical assistance__ 

            Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (E) of subsection (d)(2), payments for alternative benefits under this section (including contributions into a health opportunity account) shall be treated as medical assistance for purposes of [section 1396b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a].

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Maximum out-of-pocket cost sharing__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the term “maximum out-of-pocket cost sharing” means, for an individual or family, the amount by which the annual deductible level applied under paragraph (1)(A) to the individual or family exceeds the balance in the health opportunity account for the individual or family.

        (8) __Contributions by employers__

                (ii) __Indexing of dollar limitations__

                In applying clause (i), a State may restrict payment for—

                    (I) providers of items and services to providers that are licensed or otherwise authorized under State law to provide the item or service and may deny payment for such a provider on the basis that the provider has been found, whether with respect to this subchapter or any other health benefit program, to have failed to meet quality standards or to have committed 1 or more acts of fraud or abuse; and

                    (II) items and services insofar as the State finds they are not medically appropriate or necessary.
