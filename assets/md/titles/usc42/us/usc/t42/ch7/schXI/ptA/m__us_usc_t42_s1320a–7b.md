        (3) having knowledge of the occurrence of any event affecting (A) his initial or continued right to any such benefit or payment, or (B) the initial or continued right to any such benefit or payment of any other individual in whose behalf he has applied for or is receiving such benefit or payment, conceals or fails to disclose such event with an intent fraudulently to secure such benefit or payment either in a greater amount or quantity than is due or when no such benefit or payment is authorized,

        (4) having made application to receive any such benefit or payment for the use and benefit of another and having received it, knowingly and willfully converts such benefit or payment or any part thereof to a use other than for the use and benefit of such other person,

        (5) presents or causes to be presented a claim for a physician’s service for which payment may be made under a Federal health care program and knows that the individual who furnished the service was not licensed as a physician, or

        (6) for a fee knowingly and willfully counsels or assists an individual to dispose of assets (including by any transfer in trust) in order for the individual to become eligible for medical assistance under a State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter, if disposing of the assets results in the imposition of a period of ineligibility for such assistance under [section 1396p(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396p/c],

        shall (i) in the case of such a statement, representation, concealment, failure, or conversion by any person in connection with the furnishing (by that person) of items or services for which payment is or may be made under the program, be guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years or both, or (ii) in the case of such a statement, representation, concealment, failure, conversion, or provision of counsel or assistance by any other person, be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Public Health Service Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(D), is [act July 1, 1944, ch. 373][/us/act/1944-07-01/ch373], [58 Stat. 682][/us/stat/58/682], as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 6A (§ 201 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 201 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s201] and Tables.

    Section 14(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(E), is [section 14(a) of Pub. L. 100–93][/us/pl/100/93/s14/a], which is set out below.

    [Section 1395w–104(e)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–104/e/6], referred to in subsec. (b)(3)(E), was in the original “section 1860D–3(e)(6)”, and was translated as reading “section 1860D–4(e)(6)” to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 1860D–3, which is classified to [section 1395w–103 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–103], does not contain a subsec. (e), and section 1395w–104(e)(6) relates to regulations.

 __Codification__ 

    Prior to redesignation by [Pub. L. 100–93][/us/pl/100/93], subsecs. (a) to (d) of this section were subsecs. (a) to (d) of section 1909 of act Aug. 14, 1935, which was classified to [section 1396h of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396h], and subsec. (e) of this section was subsec. (d) of section 1877 of act Aug. 14, 1935, which was classified to [section 1395nn of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395nn].

 __Amendments__

    2010—Subsec. (b)(3)(G). [Pub. L. 111–148, § 3301(d)(1)(A)][/us/pl/111/148/s3301/d/1/A], struck out “and” at the end.

    Subsec. (b)(3)(H). [Pub. L. 111–148, § 3301(d)(1)(B)][/us/pl/111/148/s3301/d/1/B], amended subpar. (H) relating to remuneration between a federally qualified health center and an MA organization by substituting a semicolon for the period at the end and realigning margins.

(H) relating to remuneration between a health center entity and any individual or entity providing goods, items, services, donations, loans, or a combination thereof, to such health center entity as (I) and realigned margins.

    Subsec. (b)(3)(J). [Pub. L. 111–148, § 3301(d)(1)(C)(iii)][/us/pl/111/148/s3301/d/1/C/iii], (D), added subpar. (J).

(C) by inserting “or in regulations under [section 1395w–104(e)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–104/e/6]” after “1987”, was executed by making the insertion in subpar.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 105–33, § 4201(c)(1)][/us/pl/105/33/s4201/c/1], substituted “critical access” for “rural primary care”.

    Subsec. (d)(1). [Pub. L. 105–33, § 4704(b)][/us/pl/105/33/s4704/b], inserted “(or, in the case of services provided to an individual enrolled with a medicaid managed care organization under subchapter XIX of this chapter under a contract under [section 1396b(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/m] or under a contractual, referral, or other arrangement under such contract, at a rate in excess of the rate permitted under such contract)” after “by the State”.

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–191, § 204(a)(1)][/us/pl/104/191/s204/a/1], substituted “Federal” for “Medicare or State” in section catchline.

    Subsec. (a). [Pub.

    Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 104–191, § 204(a)(2)][/us/pl/104/191/s204/a/2], substituted “a Federal health care program (as defined in subsection (f) of this section)” for “a program under subchapter XVIII of this chapter or a State health care program (as defined in [section 1320a–7(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7/h])”.
