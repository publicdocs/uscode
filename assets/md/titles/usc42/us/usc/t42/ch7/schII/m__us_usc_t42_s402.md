            (C)

                (i) An “elementary or secondary school” is a school which provides elementary or secondary education, respectively, as determined under the law of the State or other jurisdiction in which it is located.

                (ii) For the purpose of determining whether a child is a “full-time elementary or secondary school student” or “intends to continue to be in full-time attendance at an elementary or secondary school”, within the meaning of this subsection, there shall be disregarded any education provided, or to be provided, beyond grade 12.

            (D) A child who attains age 19 at a time when he is a full-time elementary or secondary school student (as defined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and without application of subparagraph (B) of such paragraph) but has not (at such time) completed the requirements for, or received, a diploma or equivalent certificate from a secondary school (as defined in subparagraph (C)(i)) shall be deemed (for purposes of determining whether his entitlement to benefits under this subsection has terminated under paragraph (1)(F) and for purposes of determining his initial entitlement to such benefits under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(B)) not to have attained such age until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which he is enrolled at such time (or, if the elementary or secondary school (as defined in this paragraph) in which he is enrolled is not operated on a quarter or semester system, until the first day of the first month following the completion of the course in which he is so enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning after such time, whichever first occurs).

            (B) an individual entitled to disability insurance benefits, or an individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits who was entitled to disability insurance benefits for the month preceding the first month for which he was entitled to old-age insurance benefits,

            a child of such individual adopted after such individual became entitled to such old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be deemed not to meet the requirements of clause (i) or (iii) of paragraph (1)(C) unless such child—

            (C) is the natural child or stepchild of such individual (including such a child who was legally adopted by such individual), or

            (D)

                (i) was legally adopted by such individual in an adoption decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States, and

                (ii) in the case of a child who attained the age of 18 prior to the commencement of proceedings for adoption, the child was living with or receiving at least one-half of the child’s support from such individual for the year immediately preceding the month in which the adoption is decreed.

        (9)

            (A) A child who is a child of an individual under clause (3) of the first sentence of [section 416(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s416/e] and is not a child of such individual under clause (1) or (2) of such first sentence shall be deemed not to be dependent on such individual at the time specified in subparagraph (1)(C) of this subsection unless (i) such child was living with such individual in the United States and receiving at least one-half of his support from such individual (I) for the year immediately before the month in which such individual became entitled to old-age insurance benefits or disability insurance benefits or died, or (II) if such individual had a period of disability which continued until he had become entitled to old-age insurance benefits, or disability insurance benefits, or died, for the year immediately before the month in which such period of disability began, and (ii) the period during which such child was living with such individual began before the child attained age 18.

            (B) In the case of a child who was born in the one-year period during which such child must have been living with and receiving at least one-half of his support from such individual, such child shall be deemed to meet such requirements for such period if, as of the close of such period, such child has lived with such individual in the United States and received at least one-half of his support from such individual for substantially all of the period which begins on the date of such child’s birth.

        (10)

            (B) For any month for which more than one parent is entitled to parent’s insurance benefits on the basis of such deceased individual’s wages and self-employment income, such benefit for each such parent for such month shall (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) be equal to 75 percent of the primary insurance amount of such deceased individual.

            (C)

             In any case in which—

                (i) any parent is entitled to a parent’s insurance benefit for a month on the basis of a deceased individual’s wages and self-employment income, and

                (ii) another parent of such deceased individual is entitled to a parent’s insurance benefit for such month on the basis of such wages and self-employment income, and on the basis of an application filed after such month and after the month in which the application for the parent’s benefits referred to in clause (i) was filed,

                the amount of the parent’s insurance benefit of the parent referred to in clause (i) for the month referred to in such clause shall be determined under subparagraph (A) instead of subparagraph (B) and the amount of the parent’s insurance benefit of a parent referred to in clause (ii) for such month shall be equal to 150 percent of the primary insurance amount of the deceased individual minus the amount (before the application of [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a]) of the benefit for such month of the parent referred to in clause (i).

        (3) As used in this subsection, the term “parent” means the mother or father of an individual, a stepparent of an individual by a marriage contracted before such individual attained the age of sixteen, or an adopting parent by whom an individual was adopted before he attained the age of sixteen.

        (4)

         In the case of a parent who marries—

            (A) an individual entitled to benefits under this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (e), (f), or (g) of this section, or

            (B) an individual who has attained the age of eighteen and is entitled to benefits under subsection (d) of this section,

            such parent’s entitlement to benefits under this subsection shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection but subject to subsection (s) of this section, not be terminated by reason of such marriage.

    (i) __Lump-sum death payments__ 

    Upon the death, after August 1950, of an individual who died a fully or currently insured individual, an amount equal to three times such individual’s primary insurance amount (as determined without regard to the amendments made by section 2201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, relating to the repeal of the minimum benefit provisions), or an amount equal to $255, whichever is the smaller, shall be paid in a lump sum to the person, if any, determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the widow or widower of the deceased and to have been living in the same household with the deceased at the time of death. If there is no such person, or if such person dies before receiving payment, then such amount shall be paid—

        (1) to a widow (as defined in [section 416(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s416/c]) or widower (as defined in [section 416(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s416/g]) who is entitled (or would have been so entitled had a timely application been filed), on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual, to benefits under subsection (e), (f), or (g) of this section for the month in which occurred such individual’s death; or

        (2) if no person qualifies for payment under paragraph (1), or if such person dies before receiving payment, in equal shares to each person who is entitled (or would have been so entitled had a timely application been filed), on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual, to benefits under subsection (d) of this section for the month in which occurred such individual’s death.

        No payment shall be made to any person under this subsection unless application therefor shall have been filed, by or on behalf of such person (whether or not legally competent), prior to the expiration of two years after the date of death of such insured individual, or unless such person was entitled to wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits, on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual, for the month preceding the month in which such individual died. In the case of any individual who died outside the forty-eight States and the District of Columbia after December 1953 and before January 1, 1957, whose death occurred while he was in the active military or naval service of the United States, and who is returned to any of such States, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa for interment or reinterment, the provisions of the preceding sentence shall not prevent payment to any person under the second sentence of this subsection if application for a lump-sum death payment with respect to such deceased individual is filed by or on behalf of such person (whether or not legally competent) prior to the expiration of two years after the date of such interment or reinterment. In the case of any individual who died outside the fifty States and the District of Columbia after December 1956 while he was performing service, as a member of a uniformed service, to which the provisions of section 410(l)(1) of this title are applicable, and who is returned to any State, or to any Territory or possession of the United States, for interment or reinterment, the provisions of the third sentence of this subsection shall not prevent payment to any person under the second sentence of this subsection if application for a lump-sum death payment with respect to such deceased individual is filed by or on behalf of such person (whether or not legally competent) prior to the expiration of two years after the date of such interment or reinterment.

    (j) __Application for monthly insurance benefits__ 

        (1)

         Subject to the limitations contained in paragraph (4), an individual who would have been entitled to a benefit under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section for any month after August 1950 had he filed application therefor prior to the end of such month shall be entitled to such benefit for such month if he files application therefor prior to—

            (A) the end of the twelfth month immediately succeeding such month in any case where the individual (i) is filing application for a benefit under subsection (e) or (f) of this section, and satisfies paragraph (1)(B) of such subsection by reason of clause (ii) thereof, or (ii) is filing application for a benefit under subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of a person entitled to disability insurance benefits, or

            (B) the end of the sixth month immediately succeeding such month in any case where subparagraph (A) does not apply.

            Any benefit under this subchapter for a month prior to the month in which application is filed shall be reduced, to any extent that may be necessary, so that it will not render erroneous any benefit which, before the filing of such application, the Commissioner of Social Security has certified for payment for such prior month.

        (2) An application for any monthly benefits under this section filed before the first month in which the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits shall be deemed a valid application (and shall be deemed to have been filed in such first month) only if the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits before the Commissioner of Social Security makes a final decision on the application and no request under [section 405(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s405/b] for notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon is made or, if such a request is made, before a decision based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing is made (regardless of whether such decision becomes the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security).

        (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), an individual may, at his option, waive entitlement to any benefit referred to in paragraph (1) for any one or more consecutive months (beginning with the earliest month for which such individual would otherwise be entitled to such benefit) which occur before the month in which such individual files application for such benefit; and, in such case, such individual shall not be considered as entitled to such benefits for any such month or months before such individual filed such application. An individual shall be deemed to have waived such entitlement for any such month for which such benefit would, under the second sentence of paragraph (1), be reduced to zero.

        (4)

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no individual shall be entitled to a monthly benefit under subsection (a), (b), (c), (e), or (f) of this section for any month prior to the month in which he or she files an application for benefits under that subsection if the amount of the monthly benefit to which such individual would otherwise be entitled for any such month would be subject to reduction pursuant to subsection (q) of this section.

            (B)

                (i) If the individual applying for retroactive benefits is a widow, surviving divorced wife, or widower and is under a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]), and such individual would, except for subparagraph (A), be entitled to retroactive benefits as a disabled widow or widower or disabled surviving divorced wife for any month before attaining the age of 60, then subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to such month or any subsequent month.

                (ii) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a benefit under subsection (e) or (f) of this section for the month immediately preceding the month of application, if the insured individual died in that preceding month.

                (iii) As used in this subparagraph, the term “retroactive benefits” means benefits to which an individual becomes entitled for a month prior to the month in which application for such benefits is filed.

        (5)

         In any case in which it is determined to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that an individual failed as of any date to apply for monthly insurance benefits under this subchapter by reason of misinformation provided to such individual by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration relating to such individual’s eligibility for benefits under this subchapter, such individual shall be deemed to have applied for such benefits on the later of—

            (A) the date on which such misinformation was provided to such individual, or

            (B) the date on which such individual met all requirements for entitlement to such benefits (other than application therefor).

    (k) __Simultaneous entitlement to benefits__ 

        (1) A child, entitled to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an insured individual, who would be entitled, on filing application, to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of some other insured individual, shall be deemed entitled, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such other individual if an application for child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such other individual has been filed by any other child who would, on filing application, be entitled to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of both such insured individuals.

        (2)

            (A) Any child who under the preceding provisions of this section is entitled for any month to child’s insurance benefits on the wages and self-employment income of more than one insured individual shall, notwithstanding such provisions, be entitled to only one of such child’s insurance benefits for such month. Such child’s insurance benefits for such month shall be the benefit based on the wages and self-employment income of the insured individual who has the greatest primary insurance amount, except that such child’s insurance benefits for such month shall be the largest benefit to which such child could be entitled under subsection (d) of this section (without the application of [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a]) or subsection (m) of this section if entitlement to such benefit would not, with respect to any person, result in a benefit lower (after the application of [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a]) than the benefit which would be applicable if such child were entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the individual with the greatest primary insurance amount. Where more than one child is entitled to child’s insurance benefits pursuant to the preceding provisions of this paragraph, each such child who is entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the same insured individuals shall be entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the same such insured individual.

            (B) Any individual (other than an individual to whom subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies) who, under the preceding provisions of this section and under the provisions of [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423], is entitled for any month to more than one monthly insurance benefit (other than an old-age or disability insurance benefit) under this subchapter shall be entitled to only one such monthly benefit for such month, such benefit to be the largest of the monthly benefits to which he (but for this subparagraph) would otherwise be entitled for such month. Any individual who is entitled for any month to more than one widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit to which subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies shall be entitled to only one such benefit for such month, such benefit to be the largest of such benefits.

        (3)

            (A) If an individual is entitled to an old-age or disability insurance benefit for any month and to any other monthly insurance benefit for such month, such other insurance benefit for such month, after any reduction under subsection (q), subsection (e)(2) or (f)(2) of this section, and any reduction under [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a], shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such old-age or disability insurance benefit (after reduction under such subsection (q) of this section).

            (B) If an individual is entitled for any month to a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit to which subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies and to any other monthly insurance benefit under this section (other than an old-age insurance benefit), such other insurance benefit for such month, after any reduction under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, any reduction under subsection (q) of this section, and any reduction under [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a], shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit after any reduction or reductions under such subparagraph (A) and such section 403(a).

        (4) Any individual who, under this section and [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423], is entitled for any month to both an old-age insurance benefit and a disability insurance benefit under this subchapter shall be entitled to only the larger of such benefits for such month, except that, if such individual so elects, he shall instead be entitled to only the smaller of such benefits for such month.

        (5)

            (A)

             The amount of a monthly insurance benefit of any individual for each month under subsection (b), (c), (e), (f), or (g) of this section (as determined after application of the provisions of subsection (q) of this section and the preceding provisions of this subsection) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to two-thirds of the amount of any monthly periodic benefit payable to such individual for such month which is based upon such individual’s earnings while in the service of the Federal Government or any State (or political subdivision thereof, as defined in [section 418(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s418/b/2]) if, during any portion of the last 60 months of such service ending with the last day such individual was employed by such entity—

                (i) such service did not constitute “employment” as defined in [section 410 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410], or

                (ii)

                 such service was being performed while in the service of the Federal Government, and constituted “employment” as so defined solely by reason of—

                    (I) clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (G) of [section 410(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/a/5], where the lump-sum payment described in such clause (ii) or the cessation of coverage described in such clause (iii) (whichever is applicable) was received or occurred on or after January 1, 1988, or

                    (II) an election to become subject to the Federal Employees’ Retirement System provided in chapter 84 of title 5 or the Foreign Service Pension System provided in subchapter II of chapter 8 of title I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 \[[22 U.S.C. 4071][/us/usc/t22/s4071] et seq.\] made pursuant to law after December 31, 1987,

                    unless subparagraph (B) applies.

                The amount of the reduction in any benefit under this subparagraph, if not a multiple of $0.10, shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $0.10.

            (B)

                (i) Subparagraph (A)(i) shall not apply with respect to monthly periodic benefits based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in [section 410(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/m]).

                (ii) Subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not apply with respect to monthly periodic benefits based in whole or in part on service which constituted “employment” as defined in [section 410 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410] if such service was performed for at least 60 months in the aggregate during the period beginning January 1, 1988, and ending with the close of the first calendar month as of the end of which such individual is eligible for benefits under this subsection and has made a valid application for such benefits.

            (C) For purposes of this paragraph, any periodic benefit which otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), but which is paid on other than a monthly basis, shall be allocated on a basis equivalent to a monthly benefit (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) and such equivalent monthly benefit shall constitute a monthly periodic benefit for purposes of subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “periodic benefit” includes a benefit payable in a lump sum if it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments.

    (l) __Entitlement to survivor benefits under railroad retirement provisions__ 

        If any person would be entitled, upon filing application therefor to an annuity under section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 \[[45 U.S.C. 231a][/us/usc/t45/s231a]\], or to a lump-sum payment under section 6(b) of such Act \[[45 U.S.C. 231e(b)][/us/usc/t45/s231e/b]\], with respect to the death of an employee (as defined in such Act) no lump-sum death payment, and no monthly benefit for the month in which such employee died or for any month thereafter, shall be paid under this section to any person on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such employee.

    (m) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 97–35, title XXII, § 2201(b)(10)__  __][/us/pl/97/35/s2201/b/10]__  __,__  __Aug. 13, 1981__  __,__  __[__  __95 Stat. 831__  __][/us/stat/95/831]__ 

    (n) __Termination of benefits upon removal of primary beneficiary__ 

        (1)

         If any individual is (after September 1, 1954) removed under [section 1227(a) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1227/a] (other than under paragraph (1)(C) of such section) or under [section 1182(a)(6)(A) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/6/A], then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter—

            (A) no monthly benefit under this section or [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423] shall be paid to such individual, on the basis of his wages and self-employment income, for any month occurring (i) after the month in which the Commissioner of Social Security is notified by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security that such individual has been so removed, and (ii) before the month in which such individual is thereafter lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence,

            (B) if no benefit could be paid to such individual (or if no benefit could be paid to him if he were alive) for any month by reason of subparagraph (A), no monthly benefit under this section shall be paid, on the basis of his wages and self-employment income, for such month to any other person who is not a citizen of the United States and is outside the United States for any part of such month, and

            (C) no lump-sum death payment shall be made on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income if he dies (i) in or after the month in which such notice is received, and (ii) before the month in which he is thereafter lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.

            Section 403(b), (c), and (d) of this title shall not apply with respect to any such individual for any month for which no monthly benefit may be paid to him by reason of this paragraph.

        (2) As soon as practicable after the removal of any individual under any of the paragraphs of [section 1227(a) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1227/a] (other than under paragraph (1)(C) of such section) or under [section 1182(a)(6)(A) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1182/a/6/A], the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify the Commissioner of Social Security of such removal.

        (3) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, an individual against whom a final order of removal has been issued under paragraph (4)(D) of [section 1227(a) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1227/a] (relating to participating in Nazi persecutions or genocide) shall be considered to have been removed under such paragraph (4)(D) as of the date on which such order became final.

    (o) __Application for benefits by survivors of members and former members of uniformed services__ 

        In the case of any individual who would be entitled to benefits under subsection (d), (e), (g), or (h) of this section upon filing proper application therefor, the filing with the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs by or on behalf of such individual of an application for such benefits, on the form described in [section 5105 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5105], shall satisfy the requirement of such subsection (d), (e), (g), or (h) that an application for such benefits be filed.

        any such proof or application, as the case may be, which is filed after the expiration of such period shall be deemed to have been filed within such period if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that there was good cause for failure to file such proof or application within such period. The determination of what constitutes good cause for purposes of this subsection shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security.

        (1)

         Subject to paragraph (9), if the first month for which an individual is entitled to an old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age, the amount of such benefit for such month and for any subsequent month shall, subject to the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, be reduced by—

            (A) 5⁄9 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is an old-age insurance benefit, 25⁄36 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, or 19⁄40 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit, multiplied by

            (B)

                (i) the number of months in the reduction period for such benefit (determined under paragraph (6)), if such benefit is for a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age, or

                (ii) if less, the number of such months in the adjusted reduction period for such benefit (determined under paragraph (7)), if such benefit is (I) for the month in which such individual attains age 62, or (II) for the month in which such individual attains retirement age.

        (2) If an individual is entitled to a disability insurance benefit for a month after a month for which such individual was entitled to an old-age insurance benefit, such disability insurance benefit for each month shall be reduced by the amount such old-age insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraphs (1) and (4) for such month had such individual attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title) in the first month for which he most recently became entitled to a disability insurance benefit.

        (3)

            (A)

             If the first month for which an individual both is entitled to a wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit and has attained age 62 (in the case of a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit) or age 50 (in the case of a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit) is a month for which such individual is also entitled to—

                (i) an old-age insurance benefit (to which such individual was first entitled for a month before he attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title)), or

                (ii) a disability insurance benefit,

                then in lieu of any reduction under paragraph (1) (but subject to the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection) such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit for each month shall be reduced as provided in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D).

            (B)

             For any month for which such individual is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit and is not entitled to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the sum of—

                (i) the amount by which such old-age insurance benefit is reduced under paragraph (1) for such month, and

                (ii) the amount by which such wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraph (1) for such month if it were equal to the excess of such wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection) over such old-age insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection).

            (C)

             For any month for which such individual is entitled to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the sum of—

                (i) the amount by which such disability insurance benefit is reduced under paragraph (2) for such month (if such paragraph applied to such benefit), and

                (ii) the amount by which such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraph (1) for such month if it were equal to the excess of such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection) over such disability insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection).

            (D) For any month for which such individual is entitled neither to an old-age insurance benefit nor to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the amount by which it would be reduced under paragraph (1).

            (E) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, if the first month for which an individual is entitled to a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit is a month for which such individual is also entitled to an old-age insurance benefit to which such individual was first entitled for that month or for a month before she or he became entitled to a widow’s or widower’s benefit, the reduction in such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit shall be determined under paragraph (1).

        (4)

         If—

            (A) an individual is or was entitled to a benefit subject to reduction under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, and

            (B) such benefit is increased by reason of an increase in the primary insurance amount of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based,

            then the amount of the reduction of such benefit (after the application of any adjustment under paragraph (7)) for each month beginning with the month of such increase in the primary insurance amount shall be computed under paragraph (1) or (3), whichever applies, as though the increased primary insurance amount had been in effect for and after the month for which the individual first became entitled to such monthly benefit reduced under such paragraph (1) or (3).

        (5)

            (A)

             No wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit shall be reduced under this subsection—

                (i) for any month before the first month for which there is in effect a certificate filed by him or her with the Commissioner of Social Security, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, in which he or she elects to receive wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits reduced as provided in this subsection, or

                (ii) for any month in which he or she has in his or her care (individually or jointly with the person on whose wages and self-employment income the wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit is based) a child of such person entitled to child’s insurance benefits.

            (B)

             Any certificate described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be effective for purposes of this subsection (and for purposes of preventing deductions under [section 403(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/c/2])—

                (i) for the month in which it is filed and for any month thereafter, and

                (ii) for months, in the period designated by the individual filing such certificate, of one or more consecutive months (not exceeding 12) immediately preceding the month in which such certificate is filed;

                except that such certificate shall not be effective for any month before the month in which he or she attains age 62, nor shall it be effective for any month to which subparagraph (A)(ii) applies.

            (C) If an individual does not have in his or her care a child described in subparagraph (A)(ii) in the first month for which he or she is entitled to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, and if such first month is a month before the month in which he or she attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title), he or she shall be deemed to have filed in such first month the certificate described in subparagraph (A)(i).

            (D) No widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit for a month in which he or she has in his or her care a child of his or her deceased spouse (or deceased former spouse) entitled to child’s insurance benefits shall be reduced under this subsection below the amount to which he or she would have been entitled had he or she been entitled for such month to mother’s or father’s insurance benefits on the basis of his or her deceased spouse’s (or deceased former spouse’s) wages and self-employment income.

        (6)

         For purposes of this subsection, the “reduction period” for an individual’s old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is the period—

            (A)

             beginning—

                (i) in the case of an old-age insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which such individual is entitled to such benefit,

                (ii) in the case of a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which a certificate described in paragraph (5)(A)(i) is effective, or

                (iii) in the case of a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which such individual is entitled to such benefit or the first day of the month in which such individual attains age 60, whichever is the later, and

            (B) ending with the last day of the month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age.

        (7)

         For purposes of this subsection, the “adjusted reduction period” for an individual’s old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is the reduction period prescribed in paragraph (6) for such benefit, excluding—

            (A) any month in which such benefit was subject to deductions under section 403(b), 403(c)(1), 403(d)(1), or 422(b) of this title,

            (B) in the case of wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits, any month in which such individual had in his or her care (individually or jointly with the person on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based) a child of such person entitled to child’s insurance benefits,

            (C) in the case of wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits, any month for which such individual was not entitled to such benefits because of the occurrence of an event that terminated her or his entitlement to such benefits,

            (D) in the case of widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits, any month in which the reduction in the amount of such benefit was determined under paragraph (5)(D),

            (E) in the case of widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits, any month before the month in which she or he attained age 62, and also for any later month before the month in which she or he attained retirement age, for which she or he was not entitled to such benefit because of the occurrence of an event that terminated her or his entitlement to such benefits, and

            (F) in the case of old-age insurance benefits, any month for which such individual was entitled to a disability insurance benefit.

        (8) This subsection shall be applied after reduction under [section 403(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/a] and before application of [section 415(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s415/g]. If the amount of any reduction computed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not a multiple of $0.10, it shall be increased to the next higher multiple of $0.10.

        (9)

         The amount of the reduction for early retirement specified in paragraph (1)—

            (A) for old-age insurance benefits, wife’s insurance benefits, and husband’s insurance benefits, shall be the amount specified in such paragraph for the first 36 months of the reduction period (as defined in paragraph (6)) or adjusted reduction period (as defined in paragraph (7)), and five-twelfths of 1 percent for any additional months included in such periods; and

            (B)

             for widow’s insurance benefits and widower’s insurance benefits, shall be periodically revised by the Commissioner of Social Security such that—

                (i) the amount of the reduction at early retirement age as defined in section 416(l) of this title shall be 28.5 percent of the full benefit; and

                (ii) the amount of the reduction for each month in the reduction period (specified in paragraph (6)) or the adjusted reduction period (specified in paragraph (7)) shall be established by linear interpolation between 28.5 percent at the month of attainment of early retirement age and 0 percent at the month of attainment of retirement age.

        (10)

         For purposes of applying paragraph (4), with respect to monthly benefits payable for any month after December 1977 to an individual who was entitled to a monthly benefit as reduced under paragraph (1) or (3) prior to January 1978, the amount of reduction in such benefit for the first month for which such benefit is increased by reason of an increase in the primary insurance amount of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based and for all subsequent months (and similarly for all subsequent increases) shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in such primary insurance amount (such increase being made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (8)). In the case of an individual whose reduced benefit under this section is increased as a result of the use of an adjusted reduction period (in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subsection), then for the first month for which such increase is effective, and for all subsequent months, the amount of such reduction (after the application of the previous sentence, if applicable) shall be determined—

            (A) in the case of old-age, wife’s, and husband’s insurance benefits, by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the adjusted reduction period to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period,

            (B) in the case of widow’s and widower’s insurance benefits for the month in which such individual attains age 62, by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the reduction period beginning with age 62 multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent, plus the number of months in the adjusted reduction period prior to age 62 multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent, and

            (C) in the case of widow’s and widower’s insurance benefits for the month in which such individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title), by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the adjusted reduction period multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period beginning with age 62 multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent, plus the number of months in the adjusted reduction period prior to age 62 multiplied by 19⁄40 of 1 percent,

            such determination being made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (8).

        (11) When an individual is entitled to more than one monthly benefit under this subchapter and one or more of such benefits are reduced under this subsection, paragraph (10) shall apply separately to each such benefit reduced under this subsection before the application of subsection (k) of this section (pertaining to the method by which monthly benefits are offset when an individual is entitled to more than one kind of benefit) and the application of this paragraph shall operate in conjunction with paragraph (3).

    (r) __Presumed filing of application by individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits and for wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits__ 

        (1) If the first month for which an individual is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit is a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title), and if such individual is eligible for a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit for such first month, such individual shall be deemed to have filed an application in such month for wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits.

        (2)

         If the first month for which an individual is entitled to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit reduced under subsection (q) of this section is a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title), and if such individual is eligible (but for subsection (k)(4) of this section) for an old-age insurance benefit for such first month, such individual shall be deemed to have filed an application for old-age insurance benefits—

            (A) in such month, or

            (B) if such individual is also entitled to a disability insurance benefit for such month, in the first subsequent month for which such individual is not entitled to a disability insurance benefit.

        (3) For purposes of this subsection, an individual shall be deemed eligible for a benefit for a month if, upon filing application therefor in such month, he would be entitled to such benefit for such month.

    (s) __Child over specified age to be disregarded for certain benefit purposes unless disabled__ 

        (1) For the purposes of subsections (b)(1), (c)(1), (g)(1), (q)(5), and (q)(7) of this section and paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of [section 403(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403/c], a child who is entitled to child’s insurance benefits under subsection (d) of this section for any month, and who has attained the age of 16 but is not in such month under a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]), shall be deemed not entitled to such benefits for such month, unless he was under such a disability in the third month before such month.

        (2) So much of subsections (b)(3), (c)(4),1 (d)(5), (g)(3), and (h)(4) of this section as precedes the semicolon, shall not apply in the case of any child unless such child, at the time of the marriage referred to therein, was under a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]) or had been under such a disability in the third month before the month in which such marriage occurred.

        (3) The last sentence of subsection (c) of [section 403 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403], subsection (f)(1)(C) of [section 403 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403], and subsections (b)(3)(B), (c)(6)(B),1 (f)(3)(B), and (g)(6)(B) 1 of [section 416 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s416] shall not apply in the case of any child with respect to any month referred to therein unless in such month or the third month prior thereto such child was under a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]).

    (t) __Suspension of benefits of aliens who are outside United States; residency requirements for dependents and survivors__ 

        (1)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no monthly benefits shall be paid under this section or under [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423] to any individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States for any month which is—

            (A) after the sixth consecutive calendar month during all of which the Commissioner of Social Security finds, on the basis of information furnished to the Commissioner by the Attorney General or information which otherwise comes to the Commissioner’s attention, that such individual is outside the United States, and

            (B) prior to the first month thereafter for all of which such individual has been in the United States.

            For purposes of the preceding sentence, after an individual has been outside the United States for any period of thirty consecutive days he shall be treated as remaining outside the United States until he has been in the United States for a period of thirty consecutive days.

        (2)

         Subject to paragraph (11), paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a foreign country which the Commissioner of Social Security finds has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general application in such country and under which—

        (4)

         Subject to paragraph (11), paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to any benefit for any month if—

            (A) not less than forty of the quarters elapsing before such month are quarters of coverage for the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based, or

            (B) the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based has, before such month, resided in the United States for a period or periods aggregating ten years or more, or

            (C) the individual entitled to such benefit is outside the United States while in the active military or naval service of the United States, or

            (D) the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based died, before such month, either (i) while on active duty or inactive duty training (as those terms are defined in section 410(l) (2) and (3) of this title) as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in [section 410(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/m]), or (ii) as the result of a disease or injury which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines was incurred or aggravated in line of duty while on active duty (as defined in section 410(l)(2) of this title), or an injury which he determines was incurred or aggravated in line of duty while on inactive duty training (as defined in section 410(l)(3) of this title), as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in [section 410(m) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/m]), if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that such individual was discharged or released from the period of such active duty or inactive duty training under conditions other than dishonorable, and if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs certifies to the Commissioner of Social Security his determinations with respect to such individual under this clause, or

            (E) the individual on whose employment such benefit is based had been in service covered by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 or 1974 \[[45 U.S.C. 228a][/us/usc/t45/s228a] et seq., 231 et seq.\] which was treated as employment covered by this chapter pursuant to the provisions of section 5(k)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 \[[45 U.S.C. 228e(k)(1)][/us/usc/t45/s228e/k/1]\] or section 18(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 \[[45 U.S.C. 231q(2)][/us/usc/t45/s231q/2]\];

            except that subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of any individual who is a citizen of a foreign country that has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general application in such country and which satisfies subparagraph (A) but not subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), or who is a citizen of a foreign country that has no social insurance or pension system of general application if at any time within five years prior to the month in which the Social Security Amendments of 1967 are enacted (or the first month thereafter for which his benefits are subject to suspension under paragraph (1)) payments to individuals residing in such country were withheld by the Treasury Department under sections 3329(a) and 3330(a) of title 31.

        (5) No person who is, or upon application would be, entitled to a monthly benefit under this section for December 1956 shall be deprived, by reason of paragraph (1) of this subsection, of such benefit or any other benefit based on the wages and self-employment income of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such monthly benefit for December 1956 is based.

        (7) Subsections (b), (c), and (d) of [section 403 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s403] shall not apply with respect to any individual for any month for which no monthly benefit may be paid to him by reason of paragraph (1) of this subsection.

            (B) [section 783 of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s783],

            (C) any wages paid to such individual or to any other individual in the calendar year in which such conviction occurs or in any prior calendar year, and

            (D) any net earnings from self-employment derived by such individual or by any other individual during a taxable year in which such conviction occurs or during any prior taxable year.

        (2) As soon as practicable after an additional penalty has, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, been imposed with respect to any individual, the Attorney General shall notify the Commissioner of Social Security of such imposition.

        (3) If any individual with respect to whom an additional penalty has been imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection is granted a pardon of the offense by the President of the United States, such additional penalty shall not apply for any month beginning after the date on which such pardon is granted.

    (v) __Waiver of benefits__ 

        (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, and subject to paragraph (3), in the case of any individual who files a waiver pursuant to section 1402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is granted a tax exemption thereunder, no benefits or other payments shall be payable under this subchapter to him, no payments shall be made on his behalf under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter, and no benefits or other payments under this subchapter shall be payable on the basis of his wages and self-employment income to any other person, after the filing of such waiver.

            (A) his wages for and after the calendar year following the calendar year in which occurs the failure to meet the requirements of section 1402(g) or 3127 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on which the cessation of such exemption is based, and

            (B) his self-employment income for and after the taxable year in which occurs such failure.

            (A) the applicable percentage (as determined under paragraph (6)) of such amount, multiplied by

            (B) the number (if any) of the increment months for such individual.

         For purposes of this subsection, the number of increment months for any individual shall be a number equal to the total number of the months—

            (A) which have elapsed after the month before the month in which such individual attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(l) of this title) or (if later) December 1970 and prior to the month in which such individual attained age 70, and

            (B)

             with respect to which—

                (i) such individual was a fully insured individual (as defined in [section 414(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s414/a]),

                (ii) such individual either was not entitled to an old-age insurance benefit or, if so entitled, did not receive benefits pursuant to a request by such individual that benefits not be paid, and

                (iii) such individual was not subject to a penalty imposed under [section 1320a–8a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–8a].

        (6)

         For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the “applicable percentage” is—

            (A) 1⁄12 of 1 percent in the case of an individual who first becomes eligible for an old-age insurance benefit in any calendar year before 1979;

            (B) ¼ of 1 percent in the case of an individual who first becomes eligible for an old-age insurance benefit in any calendar year after 1978 and before 1987;

                    (II) such institution ceases to meet the individual’s basic living needs.

                (iii)

                 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Commissioner shall, for good cause shown, pay the individual benefits that have been withheld or would otherwise be withheld pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) of subparagraph (A) if the Commissioner determines that—

                    (I) a court of competent jurisdiction has found the individual not guilty of the criminal offense, dismissed the charges relating to the criminal offense, vacated the warrant for arrest of the individual for the criminal offense, or issued any similar exonerating order (or taken similar exonerating action), or

                    (II) the individual was erroneously implicated in connection with the criminal offense by reason of identity fraud.

                (iv)

                 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Commissioner may, for good cause shown based on mitigating circumstances, pay the individual benefits that have been withheld or would otherwise be withheld pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) of subparagraph (A) if the Commissioner determines that—

                    (I) the offense described in clause (iv) or underlying the imposition of the probation or parole described in clause (v) was nonviolent and not drug-related, and

                    (II) in the case of an individual from whom benefits have been withheld or otherwise would be withheld pursuant to subparagraph (A)(v), the action that resulted in the violation of a condition of probation or parole was nonviolent and not drug-related.

        (2) Benefits which would be payable to any individual (other than a confined individual to whom benefits are not payable by reason of paragraph (1)) under this subchapter on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such a confined individual but for the provisions of paragraph (1), shall be payable as though such confined individual were receiving such benefits under this section or [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423].

        (3)

            (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 552a of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552a] or any other provision of Federal or State law, any agency of the United States Government or of any State (or political subdivision thereof) shall make available to the Commissioner of Social Security, upon written request, the name and social security account number of any individual who is confined as described in paragraph (1) if the confinement is under the jurisdiction of such agency and the Commissioner of Social Security requires such information to carry out the provisions of this section.

            (B)

                (i)

                 The Commissioner shall enter into an agreement under this subparagraph with any interested State or local institution comprising a jail, prison, penal institution, or correctional facility, or comprising any other institution a purpose of which is to confine individuals as described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii). Under such agreement—

                    (I) the institution shall provide to the Commissioner, on a monthly basis and in a manner specified by the Commissioner, the names, Social Security account numbers, dates of birth, confinement commencement dates, and, to the extent available to the institution, such other identifying information concerning the individuals confined in the institution as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of carrying out paragraph (1) and other provisions of this subchapter; and

                    (II) the Commissioner shall pay to the institution, with respect to information described in subclause (I) concerning each individual who is confined therein as described in paragraph (1)(A), who receives a benefit under this subchapter for the month preceding the first month of such confinement, and whose benefit under this subchapter is determined by the Commissioner to be not payable by reason of confinement based on the information provided by the institution, $400 (subject to reduction under clause (ii)) if the institution furnishes the information to the Commissioner within 30 days after the date such individual’s confinement in such institution begins, or $200 (subject to reduction under clause (ii)) if the institution furnishes the information after 30 days after such date but within 90 days after such date.

                (ii) The dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II) shall be reduced by 50 percent if the Commissioner is also required to make a payment to the institution with respect to the same individual under an agreement entered into under [section 1382(e)(1)(I) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1382/e/1/I].

                (iii) There are authorized to be transferred from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as appropriate, such sums as may be necessary to enable the Commissioner to make payments to institutions required by clause (i)(II).

                (iv) The Commissioner shall maintain, and shall provide on a reimbursable basis, information obtained pursuant to agreements entered into under this paragraph to any agency administering a Federal or federally-assisted cash, food, or medical assistance program for eligibility and other administrative purposes under such program.

            (C)

             Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 552a of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552a] or any other provision of Federal or State law (other than section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and [section 1306(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1306/c]), the Commissioner shall furnish any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer, upon the written request of the officer, with the current address, Social Security number, and photograph (if applicable) of any beneficiary under this subchapter, if the officer furnishes the Commissioner with the name of the beneficiary, and other identifying information as reasonably required by the Commissioner to establish the unique identity of the beneficiary, and notifies the Commissioner that—

                (i) the beneficiary is described in clause (iv) or (v) of paragraph (1)(A); and

                (ii) the location or apprehension of the beneficiary is within the officer’s official duties.

    (y) __Limitation on payments to aliens__
