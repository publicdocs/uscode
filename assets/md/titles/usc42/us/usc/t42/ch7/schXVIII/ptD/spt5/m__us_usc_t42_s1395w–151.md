 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1395w–101(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–101/a/3], referred to in subsec. (a)(4), (8), (9), was in the original “section 1860D–1(a)(4)”, and was translated as meaning section 1860D–1(a)(3) of act Aug. 14, 1935, which is classified to [section 1395w–101(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–101/a/3], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [section 1395w–101(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–101/a] does not contain a par. (4) and par. (3) defines terms for purposes of this part.
