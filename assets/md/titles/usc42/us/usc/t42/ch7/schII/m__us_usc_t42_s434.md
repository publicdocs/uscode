    (b) __Requirements__ 

        The experiments and demonstration projects developed under subsection (a) of this section shall be of sufficient scope and shall be carried out on a wide enough scale to permit a thorough evaluation of the alternative methods under consideration while giving assurance that the results derived from the experiments and projects will obtain generally in the operation of the disability insurance program under this subchapter without committing such program to the adoption of any particular system either locally or nationally.

            (B) no benefit shall be payable under [section 402 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402] on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of the individual for any month for which the benefit of such individual under [section 423(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/a/1] is reduced to $0 pursuant to subparagraph (A);

            (D) in any case in which such an individual is entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII by reason of [section 426(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s426/b] and such individual’s entitlement to a benefit described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or status as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary is terminated pursuant to subparagraph (C), such individual shall be deemed to be entitled to such benefits or to occupy such status (notwithstanding the termination of such entitlement or status) for the period of consecutive months throughout all of which the physical or mental impairment, on which such entitlement or status was based, continues, and throughout all of which such individual would have been entitled to monthly insurance benefits under subchapter II or as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary had such termination of entitlement or status not occurred, but not in excess of 93 such months.

        (3) __Impairment-related work expenses__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Minimum threshold amount__ 

                In this paragraph, the term “minimum threshold amount” means an amount, to be determined by the Commissioner, which shall not exceed the amount sufficient to demonstrate that an individual has rendered services in a month, as determined by the Commissioner under [section 422(c)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s422/c/4/A]. The Commissioner may test multiple minimum threshold amounts.

                (ii) __Definition__ 

                    In this subparagraph, the term “itemized impairment-related work expenses” means the amount excluded under [section 423(d)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d/4/A] from an individual’s earnings for a month in determining whether an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of such earnings in such month, except that such amount does not include the cost to the individual of any item or service for which the individual does not provide to the Commissioner a satisfactory itemized accounting.

            (D) __Limitation__ 

                Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the amount of an individual’s impairment-related work expenses for a month shall not exceed the amount of earnings derived from services, prescribed by the Commissioner under regulations issued pursuant to [section 423(d)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d/4/A], sufficient to demonstrate an individual’s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.
