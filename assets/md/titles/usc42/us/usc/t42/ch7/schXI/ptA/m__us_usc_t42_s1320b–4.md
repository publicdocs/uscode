    For purposes of determining, under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter, the reasonable costs of services provided by nonprofit hospitals or critical access hospitals, the following items shall not be deducted from the operating costs of such hospitals or critical access hospitals:

    (1) A grant, gift, or endowment, or income therefrom, which is to or for such a hospital and which has not been designated by the donor for paying any specific operating costs.

    (2) A grant or similar payment which is to such a hospital, which was made by a governmental entity, and which is not available under the terms of the grant or payment for use as operating funds.

    (3) Those types of donor designated grants and gifts (including grants and similar payments which are made by a governmental entity), and income therefrom, which the Secretary determines, in the best interests of needed health care, should be encouraged.

    (4) The proceeds from the sale or mortgage of any real estate or other capital asset of such a hospital, which real estate or asset the hospital acquired through gift or grant, if such proceeds are not available for use as operating funds under the terms of the gift or grant.

    Paragraph (4) shall not apply to the recovery of the appropriate share of depreciation when gains or losses are realized from the disposal of depreciable assets.
