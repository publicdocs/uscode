## § 1395a. Free choice by patient guaranteed

    (a) __Basic freedom of choice__ 

        Any individual entitled to insurance benefits under this subchapter may obtain health services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to participate under this subchapter if such institution, agency, or person undertakes to provide him such services.

    (b) __Use of private contracts by medicare beneficiaries__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to the provisions of this subsection, nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit a physician or practitioner from entering into a private contract with a medicare beneficiary for any item or service—

            (A) for which no claim for payment is to be submitted under this subchapter, and

            (B)

             for which the physician or practitioner receives—

                (i) no reimbursement under this subchapter directly or on a capitated basis, and

                (ii) receives no amount for such item or service from an organization which receives reimbursement for such item or service under this subchapter directly or on a capitated basis.

        (2) __Beneficiary protections__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any contract unless—

                (i) the contract is in writing and is signed by the medicare beneficiary before any item or service is provided pursuant to the contract;

                (ii) the contract contains the items described in subparagraph (B); and

                (iii) the contract is not entered into at a time when the medicare beneficiary is facing an emergency or urgent health care situation.

            (B) __Items required to be included in contract__ 

            Any contract to provide items and services to which paragraph (1) applies shall clearly indicate to the medicare beneficiary that by signing such contract the beneficiary—

                (i) agrees not to submit a claim (or to request that the physician or practitioner submit a claim) under this subchapter for such items or services even if such items or services are otherwise covered by this subchapter;

                (ii) agrees to be responsible, whether through insurance or otherwise, for payment of such items or services and understands that no reimbursement will be provided under this subchapter for such items or services;

                (iii) acknowledges that no limits under this subchapter (including the limits under [section 1395w–4(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–4/g]) apply to amounts that may be charged for such items or services;

                (iv) acknowledges that Medigap plans under [section 1395ss of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ss] do not, and other supplemental insurance plans may elect not to, make payments for such items and services because payment is not made under this subchapter; and

                (v) acknowledges that the medicare beneficiary has the right to have such items or services provided by other physicians or practitioners for whom payment would be made under this subchapter.

                Such contract shall also clearly indicate whether the physician or practitioner is excluded from participation under the medicare program under [section 1320a–7 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7].

        (3) __Physician or practitioner requirements__

                (iii) a copy of the affidavit is filed with the Secretary no later than 10 days after the first contract to which such affidavit applies is entered into.

            (C) __Enforcement__ 

            If a physician or practitioner signing an affidavit under subparagraph (B) knowingly and willfully submits a claim under this subchapter for any item or service provided during the applicable 2-year period (or receives any reimbursement or amount described in paragraph (1)(B) for any such item or service) with respect to such affidavit—

                (i) this subsection shall not apply with respect to any items and services provided by the physician or practitioner pursuant to any contract on and after the date of such submission and before the end of such period; and

                (ii) no payment shall be made under this subchapter for any item or service furnished by the physician or practitioner during the period described in clause (i) (and no reimbursement or payment of any amount described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be made for any such item or service).

            (D) __Applicable 2-year periods for effectiveness of affidavits__ 

                In this subsection, the term “applicable 2-year period” means, with respect to an affidavit of a physician or practitioner under subparagraph (B), the 2-year period beginning on the date the affidavit is signed and includes each subsequent 2-year period unless the physician or practitioner involved provides notice to the Secretary (in a form and manner specified by the Secretary), not later than 30 days before the end of the previous 2-year period, that the physician or practitioner does not want to extend the application of the affidavit for such subsequent 2-year period.
