## § 1320a–10. Effect of failure to carry out State plan

    In an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter, such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the availability of private actions to enforce State plan requirements other than by overturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in prior Supreme Court decisions respecting such enforceability: Provided, however, That this section is not intended to alter the holding in Suter v. Artist M. that [section 671(a)(15) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s671/a/15] is not enforceable in a private right of action.

([Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531][/us/act/1935-08-14/ch531], title XI, § 1130A, as added [Pub. L. 103–432, title II][/us/pl/103/432/tII], § 211(a), Oct. 31, 1994, [108 Stat. 4460][/us/stat/108/4460].)

 __Effective Date__ 

[Pub. L. 103–432, title II][/us/pl/103/432/tII], § 211(b), Oct. 31, 1994, [108 Stat. 4460][/us/stat/108/4460], provided that: 

> “The amendment made by subsection (a) \[enacting this section\] shall apply to actions pending on the date of the enactment of this Act \[Oct. 31, 1994\] and to actions brought on or after such date of enactment.”
