            (B) __Quality assessment and assurance__ 

                A nursing facility must maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, and at least 3 other members of the facility’s staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies. A State or the Secretary may not require disclosure of the records of such committee except insofar as such disclosure is related to the compliance of such committee with the requirements of this subparagraph.

        (2) __Scope of services and activities under plan of care__ 

        A nursing facility must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care which—

        (3) __Residents’ assessment__ 

            (A) __Requirement__

                A State mental health authority and a State mental retardation or developmental disability authority may not delegate (by subcontract or otherwise) their responsibilities under this subparagraph to a nursing facility (or to an entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with such a facility).

        (4) __Provision of services and activities__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            To the extent needed to fulfill all plans of care described in paragraph (2), a nursing facility must provide (or arrange for the provision of)—

                (ii) medically-related social services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident;

                (iii) pharmaceutical services (including procedures that assure the accurate acquiring, receiving, dispensing, and administering of all drugs and biologicals) to meet the needs of each resident;

                (ii) __Waiver by State__ 

                To the extent that a facility is unable to meet the requirements of clause (i), a State may waive such requirements with respect to the facility if—

                    (II) the State determines that a waiver of the requirement will not endanger the health or safety of individuals staying in the facility,

                    (III) the State finds that, for any such periods in which licensed nursing services are not available, a registered professional nurse or a physician is obligated to respond immediately to telephone calls from the facility,

                    (IV) the State agency granting a waiver of such requirements provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term care ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of the Older Americans Act of 1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and

                    (V) the nursing facility that is granted such a waiver by a State notifies residents of the facility (or, where appropriate, the guardians or legal representatives of such residents) and members of their immediate families of the waiver.

                 A waiver under this clause shall be subject to annual review and to the review of the Secretary and subject to clause (iii) shall be accepted by the Secretary for purposes of this subchapter to the same extent as is the State’s certification of the facility.

            (D) __Re-training required__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), if, since an individual’s most recent completion of a training and competency evaluation program, there has been a continuous period of 24 consecutive months during none of which the individual performed nursing or nursing-related services for monetary compensation, such individual shall complete a new training and competency evaluation program, or a new competency evaluation program.

                (i) the transfer or discharge is necessary to meet the resident’s welfare and the resident’s welfare cannot be met in the facility;

                    (II) prohibit the imposition on a nurse aide who is employed by (or who has received an offer of employment from) a facility on the date on which the aide begins either such program of any charges (including any charges for textbooks and other required course materials and any charges for the competency evaluation) for either such program, and

                    (III) in the case of a nurse aide not described in subclause (II) who is employed by (or who has received an offer of employment from) a facility not later than 12 months after completing either such program, the State shall provide for the reimbursement of costs incurred in completing such program on a prorata basis during the period in which the nurse aide is so employed.

            (B) __Approval of certain programs__ 

            Such requirements—

                (i) may permit approval of programs offered by or in facilities, as well as outside facilities (including employee organizations), and of programs in effect on December 22, 1987;

                (ii) shall permit a State to find that an individual who has completed (before July 1, 1989) a nurse aide training and competency evaluation program shall be deemed to have completed such a program approved under subsection (b)(5) of this section if the State determines that, at the time the program was offered, the program met the requirements for approval under such paragraph; and

                (iii)

                 subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), shall prohibit approval of such a program—

                    (I)

                     offered by or in a nursing facility which, within the previous 2 years—    (a) has operated under a waiver under subsection (b)(4)(C)(ii) of this section that was granted on the basis of a demonstration that the facility is unable to provide the nursing care required under subsection (b)(4)(C)(i) of this section for a period in excess of 48 hours during a week;

                    (II) offered by or in a nursing facility unless the State makes the determination, upon an individual’s completion of the program, that the individual is competent to provide nursing and nursing-related services in nursing facilities.

                 A State may not delegate (through subcontract or otherwise) its responsibility under clause (iii)(II) to the nursing facility.

            (C) __Waiver authorized__ 

            Clause (iii)(I) of subparagraph (B) shall not apply to a program offered in (but not by) a nursing facility (or skilled nursing facility for purposes of subchapter XVIII of this chapter) in a State if the State—

                (i) determines that there is no other such program offered within a reasonable distance of the facility,

                (ii) assures, through an oversight effort, that an adequate environment exists for operating the program in the facility, and

                (iii) provides notice of such determination and assurances to the State long-term care ombudsman.

            (D) __Waiver of disapproval of nurse-aide training programs__ 

                Upon application of a nursing facility, the Secretary may waive the application of subparagraph (B)(iii)(I)(c) if the imposition of the civil monetary penalty was not related to the quality of care provided to residents of the facility. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as eliminating any requirement upon a facility to pay a civil monetary penalty described in the preceding sentence.

        (3) __Federal guidelines for State appeals process for transfers and discharges__ 

            For purposes of subsections (c)(2)(B)(iii) and (e)(3) of this section, by not later than October 1, 1988, the Secretary shall establish guidelines for minimum standards which State appeals processes under subsection (e)(3) of this section must meet to provide a fair mechanism for hearing appeals on transfers and discharges of residents from nursing facilities.

        (4) __Secretarial standards qualification of administrators__ 

            For purposes of subsections (d)(1)(C) and (e)(4) of this section, the Secretary shall develop, by not later than March 1, 1988, standards to be applied in assuring the qualifications of administrators of nursing facilities.

        (5) __Criteria for administration__ 

        The Secretary shall establish criteria for assessing a nursing facility’s compliance with the requirement of subsection (d)(1) of this section with respect to—

            (A) its governing body and management,

            (B) agreements with hospitals regarding transfers of residents to and from the hospitals and to and from other nursing facilities,

            (C) disaster preparedness,

            (D) direction of medical care by a physician,

            (F) clinical records, and

            (G) resident and advocate participation.

        (6) __Specification of resident assessment data set and instruments__ 

        The Secretary shall—

            (A) not later than January 1, 1989, specify a minimum data set of core elements and common definitions for use by nursing facilities in conducting the assessments required under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and establish guidelines for utilization of the data set; and

            (B) by not later than April 1, 1990, designate one or more instruments which are consistent with the specification made under subparagraph (A) and which a State may specify under subsection (e)(5)(A) of this section for use by nursing facilities in complying with the requirements of subsection (b)(3)(A)(iii) of this section.

        (7) __List of items and services furnished in nursing facilities not chargeable to the personal funds of a resident__ 

            (A) __Regulations required__ 

                Pursuant to the requirement of section 21(b) of the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977, the Secretary shall issue regulations, on or before the first day of the seventh month to begin after December 22, 1987, that define those costs which may be charged to the personal funds of residents in nursing facilities who are individuals receiving medical assistance with respect to nursing facility services under this subchapter and those costs which are to be included in the payment amount under this subchapter for nursing facility services.

            (B) __Rule if failure to publish regulations__ 

                If the Secretary does not issue the regulations under subparagraph (A) on or before the date required in that subparagraph, in the case of a resident of a nursing facility who is eligible to receive benefits for nursing facility services under this subchapter, for purposes of [section 1396a(a)(28)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/28/B], the Secretary shall be deemed to have promulgated regulations under this paragraph which provide that the costs which may not be charged to the personal funds of such resident (and for which payment is considered to be made under this subchapter) include, at a minimum, the costs for routine personal hygiene items and services furnished by the facility.

        (8) __Federal minimum criteria and monitoring for preadmission screening and resident review__ 

            (A) __Minimum criteria__ 

                The Secretary shall develop, by not later than October 1, 1988, minimum criteria for States to use in making determinations under subsections (b)(3)(F) and (e)(7)(B) of this section and in permitting individuals adversely affected to appeal such determinations, and shall notify the States of such criteria.

            (B) __Monitoring compliance__ 

                The Secretary shall review, in a sufficient number of cases to allow reasonable inferences, each State’s compliance with the requirements of subsection (e)(7)(C)(ii) of this section (relating to discharge and placement for active treatment of certain residents).

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall conduct a special focus facility program for enforcement of requirements for nursing facilities that the Secretary has identified as having substantially failed to meet applicable requirements of this chapter.

            (B) __Periodic surveys__ 

                Under such program the Secretary shall conduct surveys of each facility in the program not less often than once every 6 months.

    (g) __Survey and certification process__ 

        (1) __State and Federal responsibility__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of nursing facilities (other than facilities of the State) with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of State nursing facilities with the requirements of such subsections.

            (B) __Educational program__ 

                Each State shall conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of nursing facilities in order to present current regulations, procedures, and policies under this section.

            (C) __Investigation of allegations of resident neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property__ 

                The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing facilities under this subsection, for a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a resident in a nursing facility or by another individual used by the facility in providing services to such a resident. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that a nurse aide has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the nurse aide and the registry of such finding. If the State finds that any other individual used by the facility has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the appropriate licensure authority. A State shall not make a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the individual.

            (D) __Removal of name from nurse aide registry__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of a finding of neglect under subparagraph (C), the State shall establish a procedure to permit a nurse aide to petition the State to have his or her name removed from the registry upon a determination by the State that—

                    (I) the employment and personal history of the nurse aide does not reflect a pattern of abusive behavior or neglect; and

                    (II) the neglect involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence.

                (ii) __Timing of determination__ 

                    In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under clause (i) be made prior to the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the name of the petitioner was added to the registry under subparagraph (C).

            (E) __Construction__ 

                The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.

        (2) __Surveys__ 

            (A) __Annual standard survey__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a]. The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.

                (ii) __Contents__ 

                Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents—

                    (I) a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,

                    (II) written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section and an audit of the residents’ assessments under subsection (b)(3) of this section to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and

                    (III) a review of compliance with residents’ rights under subsection (c) of this section.

                (iii) __Frequency__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this subparagraph. The statewide average interval between standard surveys of a nursing facility shall not exceed 12 months.

                    (II) __Special surveys__ 

                        If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a nursing facility, or director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.

            (B) __Extended surveys__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary’s or State’s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).

                (ii) __Timing__ 

                    The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).

                (iii) __Contents__ 

                    In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents’ assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.

                (iv) __Construction__ 

                    Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) of this section on the basis of findings in a standard survey.

            (C) __Survey protocol__ 

            Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted—

                (i) based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than January 1, 1990, and

                (ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.

                The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary’s responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.

            (D) __Consistency of surveys__ 

                Each State shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.

            (E) __Survey teams__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Surveys under this subsection shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (including a registered professional nurse).

                (ii) __Prohibition of conflicts of interest__ 

                    A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.

                (iii) __Training__ 

                    The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.

        (3) __Validation surveys__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the facility’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.

            (B) __Scope__ 

                With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities in the State.

            (C) __Reduction in administrative costs for substandard performance__ 

                If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State’s survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under [section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/2/D] with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary’s findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under [section 1316 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1316] in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary’s determination under [section 1316(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1316/a/1].

            (D) __Special surveys of compliance__ 

                Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the nursing facility meets such requirements.

        (4) __Investigation of complaints and monitoring nursing facility compliance__ 

        Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to—

            (A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities, and

            (B)

             monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a nursing facility’s compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if—

                (i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;

                (ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or

                (iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.

            A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard nursing facilities.

        (5) __Disclosure of results of inspections and activities__ 

            (A) __Public information__ 

            Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public—

                (i) information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,

                (ii) copies of cost reports of such facilities filed under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII of this chapter,

                (iii) copies of statements of ownership under [section 1320a–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–3], and

                (iv) information disclosed under [section 1320a–5 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–5].

            (B) __Notice to ombudsman__ 

                Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 \[[42 U.S.C. 3021][/us/usc/t42/s3021] et seq., 3058 et seq.\] in accordance with section 712 of the Act \[[42 U.S.C. 3058g][/us/usc/t42/s3058g]\]) of the State’s findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or of any adverse action taken against a nursing facility under paragraphs  <sup>\[6\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 6 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph”. </sup></sup>  (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (h) of this section, with respect to a nursing facility in the State.

            (C) __Notice to physicians and nursing facility administrator licensing board__ 

            If a State finds that a nursing facility has provided substandard quality of care, the State shall notify—

                (i) the attending physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made, and

                (ii) any State board responsible for the licensing of the nursing facility administrator of the facility.

            (D) __Access to fraud control units__ 

                Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under [section 1396b(q) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/q]) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.

            (E) __Submission of survey and certification information to the Secretary__ 

                In order to improve the timeliness of information made available to the public under subparagraph (A) and provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website under subsection (i), each State shall submit information respecting any survey or certification made respecting a nursing facility (including any enforcement actions taken by the State) to the Secretary not later than the date on which the State sends such information to the facility. The Secretary shall use the information submitted under the preceding sentence to update the information provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website as expeditiously as practicable but not less frequently than quarterly.

    (h) __Enforcement process__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—

            (A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (2); or

            (B)

             do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may—

                (i) terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan,

                (ii) provide for one or more of the remedies described in paragraph (2), or

                (iii) do both.

            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If a State finds that a nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

        (2) __Specified remedies__ 

            (A) __Listing__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedies:

                (i) Denial of payment under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to the nursing facility involved after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State.

                (ii) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty for activities described in subsections (b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (b)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (g)(2)(A)(i) of this section) shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.

                (iii)

                 The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while—

                    (I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or

                    (II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                 The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                (iv) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to close the facility, to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities, or both.

                The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.

            (B) __Deadline and guidance__ 

                (i) Except as provided in clause (ii), as a condition for approval of a State plan for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1989, each State shall establish the remedies described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) by not later than October 1, 1989. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than October 1, 1988, guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.

                (ii) A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Assuring prompt compliance__ 

                If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.

            (D) __Repeated noncompliance__ 

            In the case of a nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the State shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)—

                (i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i), and

                (ii) monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B) of this section,

                until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the State, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.

            (E) __Funding__ 

                The reasonable expenditures of a State to provide for temporary management and other expenses associated with implementing the remedies described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall be considered, for purposes of [section 1396b(a)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/7], to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.

            (F) __Incentives for high quality care__ 

                In addition to the remedies specified in this paragraph, a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter. For purposes of [section 1396b(a)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/7], proper expenses incurred by a State in carrying out such a program shall be considered to be expenses necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan under this subchapter.

        (3) __Secretarial authority__ 

            (A) __For State nursing facilities__ 

                With respect to a State nursing facility, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a State under this subsection, including the authority to impose remedies described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).

            (B) __Other nursing facilities__ 

            With respect to any other nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—

                (i) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (C); or

                (ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (C).

                Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

            (C) __Specified remedies__ 

            The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:

                (i) __Denial of payment__ 

                    The Secretary may deny any further payments to the State for medical assistance furnished by the facility to all individuals in the facility or to individuals admitted to the facility after the effective date of the finding.

                (ii) __Authority with respect to civil money penalties__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Subject to subclause (II), the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a].

                    (II) __Reduction of civil money penalties in certain circumstances__ 

                        Subject to subclause (III), in the case where a facility self-reports and promptly corrects a deficiency for which a penalty was imposed under this clause not later than 10 calendar days after the date of such imposition, the Secretary may reduce the amount of the penalty imposed by not more than 50 percent.

                    (III) __Prohibitions on reduction for certain deficiencies__ 

                        (aa) __Repeat deficiencies__ 

                            The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the Secretary had reduced a penalty imposed on the facility in the preceding year under such subclause with respect to a repeat deficiency.

                        (bb) __Certain other deficiencies__ 

                            The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the penalty is imposed on the facility for a deficiency that is found to result in a pattern of harm or widespread harm, immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of a resident or residents of the facility, or results in the death of a resident of the facility.

                    (IV) __Collection of civil money penalties__ 

                    In the case of a civil money penalty imposed under this clause, the Secretary shall issue regulations that—

                        (aa) subject to item (cc), not later than 30 days after the imposition of the penalty, provide for the facility to have the opportunity to participate in an independent informal dispute resolution process which generates a written record prior to the collection of such penalty;

                        (bb) in the case where the penalty is imposed for each day of noncompliance, provide that a penalty may not be imposed for any day during the period beginning on the initial day of the imposition of the penalty and ending on the day on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed;

                        (cc) may provide for the collection of such civil money penalty and the placement of such amounts collected in an escrow account under the direction of the Secretary on the earlier of the date on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed or the date that is 90 days after the date of the imposition of the penalty;

                        (dd) may provide that such amounts collected are kept in such account pending the resolution of any subsequent appeals;

                        (ee) in the case where the facility successfully appeals the penalty, may provide for the return of such amounts collected (plus interest) to the facility; and

                        (ff) in the case where all such appeals are unsuccessful, may provide that some portion of such amounts collected may be used to support activities that benefit residents, including assistance to support and protect residents of a facility that closes (voluntarily or involuntarily) or is decertified (including offsetting costs of relocating residents to home and community-based settings or another facility), projects that support resident and family councils and other consumer involvement in assuring quality care in facilities, and facility improvement initiatives approved by the Secretary (including joint training of facility staff and surveyors, technical assistance for facilities implementing quality assurance programs, the appointment of temporary management firms, and other activities approved by the Secretary).

                (iii) __Appointment of temporary management__ 

                In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while—

                    (I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or

                    (II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                 The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.

            (D) __Continuation of payments pending remediation__ 

            The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the effective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a nursing facility not in compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, if—

                (i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility, and

                (ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action.

                The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States under this subparagraph.

        (4) __Effective period of denial of payment__ 

            A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the State or Secretary (or both, as the case may be) finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

        (5) __Immediate termination of participation for facility where State or Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy__ 

            If either the State or the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the State or the Secretary, respectively  <sup>\[7\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 7 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup>  shall notify the other of such finding, and the State or the Secretary, respectively, shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) or (3)(C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan. If the facility’s participation in the State plan is terminated by either the State or the Secretary, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under the State plan consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section.

        (6) __Special rules where State and Secretary do not agree on finding of noncompliance__ 

            (A) __State finding of noncompliance and no secretarial finding of noncompliance__ 

                If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but a State finds that the facility has not met such requirements and the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State’s findings shall control and the remedies imposed by the State shall be applied.

            (B) __Secretarial finding of noncompliance and no State finding of noncompliance__ 

            If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, but the State has not made such a finding, the Secretary—

                (i) may impose any remedies specified in paragraph (3)(C) with respect to the facility, and

                (ii) shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D).

        (7) __Special rules for timing of termination of participation where remedies overlap__ 

        If both the Secretary and the State find that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and neither finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents—

            (A)

                (i) if both find that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s timing of any termination shall control so long as the termination date does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate;

                (ii) if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or

                (iii) if the State, but not the Secretary, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s decision to terminate, and timing of such termination, shall control; and

            (B)

                (i) if the Secretary or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, such additional or alternative remedies shall also be applied, or

                (ii) if both the Secretary and the State establish one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, only the additional or alternative remedies of the Secretary shall apply.

        (8) __Construction__

        (9) __Sharing of information__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all information concerning nursing facilities required by this section to be filed with the Secretary or a State agency shall be made available by such facilities to Federal or State employees for purposes consistent with the effective administration of programs established under this subchapter and subchapter XVIII of this chapter, including investigations by State medicaid fraud control units.
