    (b) __Calculation of participation rates__ 

        (1) __All families__ 

            (A) __Average monthly rate__ 

                For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the participation rate for all families of a State for a fiscal year is the average of the participation rates for all families of the State for each month in the fiscal year.

            (B) __Monthly participation rates__ 

            The participation rate of a State for all families of the State for a month, expressed as a percentage, is—

                (i) the number of families receiving assistance under the State program funded under this part or any other State program funded with qualified State expenditures (as defined in [section 609(a)(7)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s609/a/7/B/i]) that include an adult or a minor child head of household who is engaged in work for the month; divided by

                (ii)

                 the amount by which—

                    (I) the number of families receiving such assistance during the month that include an adult or a minor child head of household receiving such assistance; exceeds

                    (II) the number of families receiving such assistance that are subject in such month to a penalty described in subsection (e)(1) of this section but have not been subject to such penalty for more than 3 months within the preceding 12-month period (whether or not consecutive).

        (2) __2-parent families__ 

            (A) __Average monthly rate__ 

                For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, the participation rate for 2-parent families of a State for a fiscal year is the average of the participation rates for 2-parent families of the State for each month in the fiscal year.

            (B) __Monthly participation rates__ 

                The participation rate of a State for 2-parent families of the State for a month shall be calculated by use of the formula set forth in paragraph (1)(B), except that in the formula the term “number of 2-parent families” shall be substituted for the term “number of families” each place such latter term appears.

            (C) __Family with a disabled parent not treated as a 2-parent family__ 

                A family that includes a disabled parent shall not be considered a 2-parent family for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

        (3) __Pro rata reduction of participation rate due to caseload reductions not required by Federal law and not resulting from changes in State eligibility criteria__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for reducing the minimum participation rate otherwise required by this section for a fiscal year by the number of percentage points equal to the number of percentage points (if any) by which—

                (i) the average monthly number of families receiving assistance during the immediately preceding fiscal year under the State program funded under this part or any other State program funded with qualified State expenditures (as defined in [section 609(a)(7)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s609/a/7/B/i]) is less than

                (ii) the average monthly number of families that received assistance under any State program referred to in clause (i) during fiscal year 2005.

                The minimum participation rate shall not be reduced to the extent that the Secretary determines that the reduction in the number of families receiving such assistance is required by Federal law.

            (B) __Eligibility changes not counted__ 

                The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall not take into account families that are diverted from a State program funded under this part as a result of differences in eligibility criteria under a State program funded under this part and the eligibility criteria in effect during fiscal year 2005. Such regulations shall place the burden on the Secretary to prove that such families were diverted as a direct result of differences in such eligibility criteria.

        (4) __State option to include individuals receiving assistance under a tribal family assistance plan or tribal work program__ 

            For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B), a State may, at its option, include families in the State that are receiving assistance under a tribal family assistance plan approved under [section 612 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s612] or under a tribal work program to which funds are provided under this part.

        (5) __State option for participation requirement exemptions__ 

            For any fiscal year, a State may, at its option, not require an individual who is a single custodial parent caring for a child who has not attained 12 months of age to engage in work, and may disregard such an individual in determining the participation rates under subsection (a) of this section for not more than 12 months.

    (c) __Engaged in work__ 

        (1) __General rules__ 

            (A) __All families__ 

                For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section, a recipient is engaged in work for a month in a fiscal year if the recipient is participating in work activities for at least the minimum average number of hours per week specified in the following table during the month, not fewer than 20 hours per week of which are attributable to an activity described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), or (12) of subsection (d) of this section, subject to this subsection:
