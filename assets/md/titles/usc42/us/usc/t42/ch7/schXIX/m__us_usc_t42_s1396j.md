    (c) __Agreement to reimburse State agency for providing care and services__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements with the State agency for the purpose of reimbursing such agency for health care and services provided in Indian Health Service facilities to Indians who are eligible for medical assistance under the State plan.
