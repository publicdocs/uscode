## § 1397ii. Miscellaneous provisions

    (a) __Relation to other laws__ 

        (1) __HIPAA__ 

            Health benefits coverage provided under [section 1397aa(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa/a/1] (and coverage provided under a waiver under [section 1397ee(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397ee/c/2/B]) shall be treated as creditable coverage for purposes of part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \[[29 U.S.C. 1181][/us/usc/t29/s1181] et seq.\], title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act \[[42 U.S.C. 300gg][/us/usc/t42/s300gg] et seq.\], and subtitle K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

        (2) __ERISA__ 

            Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as affecting or modifying section 514 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ([29 U.S.C. 1144][/us/usc/t29/s1144]) with respect to a group health plan (as defined in section 2791(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act ([42 U.S.C. 300gg–91(a)(1)][/us/usc/t42/s300gg–91/a/1])).

    (b) __Adjustment to Current Population Survey to include State-by-State data relating to children without health insurance coverage__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary of Commerce shall make appropriate adjustments to the annual Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census in order to produce statistically reliable annual State data on the number of low-income children who do not have health insurance coverage, so that real changes in the uninsurance rates of children can reasonably be detected. The Current Population Survey should produce data under this subsection that categorizes such children by family income, age, and race or ethnicity. The adjustments made to produce such data shall include, where appropriate, expanding the sample size used in the State sampling units, expanding the number of sampling units in a State, and an appropriate verification element.

        (2) __Additional requirements__ 

        In addition to making the adjustments required to produce the data described in paragraph (1), with respect to data collection occurring for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2009, in appropriate consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Commerce shall do the following:

            (A) Make appropriate adjustments to the Current Population Survey to develop more accurate State-specific estimates of the number of children enrolled in health coverage under subchapter XIX or this subchapter.

            (B) Make appropriate adjustments to the Current Population Survey to improve the survey estimates used to determine a high-performing State under [section 1397kk(b)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397kk/b/3/B] and any other data necessary for carrying out this subchapter.

            (C) Include health insurance survey information in the American Community Survey related to children.

            (D) Assess whether American Community Survey estimates, once such survey data are first available, produce more reliable estimates than the Current Population Survey with respect to the purposes described in subparagraph (B).

            (E) On the basis of the assessment required under subparagraph (D), recommend to the Secretary of Health and Human Services whether American Community Survey estimates should be used in lieu of, or in some combination with, Current Population Survey estimates for the purposes described in subparagraph (B).

            (F) Continue making the adjustments described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) with respect to expansion of the sample size used in State sampling units, the number of sampling units in a State, and using an appropriate verification element.

        (3) __Authority for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to transition to the use of all, or some combination of, ACS estimates upon recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce__ 

            If, on the basis of the assessment required under paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary of Commerce recommends to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that American Community Survey estimates should be used in lieu of, or in some combination with, Current Population Survey estimates for the purposes described in paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the States, may provide for a period during which the Secretary may transition from carrying out such purposes through the use of Current Population Survey estimates to the use of American Community Survey estimates (in lieu of, or in combination with the Current Population Survey estimates, as recommended), provided that any such transition is implemented in a manner that is designed to avoid adverse impacts upon States with approved State child health plans under this subchapter.

        (4) __Appropriation__ 

            Out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and each fiscal year thereafter for the purpose of carrying out this subsection (except that only with respect to fiscal year 2008, there are appropriated $20,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out this subsection, to remain available until expended).
