    (b) __Approval of plans__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall approve a plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this section only if the plan was developed jointly by the Secretary and the State, after consultation by the State agency with appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs of services for children and families (including family preservation, family support, time-limited family reunification, and adoption promotion and support services).

        (2) __Plans of Indian tribes or tribal consortia__ 

            (A) __Exemption from inappropriate requirements__ 

                The Secretary may exempt a plan submitted by an Indian tribe or tribal consortium from the requirements of subsection (a)(4) of this section to the extent that the Secretary determines those requirements would be inappropriate to apply to the Indian tribe or tribal consortium, taking into account the resources, needs, and other circumstances of the Indian tribe or tribal consortium.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary may not approve a plan of an Indian tribe or tribal consortium under this subpart to which (but for this subparagraph) an allotment of less than $10,000 would be made under [section 629c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629c/a] if allotments were made under [section 629c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629c/a] to all Indian tribes and tribal consortia with plans approved under this subpart with the same or larger numbers of children.

    (c) __Annual submission of State reports to Congress__

        (2) __Information to be included__ 

            The compilation shall include the individual State reports and tables that synthesize State information into national totals for each element required to be included in the reports, including planned and actual spending by service category for the program authorized under this subpart and planned spending by service category for the program authorized under subpart 1.

        (3) __Public accessibility__ 

            Not later than September 30 of each year, the Secretary shall publish the compilation on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services in a location easily accessible by the public.
