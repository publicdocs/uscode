## § 1320b–19. The Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Commissioner shall establish a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program, under which a disabled beneficiary may use a ticket to work and self-sufficiency issued by the Commissioner in accordance with this section to obtain employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, or other support services from an employment network which is of the beneficiary’s choice and which is willing to provide such services to such beneficiary.

    (b) __Ticket system__ 

        (1) __Distribution of tickets__ 

            The Commissioner may issue a ticket to work and self-sufficiency to disabled beneficiaries for participation in the Program.

        (2) __Assignment of tickets__ 

            A disabled beneficiary holding a ticket to work and self-sufficiency may assign the ticket to any employment network of the beneficiary’s choice which is serving under the Program and is willing to accept the assignment.

        (3) __Ticket terms__ 

            A ticket issued under paragraph (1) shall consist of a document which evidences the Commissioner’s agreement to pay (as provided in paragraph (4)) an employment network, which is serving under the Program and to which such ticket is assigned by the beneficiary, for such employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, and other support services as the employment network may provide to the beneficiary.

        (4) __Payments to employment networks__ 

            The Commissioner shall pay an employment network under the Program in accordance with the outcome payment system under subsection (h)(2) of this section or under the outcome-milestone payment system under subsection (h)(3) of this section (whichever is elected pursuant to subsection (h)(1) of this section). An employment network may not request or receive compensation for such services from the beneficiary.

    (c) __State participation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ([29 U.S.C. 720][/us/usc/t29/s720] et seq.) may elect to participate in the Program as an employment network with respect to a disabled beneficiary. If the State agency does elect to participate in the Program, the State agency also shall elect to be paid under the outcome payment system or the outcome-milestone payment system in accordance with subsection (h)(1) of this section. With respect to a disabled beneficiary that the State agency does not elect to have participate in the Program, the State agency shall be paid for services provided to that beneficiary under the system for payment applicable under [section 422(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s422/d] and subsections (d) and (e) of [section 1382d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1382d]. The Commissioner shall provide for periodic opportunities for exercising such elections.

        (2) __Effect of participation by State agency__ 

            (A) __State agencies participating__ 

                In any case in which a State agency described in paragraph (1) elects under that paragraph to participate in the Program, the employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, and other support services which, upon assignment of tickets to work and self-sufficiency, are provided to disabled beneficiaries by the State agency acting as an employment network shall be governed by plans for vocational rehabilitation services approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ([29 U.S.C. 720][/us/usc/t29/s720] et seq.).

            (B) __State agencies administering maternal and child health services programs__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any State agency administering a program under subchapter V of this chapter.

        (3) __Agreements between State agencies and employment networks__ 

            State agencies and employment networks shall enter into agreements regarding the conditions under which services will be provided when an individual is referred by an employment network to a State agency for services.

        (2) __Tenure, renewal, and early termination__ 

        Each agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall provide for early termination upon failure to meet performance standards which shall be specified in the agreement and which shall be weighted to take into account any performance in prior terms. Such performance standards shall include—

            (A) measures for ease of access by beneficiaries to services; and

            (B) measures for determining the extent to which failures in obtaining services for beneficiaries fall within acceptable parameters, as determined by the Commissioner.

        Agreements under paragraph (1) shall preclude—

            (A) direct participation by a program manager in the delivery of employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, or other support services to beneficiaries in the service area covered by the program manager’s agreement; and

            (B) the holding by a program manager of a financial interest in an employment network or service provider which provides services in a geographic area covered under the program manager’s agreement.

        (4) __Selection of employment networks__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Commissioner shall select and enter into agreements with employment networks for service under the Program. Such employment networks shall be in addition to State agencies serving as employment networks pursuant to elections under subsection (c) of this section.

            (B) __Alternate participants__ 

                In any State where the Program is being implemented, the Commissioner shall enter into an agreement with any alternate participant that is operating under the authority of [section 422(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s422/d/2] in the State as of December 17, 1999, and chooses to serve as an employment network under the Program.

Employment networks may serve under the Program only pursuant to an agreement entered into with the Commissioner under the Program incorporating the applicable provisions of this section and regulations thereunder, and the program manager shall provide and maintain assurances to the Commissioner that payment by the Commissioner to employment networks pursuant to this section is warranted based on compliance by such employment networks with the terms of such agreement and this section. The program manager shall not impose numerical limits on the number of employment networks to be recommended pursuant to this paragraph.

        (3) __Facilitation of access by beneficiaries to employment networks__ 

            A program manager shall facilitate access by beneficiaries to employment networks. The program manager shall ensure that each beneficiary is allowed changes in employment networks without being deemed to have rejected services under the Program.

Upon the request of the employment network, the program manager shall make a determination of the allocation of the outcome or milestone-outcome payments based on the services provided by each employment network. The program manager shall establish and maintain lists of employment networks available to beneficiaries and shall make such lists generally available to the public. The program manager shall ensure that all information provided to disabled beneficiaries pursuant to this paragraph is provided in accessible formats.

Services provided under the Program may include case management, work incentives planning, supported employment, career planning, career plan development, vocational assessment, job training, placement, follow-up services, and such other services as may be specified by the Commissioner under the Program. The program manager shall ensure that such services are available in each service area.

    (f) __Employment networks__ 

        (1) __Qualifications for employment networks__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Each employment network serving under the Program shall consist of an agency or instrumentality of a State (or a political subdivision thereof) or a private entity, that assumes responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services under the Program to individuals assigning to the employment network tickets to work and self-sufficiency issued under subsection (b) of this section.

            (B) __One-stop delivery systems__ 

                An employment network serving under the Program may consist of a one-stop delivery system established under subtitle B of title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 ([29 U.S.C. 2811][/us/usc/t29/s2811] et seq.).

            (C) __Compliance with selection criteria__ 

                No employment network may serve under the Program unless it meets and maintains compliance with both general selection criteria (such as professional and educational qualifications, where applicable) and specific selection criteria (such as substantial expertise and experience in providing relevant employment services and supports).

            (D) __Single or associated providers allowed__ 

                An employment network shall consist of either a single provider of such services or of an association of such providers organized so as to combine their resources into a single entity. An employment network may meet the requirements of subsection (e)(4) of this section by providing services directly, or by entering into agreements with other individuals or entities providing appropriate employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, or other support services.

        (2) __Requirements relating to provision of services__ 

        Each employment network serving under the Program shall be required under the terms of its agreement with the Commissioner to—

            (A) serve prescribed service areas; and

        (3) __Annual financial reporting__ 

            Each employment network shall meet financial reporting requirements as prescribed by the Commissioner.

        (4) __Periodic outcomes reporting__ 

            Each employment network shall prepare periodic reports, on at least an annual basis, itemizing for the covered period specific outcomes achieved with respect to specific services provided by the employment network. Such reports shall conform to a national model prescribed under this section. Each employment network shall provide a copy of the latest report issued by the employment network pursuant to this paragraph to each beneficiary upon enrollment under the Program for services to be received through such employment network. Upon issuance of each report to each beneficiary, a copy of the report shall be maintained in the files of the employment network. The program manager shall ensure that copies of all such reports issued under this paragraph are made available to the public under reasonable terms.

    (g) __Individual work plans__ 

        (1) __Requirements__ 

        Each employment network shall—

            (A) take such measures as are necessary to ensure that employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, and other support services provided under the Program by, or under agreements entered into with, the employment network are provided under appropriate individual work plans that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C);

            (C)

             ensure that each individual work plan includes at least—

            (E) make each beneficiary’s individual work plan available to the beneficiary in, as appropriate, an accessible format chosen by the beneficiary.

            An individual work plan established pursuant to this subsection shall be treated, for purposes of section 51(d)(6)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as an individualized written plan for employment under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \[[29 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t29/s701] et seq.\].

        (2) __Effective upon written approval__

            (B) __No change in method of payment for beneficiaries with tickets already assigned to the employment networks__ 

                Any election of a payment system by an employment network that would result in a change in the method of payment to the employment network for services provided to a beneficiary who is receiving services from the employment network at the time of the election shall not be effective with respect to payment for services provided to that beneficiary and the method of payment previously selected shall continue to apply with respect to such services.

        (2) __Outcome payment system__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The outcome payment system shall consist of a payment structure governing employment networks electing such system under paragraph (1)(A) which meets the requirements of this paragraph.

            (B) __Payments made during outcome payment period__ 

                The outcome payment system shall provide for a schedule of payments to an employment network, in connection with each individual who is a beneficiary, for each month, during the individual’s outcome payment period, for which benefits (described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (k) of this section) are not payable to such individual because of work or earnings.

            (C) __Computation of payments to employment network__ 

            The payment schedule of the outcome payment system shall be designed so that—

                (i) the payment for each month during the outcome payment period for which benefits (described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (k) of this section) are not payable is equal to a fixed percentage of the payment calculation base for the calendar year in which such month occurs; and

                (ii) such fixed percentage is set at a percentage which does not exceed 40 percent.

        (3) __Outcome-milestone payment system__ 

            (A) __In general__

                The outcome-milestone payment system shall provide for 1 or more milestones, with respect to beneficiaries receiving services from an employment network under the Program, that are directed toward the goal of permanent employment. Such milestones shall form a part of a payment structure that provides, in addition to payments made during outcome payment periods, payments made prior to outcome payment periods in amounts based on the attainment of such milestones.

            (C) __Limitation on total payments to employment network__ 

                The payment schedule of the outcome milestone payment system shall be designed so that the total of the payments to the employment network with respect to each beneficiary is less than, on a net present value basis (using an interest rate determined by the Commissioner that appropriately reflects the cost of funds faced by providers), the total amount to which payments to the employment network with respect to the beneficiary would be limited if the employment network were paid under the outcome payment system.

            (A) __Percentages and periods__ 

                The Commissioner shall periodically review the percentage specified in paragraph (2)(C), the total payments permissible under paragraph (3)(C), and the period of time specified in paragraph (4)(B) to determine whether such percentages, such permissible payments, and such period provide an adequate incentive for employment networks to assist beneficiaries to enter the workforce, while providing for appropriate economies. The Commissioner may alter such percentage, such total permissible payments, or such period of time to the extent that the Commissioner determines, on the basis of the Commissioner’s review under this paragraph, that such an alteration would better provide the incentive and economies described in the preceding sentence.

            (B) __Number and amounts of milestone payments__

L. 106–170][/us/pl/106/170]\] ([42 U.S.C. 1320b–19][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–19] note), and the Commissioner of Social Security regarding such program;

 __Findings and Purposes__ 

[Pub. L. 106–170, § 2][/us/pl/106/170/s2], Dec. 17, 1999, [113 Stat. 1862][/us/stat/113/1862], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Findings__  __.—__ 

>     The Congress makes the following findings:

>         “(1) It is the policy of the United States to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities to lead productive work lives.

>         “(2) Health care is important to all Americans.

>         “(3) Health care is particularly important to individuals with disabilities and special health care needs who often cannot afford the insurance available to them through the private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high and economically devastating health care costs.

>         “(4) Americans with significant disabilities often are unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage of the services and supports that enable them to live independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal assistance services (such as attendant services, personal assistance with transportation to and from work, reader services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of the barriers between significant disability and work. Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to obtain and retain employment.

>         “(5) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing health care and related services is one of the greatest barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their employment, earning potential, and independence.

>         “(6) Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries risk losing medicare or medicaid coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of cash benefits associated with working.

>         “(7) Individuals with disabilities have greater opportunities for employment than ever before, aided by important public policy initiatives such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ([42 U.S.C. 12101][/us/usc/t42/s12101] et seq.), advancements in public understanding of disability, and innovations in assistive technology, medical treatment, and rehabilitation.

>         “(8) Despite such historic opportunities and the desire of millions of disability recipients to work and support themselves, fewer than one-half of one percent of Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries leave the disability rolls and return to work.

>         “(9) In addition to the fear of loss of health care coverage, beneficiaries cite financial disincentives to work and earn income and lack of adequate employment training and placement services as barriers to employment.

>         “(10) Eliminating such barriers to work by creating financial incentives to work and by providing individuals with disabilities real choice in obtaining the services and technology they need to find, enter, and maintain employment can greatly improve their short and long-term financial independence and personal well-being.

>         “(11) In addition to the enormous advantages such changes promise for individuals with disabilities, redesigning government programs to help individuals with disabilities return to work may result in significant savings and extend the life of the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund.

>         “(12) If only an additional one-half of one percent of the current Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income recipients were to cease receiving benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social Security Trust Funds and to the Treasury in cash assistance would total $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of such individuals, far exceeding the cost of providing incentives and services needed to assist them in entering work and achieving financial independence to the best of their abilities.

>     “(b)  __Purposes__  __.—__ 

>     The purposes of this Act \[see Tables for classification\] are as follows:

>         “(1) To provide health care and employment preparation and placement services to individuals with disabilities that will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.

>         “(2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain employment.

>         “(3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of maintaining medicare coverage while working.

>         “(4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.”
