    In the case of any State which has in effect a plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter for any calendar quarter, the total of the payments to which such State is entitled for such quarter, and for each succeeding quarter in the same fiscal year (which for purposes of this section means the 4 calendar quarters ending with September 30), under paragraphs (1) and (2) of sections 303(a), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  1203(a), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  1353(a), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  and 1383(a)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of this title shall, at the option of the State, be determined by application of the Federal medical assistance percentage (as defined in [section 1396d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d]), instead of the percentages provided under each such section, to the expenditures under its State plans approved under subchapters I, X, XIV, and XVI of this chapter, which would be included in determining the amounts of the Federal payments to which such State is entitled under such sections, but without regard to any maximum on the dollar amounts per recipient which may be counted under such sections.
