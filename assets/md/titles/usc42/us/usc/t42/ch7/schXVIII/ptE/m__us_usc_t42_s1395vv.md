## § 1395vv. Withholding payments from certain medicaid providers

    (a) __Adjustments by Secretary__ 

    The Secretary may adjust, in accordance with this section, payments under parts A and B to any institution which has in effect an agreement with the Secretary under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc], and any person who has accepted payment on the basis of an assignment under [section 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3/B/ii], where such institution or person—

        (1) has (or previously had) in effect an agreement with a State agency to furnish medical care and services under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and

        (2) from which (or from whom) such State agency (A) has been unable to recover overpayments made under the State plan, or (B) has been unable to collect the information necessary to enable it to determine the amount (if any) of the overpayments made to such institution or person under the State plan.

    (b) __Implementing regulations; notice, opportunity to be heard, etc.__ 

    The Secretary shall by regulation provide procedures for implementation of this section, which procedures shall—

        (1) assure that the authority under this section is exercised only on behalf of a State agency which demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that it has provided adequate notice of a determination or of a need for information, and an opportunity to appeal such determination or to provide such information,

        (2) determine the amount of the payment to which the institution or person would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter which shall be treated as a setoff against overpayments under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and

        (3) assure the restoration to the institution or person of amounts withheld under this section which are ultimately determined to be in excess of overpayments under subchapter XIX of this chapter and to which the institution or person would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter.

    (c) __Payment to States of amounts recovered__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, from the trust funds established under sections 1395i and 1395t of this title, as appropriate, the Secretary shall pay to the appropriate State agency amounts recovered under this section to offset the State agency’s overpayment under subchapter XIX of this chapter. Such payments shall be accounted for by the State agency as recoveries of overpayments under the State plan.
