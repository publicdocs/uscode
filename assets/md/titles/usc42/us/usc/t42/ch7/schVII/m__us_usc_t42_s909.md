    (a) __Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays__ 

        If the day regularly designated for the delivery of benefit checks under subchapter II, VIII, or XVI of this chapter falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday (as defined in [section 6103 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s6103]) in any month, the benefit checks which would otherwise be delivered on such day shall be mailed for delivery on the first day preceding such day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday (as so defined), without regard to whether the delivery of such checks would as a result have to be made before the end of the month for which such checks are issued.

    (b) __Recovery of overpayments__ 

        If more than the correct amount of payment under subchapter II, VIII, or XVI of this chapter is made to any individual as a result of the receipt of a benefit check pursuant to subsection (a) of this section before the end of the month for which such check is issued, no action shall be taken (under section 404 or 1383(b) of this title or otherwise) to recover such payment or the incorrect portion thereof.
