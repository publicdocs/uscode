## § 1320a–7l. Nationwide program for national and State background checks on direct patient access employees of long-term care facilities and providers

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the “Secretary”), shall establish a program to identify efficient, effective, and economical procedures for long term care facilities or providers to conduct background checks on prospective direct patient access employees on a nationwide basis (in this subsection, such program shall be referred to as the “nationwide program”). Except for the following modifications, the Secretary shall carry out the nationwide program under similar terms and conditions as the pilot program under section 307 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ([Public Law 108–173][/us/pl/108/173]; [117 Stat. 2257][/us/stat/117/2257]), including the prohibition on hiring abusive workers and the authorization of the imposition of penalties by a participating State under subsection (b)(3)(A) and (b)(6), respectively, of such section 307:

        (1) __Agreements__ 

            (A) __Newly participating States__ 

            The Secretary shall enter into agreements with each State—

                (i) that the Secretary has not entered into an agreement with under subsection (c)(1) of such section 307;

                (ii) that agrees to conduct background checks under the nationwide program on a Statewide basis; and

                (iii) that submits an application to the Secretary containing such information and at such time as the Secretary may specify.

            (B) __Certain previously participating States__ 

            The Secretary shall enter into agreements with each State—

                (i) that the Secretary has entered into an agreement with under such subsection (c)(1), but only in the case where such agreement did not require the State to conduct background checks under the program established under subsection (a) of such section 307 on a Statewide basis;

                (ii) that agrees to conduct background checks under the nationwide program on a Statewide basis; and

                (iii) that submits an application to the Secretary containing such information and at such time as the Secretary may specify.

        (2) __Nonapplication of selection criteria__ 

            The selection criteria required under subsection (c)(3)(B) of such section 307 shall not apply.

        (3) __Required fingerprint check as part of criminal history background check__ 

        The procedures established under subsection (b)(1) of such section 307 shall—

            (A) require that the long-term care facility or provider (or the designated agent of the long-term care facility or provider) obtain State and national criminal history background checks on the prospective employee through such means as the Secretary determines appropriate, efficient, and effective that utilize a search of State-based abuse and neglect registries and databases, including the abuse and neglect registries of another State in the case where a prospective employee previously resided in that State, State criminal history records, the records of any proceedings in the State that may contain disqualifying information about prospective employees (such as proceedings conducted by State professional licensing and disciplinary boards and State Medicaid Fraud Control Units), and Federal criminal history records, including a fingerprint check using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;

            (B) require States to describe and test methods that reduce duplicative fingerprinting, including providing for the development of “rap back” capability by the State such that, if a direct patient access employee of a long-term care facility or provider is convicted of a crime following the initial criminal history background check conducted with respect to such employee, and the employee’s fingerprints match the prints on file with the State law enforcement department, the department will immediately inform the State and the State will immediately inform the long-term care facility or provider which employs the direct patient access employee of such conviction; and

            (C) require that criminal history background checks conducted under the nationwide program remain valid for a period of time specified by the Secretary.

        (4) __State requirements__ 

        An agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall require that a participating State—

            (A) be responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirements of the nationwide program;

            (B)

             have procedures in place to—

                (i) conduct screening and criminal history background checks under the nationwide program in accordance with the requirements of this section;

                (ii) monitor compliance by long-term care facilities and providers with the procedures and requirements of the nationwide program;

                (iv) provide an independent process by which a provisional employee or an employee may appeal or dispute the accuracy of the information obtained in a background check performed under the nationwide program, including the specification of criteria for appeals for direct patient access employees found to have disqualifying information which shall include consideration of the passage of time, extenuating circumstances, demonstration of rehabilitation, and relevancy of the particular disqualifying information with respect to the current employment of the individual;

                (v)

                 provide for the designation of a single State agency as responsible for—

                    (I) overseeing the coordination of any State and national criminal history background checks requested by a long-term care facility or provider (or the designated agent of the long-term care facility or provider) utilizing a search of State and Federal criminal history records, including a fingerprint check of such records;

                    (II) overseeing the design of appropriate privacy and security safeguards for use in the review of the results of any State or national criminal history background checks conducted regarding a prospective direct patient access employee to determine whether the employee has any conviction for a relevant crime;

                    (III) immediately reporting to the long-term care facility or provider that requested the criminal history background check the results of such review; and

                    (IV) in the case of an employee with a conviction for a relevant crime that is subject to reporting under section 1128E of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1320a–7e][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7e]), reporting the existence of such conviction to the database established under that section;

                (vi) determine which individuals are direct patient access employees (as defined in paragraph (6)(B)) for purposes of the nationwide program;

                (vii) as appropriate, specify offenses, including convictions for violent crimes, for purposes of the nationwide program; and

                (viii)

                 describe and test methods that reduce duplicative fingerprinting, including providing for the development of “rap back” capability such that, if a direct patient access employee of a long-term care facility or provider is convicted of a crime following the initial criminal history background check conducted with respect to such employee, and the employee’s fingerprints match the prints on file with the State law enforcement department—

                    (I) the department will immediately inform the State agency designated under clause (v) and such agency will immediately inform the facility or provider which employs the direct patient access employee of such conviction; and

                    (II) the State will provide, or will require the facility to provide, to the employee a copy of the results of the criminal history background check conducted with respect to the employee at no charge in the case where the individual requests such a copy.
