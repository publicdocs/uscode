Paragraph (1) of the first sentence of this subsection shall apply with respect to a colorectal cancer screening test regardless of the code that is billed for the establishment of a diagnosis as a result of the test, or for the removal of tissue or other matter or other procedure that is furnished in connection with, as a result of, and in the same clinical encounter as the screening test.

    (c) __Mental disorders__ 

        (1)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, with respect to expenses incurred in a calendar year in connection with the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders of an individual who is not an inpatient of a hospital at the time such expenses are incurred, there shall be considered as incurred expenses for purposes of subsections (a) and (b)—

            (A) for expenses incurred in years prior to 2010, only 62½ percent of such expenses;

            (B) for expenses incurred in 2010 or 2011, only 68¾ percent of such expenses;

            (C) for expenses incurred in 2012, only 75 percent of such expenses;

            (D) for expenses incurred in 2013, only 81¼ percent of such expenses; and

            (E) for expenses incurred in 2014 or any subsequent calendar year, 100 percent of such expenses.

        (2) For purposes of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1), the term “treatment” does not include brief office visits (as defined by the Secretary) for the sole purpose of monitoring or changing drug prescriptions used in the treatment of such disorders or partial hospitalization services that are not directly provided by a physician.

    (d) __Nonduplication of payments__ 

        No payment may be made under this part with respect to any services furnished an individual to the extent that such individual is entitled (or would be entitled except for [section 1395e of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395e]) to have payment made with respect to such services under part A of this subchapter.

    (e) __Information for determination of amounts due__ 

        No payment shall be made to any provider of services or other person under this part unless there has been furnished such information as may be necessary in order to determine the amounts due such provider or other person under this part for the period with respect to which the amounts are being paid or for any prior period.

    (f) __Maximum rate of payment per visit for independent rural health clinics__ 

    In establishing limits under subsection (a) of this section on payment for rural health clinic services provided by rural health clinics (other than such clinics in hospitals with less than 50 beds), the Secretary shall establish such limit, for services provided—

        (1) in 1988, after March 31, at $46 per visit, and

        (2) in a subsequent year, at the limit established under this subsection for the previous year increased by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in [section 1395u(i)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/i/3]) applicable to primary care services (as defined in [section 1395u(i)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/i/4]) furnished as of the first day of that year.

    (g) __Physical therapy services__ 

        (1) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), in the case of physical therapy services of the type described in [section 1395x(p) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/p] and speech-language pathology services of the type described in such section through the application of section 1395x(ll)(2) of this title, but (except as provided in paragraph (6)) not described in subsection (a)(8)(B), and physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services of such type which are furnished by a physician or as incident to physicians’ services, with respect to expenses incurred in any calendar year, no more than the amount specified in paragraph (2) for the year shall be considered as incurred expenses for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

        (2)

         The amount specified in this paragraph—

            (A) for 1999, 2000, and 2001, is $1,500, and

            (B) for a subsequent year is the amount specified in this paragraph for the preceding year increased by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in [section 1395u(i)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/i/3]) for such subsequent year;

            except that if an increase under subparagraph (B) for a year is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.

        (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), in the case of occupational therapy services (of the type that are described in [section 1395x(p) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/p] (but (except as provided in paragraph (6)) not described in subsection (a)(8)(B)) through the operation of [section 1395x(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/g] and of such type which are furnished by a physician or as incident to physicians’ services), with respect to expenses incurred in any calendar year, no more than the amount specified in paragraph (2) for the year shall be considered as incurred expenses for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

        (4) This subsection shall not apply to expenses incurred with respect to services furnished during 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005.

        (5)

            (A) With respect to expenses incurred during the period beginning on January 1, 2006, and ending on December 31, 2013, for services, the Secretary shall implement a process under which an individual enrolled under this part may, upon request of the individual or a person on behalf of the individual, obtain an exception from the uniform dollar limitation specified in paragraph (2), for services described in paragraphs (1) and (3) if the provision of such services is determined to be medically necessary and if the requirement of subparagraph (B) is met. Under such process, if the Secretary does not make a decision on such a request for an exception within 10 business days of the date of the Secretary’s receipt of the request made in accordance with such requirement, the Secretary shall be deemed to have found the services to be medically necessary.

            (B) In the case of outpatient therapy services for which an exception is requested under the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the claim for such services shall contain an appropriate modifier (such as the KX modifier used as of February 22, 2012) indicating that such services are medically necessary as justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record involved.

            (C)

                (i) In applying this paragraph with respect to a request for an exception with respect to expenses that would be incurred for outpatient therapy services (including services described in subsection (a)(8)(B)) that would exceed the threshold described in clause (ii) for a year, the request for such an exception, for services furnished on or after October 1, 2012, shall be subject to a manual medical review process that is similar to the manual medical review process used for certain exceptions under this paragraph in 2006.

                (ii)

                 The threshold under this clause for a year is $3,700. Such threshold shall be applied separately—

                    (I) for physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services; and

                    (II) for occupational therapy services.

            (D) With respect to services furnished on or after January 1, 2013, where payment may not be made as a result of application of paragraphs (1) and (3), [section 1395pp of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395pp] shall apply in the same manner as such section applies to a denial that is made by reason of [section 1395y(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395y/a/1].

        (6)

            (A) In applying paragraphs (1) and (3) to services furnished during the period beginning not later than October 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2013, the exclusion of services described in subsection (a)(8)(B) from the uniform dollar limitation specified in paragraph (2) shall not apply to such services furnished during 2012 or 2013.

            (B)

                (i) With respect to outpatient therapy services furnished beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2014, for which payment is made under [section 1395m(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/g], the Secretary shall count toward the uniform dollar limitations described in paragraphs (1) and (3) and the threshold described in paragraph (5)(C) the amount that would be payable under this part if such services were paid under [section 1395m(k)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/k/1/B] instead of being paid under [section 1395m(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/g].

                (ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed as changing the method of payment for outpatient therapy services under [section 1395m(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/g].

    (h) __Fee schedules for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests; percentage of prevailing charge level; nominal fee for samples; adjustments; recipients of payments; negotiated payment rate__ 

        (1)

            (A) Subject to [section 1395m(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/d/1], the Secretary shall establish fee schedules for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (including prostate cancer screening tests under section 1395x(oo) of this title consisting of prostate-specific antigen blood tests) for which payment is made under this part, other than such tests performed by a provider of services for an inpatient of such provider.

            (B) In the case of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests performed by a physician or by a laboratory (other than tests performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for outpatients of such hospital), the fee schedules established under subparagraph (A) shall be established on a regional, statewide, or carrier service area basis (as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate) for tests furnished on or after July 1, 1984.

            (C) In the case of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for outpatients of such hospital, the fee schedules established under subparagraph (A) shall be established on a regional, statewide, or carrier service area basis (as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate) for tests furnished on or after July 1, 1984.

            (D) In this subsection, the term “qualified hospital laboratory” means a hospital laboratory, in a sole community hospital (as defined in [section 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/d/5/D/iii]), which provides some clinical diagnostic laboratory tests 24 hours a day in order to serve a hospital emergency room which is available to provide services 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

        (2)

            (A)

                (i) Except as provided in clause (v), subparagraph (B), and paragraph (4), the Secretary shall set the fee schedules at 60 percent (or, in the case of a test performed by a qualified hospital laboratory (as defined in paragraph (1)(D)) for outpatients of such hospital, 62 percent) of the prevailing charge level determined pursuant to the third and fourth sentences of [section 1395u(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3] for similar clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for the applicable region, State, or area for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1984, adjusted annually (to become effective on January 1 of each year) by, subject to clause (iv), a percentage increase or decrease equal to the percentage increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (United States city average) minus, for each of the years 2009 and 2010, 0.5 percentage points, and subject to such other adjustments as the Secretary determines are justified by technological changes.

                (ii)

                 Notwithstanding clause (i)—

                    (I) any change in the fee schedules which would have become effective under this subsection for tests furnished on or after January 1, 1988, shall not be effective for tests furnished during the 3-month period beginning on January 1, 1988,

                    (II) the Secretary shall not adjust the fee schedules under clause (i) to take into account any increase in the consumer price index for 1988,

                    (III) the annual adjustment in the fee schedules determined under clause (i) for each of the years 1991, 1992, and 1993 shall be 2 percent, and

                    (IV) the annual adjustment in the fee schedules determined under clause (i) for each of the years 1994 and 1995, 1998 through 2002, and 2004 through 2008 shall be 0 percent.

                (iii) In establishing fee schedules under clause (i) with respect to automated tests and tests (other than cytopathology tests) which before July 1, 1984, the Secretary made subject to a limit based on lowest charge levels under the sixth sentence of [section 1395u(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3] performed after March 31, 1988, the Secretary shall reduce by 8.3 percent the fee schedules otherwise established for 1988, and such reduced fee schedules shall serve as the base for 1989 and subsequent years.

                (iv)

                 After determining the adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i), the Secretary shall reduce such adjustment—

                    (I) for 2011 and each subsequent year, by the productivity adjustment described in [section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/b/3/B/xi/II]; and

                    (II) for each of 2011 through 2015, by 1.75 percentage points.

                    Subclause (I) shall not apply in a year where the adjustment to the fee schedules determined under clause (i) is 0.0 or a percentage decrease for a year. The application of the productivity adjustment under subclause (I) shall not result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year. The application of subclause (II) may result in an adjustment to the fee schedules under clause (i) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

                (v) The Secretary shall reduce by 2 percent the fee schedules otherwise determined under clause (i) for 2013, and such reduced fee schedules shall serve as the base for 2014 and subsequent years.

            (B) The Secretary may make further adjustments or exceptions to the fee schedules to assure adequate reimbursement of (i) emergency laboratory tests needed for the provision of bona fide emergency services, and (ii) certain low volume high-cost tests where highly sophisticated equipment or extremely skilled personnel are necessary to assure quality.

        (3) In addition to the amounts provided under the fee schedules, the Secretary shall provide for and establish (A) a nominal fee to cover the appropriate costs in collecting the sample on which a clinical diagnostic laboratory test was performed and for which payment is made under this part, except that not more than one such fee may be provided under this paragraph with respect to samples collected in the same encounter, and (B) a fee to cover the transportation and personnel expenses for trained personnel to travel to the location of an individual to collect the sample, except that such a fee may be provided only with respect to an individual who is homebound or an inpatient in an inpatient facility (other than a hospital). In establishing a fee to cover the transportation and personnel expenses for trained personnel to travel to the location of an individual to collect a sample, the Secretary shall provide a method for computing the fee based on the number of miles traveled and the personnel costs associated with the collection of each individual sample, but the Secretary shall only be required to apply such method in the case of tests furnished during the period beginning on April 1, 1989, and ending on December 31, 1990, by a laboratory that establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary (based on data for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1988) that (i) the laboratory is dependent upon payments under this subchapter for at least 80 percent of its collected revenues for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, (ii) at least 85 percent of its gross revenues for such tests are attributable to tests performed with respect to individuals who are homebound or who are residents in a nursing facility, and (iii) the laboratory provided such tests for residents in nursing facilities representing at least 20 percent of the number of such facilities in the State in which the laboratory is located.

        (4)

            (A) In establishing any fee schedule under this subsection, the Secretary may provide for an adjustment to take into account, with respect to the portion of the expenses of clinical diagnostic laboratory tests attributable to wages, the relative difference between a region’s or local area’s wage rates and the wage rate presumed in the data on which the schedule is based.

            (B)

             For purposes of subsections (a)(1)(D)(i) and (a)(2)(D)(i) of this section, the limitation amount for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test performed—

                (i) on or after July 1, 1986, and before April 1, 1988, is equal to 115 percent of the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

                (ii) after March 31, 1988, and before January 1, 1990, is equal to the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

                (iii) after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 1991, is equal to 93 percent of the median of all the fee schedules established for that test for that laboratory setting under paragraph (1),

                (iv) after December 31, 1990, and before January 1, 1994, is equal to 88 percent of such median,

                (v) after December 31, 1993, and before January 1, 1995, is equal to 84 percent of such median,

                (vi) after December 31, 1994, and before January 1, 1996, is equal to 80 percent of such median,

                (vii) after December 31, 1995, and before January 1, 1998, is equal to 76 percent of such median, and

                (viii) after December 31, 1997, is equal to 74 percent of such median (or 100 percent of such median in the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test performed on or after January 1, 2001, that the Secretary determines is a new test for which no limitation amount has previously been established under this subparagraph).

        (5)

            (A)

             In the case of a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part on an assignment-related basis or under a provider agreement under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc], payment may be made only to the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of such test; except that—

                (i) if a physician performed or supervised the performance of such test, payment may be made to another physician with whom he shares his practice,

                (ii)

                 in the case of a test performed at the request of a laboratory by another laboratory, payment may be made to the referring laboratory but only if—

                    (I) the referring laboratory is located in, or is part of, a rural hospital,

                    (II) the referring laboratory is wholly owned by the entity performing such test, the referring laboratory wholly owns the entity performing such test, or both the referring laboratory and the entity performing such test are wholly-owned by a third entity, or

                    (III) not more than 30 percent of the clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for which such referring laboratory (but not including a laboratory described in subclause (II)), <sup>\[4\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 4 So in original. The comma after “subclause (II))” probably should follow “is performed”. </sup></sup>  receives requests for testing during the year in which the test is performed  <sup>\[4\]</sup>  are performed by another laboratory, and

                (iii) in the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test provided under an arrangement (as defined in [section 1395x(w)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/w/1]) made by a hospital, critical access hospital, or skilled nursing facility, payment shall be made to the hospital or skilled nursing facility.

            (B) In the case of such a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part, and which is not described in subparagraph (A), payment may be made to the beneficiary only on the basis of the itemized bill of the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of the test.

            (C) Payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician’s office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic may only be made on an assignment-related basis or to a provider of services with an agreement in effect under [section 1395cc of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc].

            (D) A person may not bill for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician’s office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic, other than on an assignment-related basis. If a person knowingly and willfully and on a repeated basis bills for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test in violation of the previous sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the person in the same manner as the Secretary may apply sanctions against a physician in accordance with paragraph (2) of [section 1395u(j) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/j] in the same manner such paragraphs apply  <sup>\[5\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 5 So in original. Probably should be “such paragraph applies”. </sup></sup>  with respect to a physician. Paragraph (4) of such section shall apply in this subparagraph in the same manner as such paragraph applies to such section.

        (6) In the case of any diagnostic laboratory test payment for which is not made on the basis of a fee schedule under paragraph (1), the Secretary may establish a payment rate which is acceptable to the person or entity performing the test and which would be considered the full charge for such tests. Such negotiated rate shall be limited to an amount not in excess of the total payment that would have been made for the services in the absence of such rate.

        (7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4), the Secretary shall establish a national minimum payment amount under this subsection for a diagnostic or screening pap smear laboratory test (including all cervical cancer screening technologies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a primary screening method for detection of cervical cancer) equal to $14.60 for tests furnished in 2000. For such tests furnished in subsequent years, such national minimum payment amount shall be adjusted annually as provided in paragraph (2).

        (8)

            (A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for determining the basis for, and amount of, payment under this subsection for any clinical diagnostic laboratory test with respect to which a new or substantially revised HCPCS code is assigned on or after January 1, 2005 (in this paragraph referred to as “new tests”).

            (B)

             Determinations under subparagraph (A) shall be made only after the Secretary—

                (i) makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list that includes any such test for which establishment of a payment amount under this subsection is being considered for a year;

                (ii) on the same day such list is made available, causes to have published in the Federal Register notice of a meeting to receive comments and recommendations (and data on which recommendations are based) from the public on the appropriate basis under this subsection for establishing payment amounts for the tests on such list;

                (iii) not less than 30 days after publication of such notice convenes a meeting, that includes representatives of officials of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services involved in determining payment amounts, to receive such comments and recommendations (and data on which the recommendations are based);

                (iv) taking into account the comments and recommendations (and accompanying data) received at such meeting, develops and makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list of proposed determinations with respect to the appropriate basis for establishing a payment amount under this subsection for each such code, together with an explanation of the reasons for each such determination, the data on which the determinations are based, and a request for public written comments on the proposed determination; and

                (v) taking into account the comments received during the public comment period, develops and makes available to the public (through an Internet website and other appropriate mechanisms) a list of final determinations of the payment amounts for such tests under this subsection, together with the rationale for each such determination, the data on which the determinations are based, and responses to comments and suggestions received from the public.

            (C)

             Under the procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—

                (i) set forth the criteria for making determinations under subparagraph (A); and

                (ii) make available to the public the data (other than proprietary data) considered in making such determinations.

            (D) The Secretary may convene such further public meetings to receive public comments on payment amounts for new tests under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate.

            (E)

             For purposes of this paragraph:

                (i) The term “HCPCS” refers to the Health Care Procedure Coding System.

                (ii) A code shall be considered to be “substantially revised” if there is a substantive change to the definition of the test or procedure to which the code applies (such as a new analyte or a new methodology for measuring an existing analyte-specific test).

        (9) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test for HbA1c that is labeled by the Food and Drug Administration for home use and is furnished on or after April 1, 2008, the payment rate for such test shall be the payment rate established under this part for a glycated hemoglobin test (identified as of October 1, 2007, by HCPCS code 83036 (and any succeeding codes)).

    (i) __Outpatient surgery__ 

        (1)

         The Secretary shall, in consultation with appropriate medical organizations—

            (A) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in an ambulatory surgical center (meeting the standards specified under [section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395k/a/2/F/i]), critical access hospital, or hospital outpatient department, and

            (B) specify those surgical procedures which are appropriately (when considered in terms of the proper utilization of hospital inpatient facilities) performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital but which also can be performed safely on an ambulatory basis in a physician’s office.

            The lists of procedures established under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be reviewed and updated not less often than every 2 years, in consultation with appropriate trade and professional organizations.

        (2)

            (A)

             For services furnished prior to the implementation of the system described in subparagraph (D), subject to subparagraph (E), the amount of payment to be made for facility services furnished in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) and furnished to an individual in an ambulatory surgical center described in such paragraph shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary’s estimate of a fair fee which—

                (i) takes into account the costs incurred by such centers, or classes of centers, generally in providing services furnished in connection with the performance of such procedure, as determined in accordance with a survey (based upon a representative sample of procedures and facilities) of the actual audited costs incurred by such centers in providing such services,

                (ii) takes such costs into account in such a manner as will assure that the performance of the procedure in such a center will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the procedure had been performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital, and

                (iii) in the case of insertion of an intraocular lens during or subsequent to cataract surgery includes payment which is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved.

                Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.

            (B)

             The amount of payment to be made under this part for facility services furnished, in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), in a physician’s office shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary’s estimate of a fair fee which—

                (i) takes into account additional costs, not usually included in the professional fee, incurred by physicians in securing, maintaining, and staffing the facilities and ancillary services appropriate for the performance of such procedure in the physician’s office, and

                (ii) takes such items into account in such a manner which will assure that the performance of such procedure in the physician’s office will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the services had been furnished on an inpatient basis in a hospital.

                Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987, and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.

            (C)

                (i) Notwithstanding the second sentence of each of subparagraphs (A) and (B), except as otherwise specified in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), if the Secretary has not updated amounts established under such subparagraphs or under subparagraph (D), with respect to facility services furnished during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986 or a calendar year (beginning with 2006)), such amounts shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the year involved.

                (ii) In each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the increase under this subparagraph shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2.0 percentage points.

                (iii) In fiscal year 2004, beginning with April 1, 2004, the increase under this subparagraph shall be the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with March 31, 2003, minus 3.0 percentage points.

                (iv) In fiscal year 2005, the last quarter of calendar year 2005, and each of calendar years 2006 through 2009, the increase under this subparagraph shall be 0 percent.

            (D)

                (i) Taking into account the recommendations in the report under section 626(d) of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary shall implement a revised payment system for payment of surgical services furnished in ambulatory surgical centers.

                (ii) In the year the system described in clause (i) is implemented, such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services as would be made if this subparagraph did not apply, as estimated by the Secretary and taking into account reduced expenditures that would apply if subparagraph (E) were to continue to apply, as estimated by the Secretary.

                (iii) The Secretary shall implement the system described in clause (i) for periods in a manner so that it is first effective beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and not later than January 1, 2008.

                (iv) The Secretary may implement such system in a manner so as to provide for a reduction in any annual update for failure to report on quality measures in accordance with paragraph (7).

                (v) In implementing the system described in clause (i) for 2011 and each subsequent year, any annual update under such system for the year, after application of clause (iv), shall be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in [section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/b/3/B/xi/II]. The application of the preceding sentence may result in such update being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the system described in clause (i) for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

                (vi) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff, 1395oo of this title, or otherwise, of the classification system, the relative weights, payment amounts, and the geographic adjustment factor, if any, under this subparagraph.

            (E)

             With respect to surgical procedures furnished on or after January 1, 2007, and before the effective date of the implementation of a revised payment system under subparagraph (D), if—

                (i) the standard overhead amount under subparagraph (A) for a facility service for such procedure, without the application of any geographic adjustment, exceeds

                (ii) the Medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services under paragraph (3)(D) of subsection (t) for such service for such year, determined without regard to geographic adjustment under paragraph (2)(D) of such subsection,

                the Secretary shall substitute under subparagraph (A) the amount described in clause (ii) for the standard overhead amount for such service referred to in clause (i).

        (3)

            (A)

             The aggregate amount of the payments to be made under this part for outpatient hospital facility services or critical access hospital services furnished before January 1, 1999, in connection with surgical procedures specified under paragraph (1)(A) shall be equal to the lesser of—

                 The blend amount for a cost reporting period is the sum of—

                    (I) the cost proportion (as defined in clause (ii)(I)) of the amount described in subparagraph (A)(i), and

                    (II) the ASC proportion (as defined in clause (ii)(II)) of the standard overhead amount payable with respect to the same surgical procedure as if it were provided in an ambulatory surgical center in the same area, as determined under paragraph (2)(A), less the amount a provider may charge as described in clause (ii) of [section 1395cc(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc/a/2/A].

        (5)

            (A) The Secretary is authorized to provide by regulations that in the case of a surgical procedure, specified by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), performed in an ambulatory surgical center described in such paragraph, there shall be paid (in lieu of any amounts otherwise payable under this part) with respect to the facility services furnished by such center and with respect to all related services (including physicians’ services, laboratory, X-ray, and diagnostic services) a single all-inclusive fee established pursuant to subparagraph (B), if all parties furnishing all such services agree to accept such fee (to be divided among the parties involved in such manner as they shall have previously agreed upon) as full payment for the services furnished.

            (B) In implementing this paragraph, the Secretary shall establish with respect to each surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) the amount of the all-inclusive fee for such procedure, taking into account such factors as may be appropriate.

        (7)

            (A) For purposes of paragraph (2)(D)(iv), the Secretary may provide, in the case of an ambulatory surgical center that does not submit, to the Secretary in accordance with this paragraph, data required to be submitted on measures selected under this paragraph with respect to a year, any annual increase provided under the system established under paragraph (2)(D) for such year shall be reduced by 2.0 percentage points. A reduction under this subparagraph shall apply only with respect to the year involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing any annual increase factor for a subsequent year.

            (B) Except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, the provisions of subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (17) of subsection (t) shall apply with respect to services of ambulatory surgical centers under this paragraph in a similar manner to the manner in which they apply under such paragraph and, for purposes of this subparagraph, any reference to a hospital, outpatient setting, or outpatient hospital services is deemed a reference to an ambulatory surgical center, the setting of such a center, or services of such a center, respectively.

    (j) __Accrual of interest on balance of excess or deficit not paid__ 

        Whenever a final determination is made that the amount of payment made under this part either to a provider of services or to another person pursuant to an assignment under [section 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3/B/ii] was in excess of or less than the amount of payment that is due, and payment of such excess or deficit is not made (or effected by offset) within 30 days of the date of the determination, interest shall accrue on the balance of such excess or deficit not paid or offset (to the extent that the balance is owed by or owing to the provider) at a rate determined in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury applicable to charges for late payments.

        (3)

            (A) In establishing the initial fee schedule for those services, the Secretary shall adjust the fee schedule to the extent necessary to ensure that the estimated total amount which will be paid under this subchapter for those services plus applicable coinsurance in 1989 will equal the estimated total amount which would be paid under this subchapter for those services in 1989 if the services were included as inpatient hospital services and payment for such services was made under part A of this subchapter in the same manner as payment was made in fiscal year 1987, adjusted to take into account changes in prices and technology relating to the administration of anesthesia.

            (B) The Secretary shall also reduce the prevailing charge of physicians for medical direction of a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or the fee schedule for services of certified registered nurse anesthetists, or both, to the extent necessary to ensure that the estimated total amount which will be paid under this subchapter plus applicable coinsurance for such medical direction and such services in 1989 and 1990 will not exceed the estimated total amount which would have been paid plus applicable coinsurance but for the enactment of the amendments made by section 9320 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. A reduced prevailing charge under this subparagraph shall become the prevailing charge but for subsequent years for purposes of applying the economic index under the fourth sentence of [section 1395u(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395u/b/3].

                The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to civil money penalties under clause (i) in the same manner as they apply to a penalty or proceeding under [section 1320a–7a(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/a].

    (r) __Cap on prevailing charge; billing on assignment-related basis__ 

        (1) With respect to services described in [section 1395x(s)(2)(K)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/s/2/K/ii] (relating to nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist services), payment may be made on the basis of a claim or request for payment presented by the nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist furnishing such services, or by a hospital, critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility or nursing facility (as defined in [section 1396r(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396r/a]), physician, group practice, or ambulatory surgical center with which the nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist has an employment or contractual relationship that provides for payment to be made under this part for such services to such hospital, physician, group practice, or ambulatory surgical center.

        (2) No hospital or critical access hospital that presents a claim or request for payment under this part for services described in [section 1395x(s)(2)(K)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/s/2/K/ii] may treat any uncollected coinsurance amount imposed under this part with respect to such services as a bad debt of such hospital for purposes of this subchapter.

    (s) __Other prepaid organizations__ 

        The Secretary may not provide for payment under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section with respect to an organization unless the organization provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the organization meets the requirement of [section 1395cc(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc/f] (relating to maintaining written policies and procedures respecting advance directives).

    (t) __Prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services__ 

        (1) __Amount of payment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                With respect to covered OPD services (as defined in subparagraph (B)) furnished during a year beginning with 1999, the amount of payment under this part shall be determined under a prospective payment system established by the Secretary in accordance with this subsection.

            (B) __Definition of covered OPD services__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “covered OPD services”—

                (i) means hospital outpatient services designated by the Secretary;

                (ii) subject to clause (iv), includes inpatient hospital services designated by the Secretary that are covered under this part and furnished to a hospital inpatient who (I) is entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter but has exhausted benefits for inpatient hospital services during a spell of illness, or (II) is not so entitled;

                (iii) includes implantable items described in paragraph (3), (6), or (8) of [section 1395x(s) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/s]; but

                (iv) does not include any therapy services described in subsection (a)(8) of this section or ambulance services, for which payment is made under a fee schedule described in [section 1395m(k) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395m/k] or section 1395m(l) of this title and does not include screening mammography (as defined in [section 1395x(jj) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/jj]), diagnostic mammography, or personalized prevention plan services (as defined in [section 1395x(hhh)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/hhh/1]).

        (2) __System requirements__ 

        Under the payment system—

            (A) the Secretary shall develop a classification system for covered OPD services;

            (B) the Secretary may establish groups of covered OPD services, within the classification system described in subparagraph (A), so that services classified within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources and so that an implantable item is classified to the group that includes the service to which the item relates;

            (C) the Secretary shall, using data on claims from 1996 and using data from the most recent available cost reports, establish relative payment weights for covered OPD services (and any groups of such services described in subparagraph (B)) based on median (or, at the election of the Secretary, mean) hospital costs and shall determine projections of the frequency of utilization of each such service (or group of services) in 1999;

            (D) subject to paragraph (19), the Secretary shall determine a wage adjustment factor to adjust the portion of payment and coinsurance attributable to labor-related costs for relative differences in labor and labor-related costs across geographic regions in a budget neutral manner;

            (E) the Secretary shall establish, in a budget neutral manner, outlier adjustments under paragraph (5) and transitional pass-through payments under paragraph (6) and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments, such as adjustments for certain classes of hospitals;

            (F) the Secretary shall develop a method for controlling unnecessary increases in the volume of covered OPD services;

            (G) the Secretary shall create additional groups of covered OPD services that classify separately those procedures that utilize contrast agents from those that do not; and

            (H) with respect to devices of brachytherapy consisting of a seed or seeds (or radioactive source), the Secretary shall create additional groups of covered OPD services that classify such devices separately from the other services (or group of services) paid for under this subsection in a manner reflecting the number, isotope, and radioactive intensity of such devices furnished, including separate groups for palladium-103 and iodine-125 devices and for stranded and non-stranded devices furnished on or after July 1, 2007.

            For purposes of subparagraph (B), items and services within a group shall not be treated as “comparable with respect to the use of resources” if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary under subparagraph (C)) for an item or service within the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if so elected) for an item or service within the group; except that the Secretary may make exceptions in unusual cases, such as low volume items and services, but may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under [section 360bb of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360bb].

        (3) __Calculation of base amounts__ 

            (A) __Aggregate amounts that would be payable if deductibles were disregarded__ 

            The Secretary shall estimate the sum of—

                (i) the total amounts that would be payable from the Trust Fund under this part for covered OPD services in 1999, determined without regard to this subsection, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply, and

                (ii) the total amounts of copayments estimated to be paid under this subsection by beneficiaries to hospitals for covered OPD services in 1999, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply.

            (B) __Unadjusted copayment amount__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the “unadjusted copayment amount” applicable to a covered OPD service (or group of such services) is 20 percent of the national median of the charges for the service (or services within the group) furnished during 1996, updated to 1999 using the Secretary’s estimate of charge growth during the period.

                (ii) __Adjusted to be 20 percent when fully phased in__ 

                    If the pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year would be equal to or exceed 80 percent, then the unadjusted copayment amount shall be 20 percent of amount determined under subparagraph (D).

                (iii) __Rules for new services__ 

                    The Secretary shall establish rules for establishment of an unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service not furnished during 1996, based upon its classification within a group of such services.

            (C) __Calculation of conversion factors__ 

                (i) __For 1999__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A).

                    (II) __Product described__ 

                        The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group.

                (ii) __Subsequent years__ 

                    Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iv) for the year involved.

                (iii) __Adjustment for service mix changes__ 

                    Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

                (iv) __OPD fee schedule increase factor__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, subject to paragraph (17) and subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the “OPD fee schedule increase factor” for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under [section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/b/3/B/iii] to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.

            (D) __Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts__ 

            The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of—

                (i) the conversion factor computed under subparagraph (C) for the year, and

                (ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group.

            (E) __Pre-deductible payment percentage__ 

            The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of—

                (i) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under subparagraph (D) for the year, minus the unadjusted copayment amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the service or group, to

                (ii) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (D) for the year for such service or group.

            (F) __Productivity and other adjustment__ 

            After determining the OPD fee schedule increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor—

                (i) for 2012 and subsequent years, by the productivity adjustment described in [section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ww/b/3/B/xi/II]; and

                (ii) for each of 2010 through 2019, by the adjustment described in subparagraph (G).

                The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

            (G) __Other adjustment__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (F)(ii), the adjustment described in this subparagraph is—

                (i) for each of 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;

                (ii) for each of 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;

                (iii) for 2014, 0.3 percentage point;

                (iv) for each of 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and

                (v) for each of 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point.

        (4) __Medicare payment amount__ 

        The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows:

            (A) __Fee schedule adjustments__ 

                The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E).

            (B) __Subtract applicable deductible__ 

                Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b) of this section, to the extent applicable.

            (C) __Apply payment proportion to remainder__ 

                The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).

        (5) __Outlier adjustment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital’s charges, adjusted to cost, exceed—

                (i)

                 a fixed multiple of the sum of—

                    (I) the applicable medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (3)(D), as adjusted under paragraph (4)(A) (other than for adjustments under this paragraph or paragraph (6)); and

                    (II) any transitional pass-through payment under paragraph (6); and

                (ii) at the option of the Secretary, such fixed dollar amount as the Secretary may establish.

            (B) __Amount of adjustment__ 

                The amount of the additional payment under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the applicable cutoff point under such subparagraph.

            (C) __Limit on aggregate outlier adjustments__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.

                (ii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of clause (i), the term “applicable percentage” means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)—

                    (I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and

                    (II) for 2004 and thereafter, 3.0 percent.

            (D) __Transitional authority__ 

            In applying subparagraph (A) for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002, the Secretary may—

                (i) apply such subparagraph to a bill for such services related to an outpatient encounter (rather than for a specific service or group of services) using OPD fee schedule amounts and transitional pass-through payments covered under the bill; and

                (ii) use an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio for the hospital involved (as determined by the Secretary), rather than for specific departments within the hospital.

            (E) __Exclusion of separate drug and biological APCS from outlier payments__ 

                No additional payment shall be made under subparagraph (A) in the case of ambulatory payment classification groups established separately for drugs or biologicals.

        (6) __Transitional pass-through for additional costs of innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment under this paragraph for any of the following that are provided as part of a covered OPD service (or group of services):

                (i) __Current orphan drugs__ 

                    A drug or biological that is used for a rare disease or condition with respect to which the drug or biological has been designated as an orphan drug under [section 360bb of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360bb] if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on the first date that the system under this subsection is implemented.

                (ii) __Current cancer therapy drugs and biologicals and brachytherapy__ 

                    A drug or biological that is used in cancer therapy, including (but not limited to) a chemotherapeutic agent, an antiemetic, a hematopoietic growth factor, a colony stimulating factor, a biological response modifier, a bisphosphonate, and a device of brachytherapy or temperature monitored cryoablation, if payment for such drug, biological, or device as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

                (iii) __Current radiopharmaceutical drugs and biological products__ 

                    A radiopharmaceutical drug or biological product used in diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

                (iv) __New medical devices, drugs, and biologicals__ 

                A medical device, drug, or biological not described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) if—

                    (I) payment for the device, drug, or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was not being made as of December 31, 1996; and

                    (II) the cost of the drug or biological or the average cost of the category of devices is not insignificant in relation to the OPD fee schedule amount (as calculated under paragraph (3)(D)) payable for the service (or group of services) involved.

            (B) __Use of categories in determining eligibility of a device for pass-through payments__ 

            The following provisions apply for purposes of determining whether a medical device qualifies for additional payments under clause (ii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A):

                (i) __Establishment of initial categories__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The Secretary shall initially establish under this clause categories of medical devices based on type of device by April 1, 2001. Such categories shall be established in a manner such that each medical device that meets the requirements of clause (ii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A) as of January 1, 2001, is included in such a category and no such device is included in more than one category. For purposes of the preceding sentence, whether a medical device meets such requirements as of such date shall be determined on the basis of the program memoranda issued before such date.

                    (II) __Authorization of implementation other than through regulations__ 

                        The categories may be established under this clause by program memorandum or otherwise, after consultation with groups representing hospitals, manufacturers of medical devices, and other affected parties.

                (ii) __Establishing criteria for additional categories__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The Secretary shall establish criteria that will be used for creation of additional categories (other than those established under clause (i)) through rulemaking (which may include use of an interim final rule with comment period).

                    (II) __Standard__ 

                        Such categories shall be established under this clause in a manner such that no medical device is described by more than one category. Such criteria shall include a test of whether the average cost of devices that would be included in a category and are in use at the time the category is established is not insignificant, as described in subparagraph (A)(iv)(II).

                    (III) __Deadline__ 

                        Criteria shall first be established under this clause by July 1, 2001. The Secretary may establish in compelling circumstances categories under this clause before the date such criteria are established.

                    (IV) __Adding categories__ 

                        The Secretary shall promptly establish a new category of medical devices under this clause for any medical device that meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iv) and for which none of the categories in effect (or that were previously in effect) is appropriate.

                (iii) __Period for which category is in effect__ 

                A category of medical devices established under clause (i) or (ii) shall be in effect for a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, that begins—

                    (I) in the case of a category established under clause (i), on the first date on which payment was made under this paragraph for any device described by such category (including payments made during the period before April 1, 2001); and

                    (II) in the case of any other category, on the first date on which payment is made under this paragraph for any medical device that is described by such category.

                (iv) __Requirements treated as met__ 

                A medical device shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iv), regardless of whether the device meets the requirement of subclause (I) of such subparagraph, if—

                    (I) the device is described by a category established and in effect under clause (i); or

                    (II) the device is described by a category established and in effect under clause (ii) and an application under [section 360e of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360e] has been approved with respect to the device, or the device has been cleared for market under [section 360(k) of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360/k], or the device is exempt from the requirements of [section 360(k) of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360/k] pursuant to subsection (l) or (m) of [section 360 of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360] or [section 360j(g) of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s360j/g].

                 Nothing in this clause shall be construed as requiring an application or prior approval (other than that described in subclause (II)) in order for a covered device described by a category to qualify for payment under this paragraph.

            (C) __Limited period of payment__ 

                (i) __Drugs and biologicals__ 

                The payment under this paragraph with respect to a drug or biological shall only apply during a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, that begins—

                    (I) on the first date this subsection is implemented in the case of a drug or biological described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A) and in the case of a drug or biological described in subparagraph (A)(iv) and for which payment under this part is made as an outpatient hospital service before such first date; or

                    (II) in the case of a drug or biological described in subparagraph (A)(iv) not described in subclause (I), on the first date on which payment is made under this part for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service.

                (ii) __Medical devices__ 

                Payment shall be made under this paragraph with respect to a medical device only if such device—

                    (I) is described by a category of medical devices established and in effect under subparagraph (B); and

                    (II) is provided as part of a service (or group of services) paid for under this subsection and provided during the period for which such category is in effect under such subparagraph.

            (D) __Amount of additional payment__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (E)(iii), the amount of the payment under this paragraph with respect to a device, drug, or biological provided as part of a covered OPD service is—

                (i) in the case of a drug or biological, the amount by which the amount determined under section 1395u(o) of this title (or if the drug or biological is covered under a competitive acquisition contract under [section 1395w–3b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3b], an amount determined by the Secretary equal to the average price for the drug or biological for all competitive acquisition areas and year established under such section as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph) for the drug or biological exceeds the portion of the otherwise applicable medicare OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is associated with the drug or biological; or

                (ii) in the case of a medical device, the amount by which the hospital’s charges for the device, adjusted to cost, exceeds the portion of the otherwise applicable medicare OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is associated with the device.

            (E) __Limit on aggregate annual adjustment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.

                (ii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of clause (i), the term “applicable percentage” means—

                    (I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and

                    (II) for 2004 and thereafter, a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed) 2.0 percent.

                (iii) __Uniform prospective reduction if aggregate limit projected to be exceeded__ 

                    If the Secretary estimates before the beginning of a year that the amount of the additional payments under this paragraph for the year (or portion thereof) as determined under clause (i) without regard to this clause will exceed the limit established under such clause, the Secretary shall reduce pro rata the amount of each of the additional payments under this paragraph for that year (or portion thereof) in order to ensure that the aggregate additional payments under this paragraph (as so estimated) do not exceed such limit.

            (F) __Limitation of application of functional equivalence standard__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Secretary may not publish regulations that apply a functional equivalence standard to a drug or biological under this paragraph.

                (ii) __Application__ 

                Clause (i) shall apply to the application of a functional equivalence standard to a drug or biological on or after December 8, 2003, unless—

                    (I) such application was being made to such drug or biological prior to December 8, 2003; and

                    (II) the Secretary applies such standard to such drug or biological only for the purpose of determining eligibility of such drug or biological for additional payments under this paragraph and not for the purpose of any other payments under this subchapter.

                (iii) __Rule of construction__ 

                    Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to effect the Secretary’s authority to deem a particular drug to be identical to another drug if the 2 products are pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, as determined by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.

        (7) __Transitional adjustment to limit decline in payment__ 

            (A) __Before 2002__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (D), for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002, for which the PPS amount (as defined in subparagraph (E)) is—

                (i) at least 90 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the pre-BBA amount (as defined in subparagraph (F)), the amount of payment under this subsection shall be increased by 80 percent of the amount of such difference;

                (ii) at least 80 percent, but less than 90 percent, of the pre-BBA amount, the amount of payment under this subsection shall be increased by the amount by which (I) the product of 0.71 and the pre-BBA amount, exceeds (II) the product of 0.70 and the PPS amount;

                (iii) at least 70 percent, but less than 80 percent, of the pre-BBA amount, the amount of payment under this subsection shall be increased by the amount by which (I) the product of 0.63 and the pre-BBA amount, exceeds (II) the product of 0.60 and the PPS amount; or

                (iv) less than 70 percent of the pre-BBA amount, the amount of payment under this subsection shall be increased by 21 percent of the pre-BBA amount.
