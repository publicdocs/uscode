## § 1396e–1. Premium assistance

    (a) __In general__ 

        A State may elect to offer a premium assistance subsidy (as defined in subsection (c)) for qualified employer-sponsored coverage (as defined in subsection (b)) to all individuals who are entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter (and, in the case of an individual under age 19, to the parent of such an individual) who have access to such coverage if the State meets the requirements of this section and the offering of such a subsidy is cost-effective, as defined for purposes of [section 1397ee(c)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397ee/c/3/A].

    (b) __Qualified employer-sponsored coverage__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to paragraph (2)), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The second closing parenthesis probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  in this paragraph, the term “qualified employer-sponsored coverage” means a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer—

            (A) that qualifies as creditable coverage as a group health plan under section 2701(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act;  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

            (B) for which the employer contribution toward any premium for such coverage is at least 40 percent; and

            (C) that is offered to all individuals in a manner that would be considered a nondiscriminatory eligibility classification for purposes of paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of section 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (but determined without regard to clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of such paragraph).

        (2) __Exception__ 

        Such term does not include coverage consisting of—

            (A) benefits provided under a health flexible spending arrangement (as defined in section 106(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); or

            (B) a high deductible health plan (as defined in section 223(c)(2) of such Code), without regard to whether the plan is purchased in conjunction with a health savings account (as defined under section 223(d) of such Code).

        (3) __Treatment as third party liability__ 

            The State shall treat the coverage provided under qualified employer-sponsored coverage as a third party liability under [section 1396a(a)(25) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/25].

    (c) __Premium assistance subsidy__ 

        In this section, the term “premium assistance subsidy” means the amount of the employee contribution for enrollment in the qualified employer-sponsored coverage by the individual or by the individual’s family. Premium assistance subsidies under this section shall be considered, for purposes of [section 1396b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a], to be a payment for medical assistance.

    (d) __Voluntary participation__ 

        (1) __Employers__ 

            Participation by an employer in a premium assistance subsidy offered by a State under this section shall be voluntary. An employer may notify a State that it elects to opt-out of being directly paid a premium assistance subsidy on behalf of an employee.

        (2) __Beneficiaries__ 

            No subsidy shall be provided to an individual under this section unless the individual (or the individual’s parent) voluntarily elects to receive such a subsidy. A State may not require such an election as a condition of receipt of medical assistance. A State may not require, as a condition of an individual (or the individual’s parent) being or remaining eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter, that the individual (or the individual’s parent) apply for enrollment in qualified employer-sponsored coverage under this section.

        (3) __Opt-out permitted for any month__ 

            A State shall establish a process for permitting an individual (or the parent of an individual) receiving a premium assistance subsidy to disenroll the individual from the qualified employer-sponsored coverage.

    (e) __Requirement to pay premiums and cost-sharing and provide supplemental coverage__ 

        In the case of the participation of an individual (or the individual’s parent) in a premium assistance subsidy under this section for qualified employer-sponsored coverage, the State shall provide for payment of all enrollee premiums for enrollment in such coverage and all deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations for items and services otherwise covered under the State plan under this subchapter (exceeding the amount otherwise permitted under section 1396o of this title or, if applicable, section 1396o–1 of this title). The fact that an individual (or a parent) elects to enroll in qualified employer-sponsored coverage under this section shall not change the individual’s (or parent’s) eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan, except insofar as [section 1396a(a)(25) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/25] provides that payments for such assistance shall first be made under such coverage.
