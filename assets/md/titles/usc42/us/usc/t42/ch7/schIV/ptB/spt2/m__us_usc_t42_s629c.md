## § 629c. Allotments to States

    (a) __Indian tribes or tribal consortia__ 

        From the amount reserved pursuant to [section 629f(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b/3] for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each Indian tribe with a plan approved under this subpart an amount that bears the same ratio to such reserved amount as the number of children in the Indian tribe bears to the total number of children in all Indian tribes with State plans so approved, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most current and reliable information available to the Secretary. If a consortium of Indian tribes submits a plan approved under this subpart, the Secretary shall allot to the consortium an amount equal to the sum of the allotments determined for each Indian tribe that is part of the consortium.

    (b) __Territories__ 

        From the amount described in [section 629f(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/a] for any fiscal year that remains after applying [section 629f(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b] for the fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each of the jurisdictions of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa an amount determined in the same manner as the allotment to each of such jurisdictions is determined under [section 623 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s623].

    (c) __Other States__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            From the amount described in [section 629f(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/a] for any fiscal year that remains after applying [section 629f(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b] and subsection (b) of this section for the fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State (other than an Indian tribe) which is not specified in subsection (b) of this section an amount equal to such remaining amount multiplied by the supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits percentage of the State for the fiscal year.

        (2) __Supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits percentage defined__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                As used in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term “supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits percentage” means, with respect to a State and a fiscal year, the average monthly number of children receiving supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits in the State for months in the 3 fiscal years referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, as determined from sample surveys made under [section 2025(c) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s2025/c], expressed as a percentage of the average monthly number of children receiving supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits in the States described in such paragraph (1) for months in such 3 fiscal years, as so determined.

            (B) __Fiscal years used in calculation__ 

                For purposes of the calculation pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use data for the 3 most recent fiscal years, preceding the fiscal year for which the State’s allotment is calculated under this subsection, for which such data are available to the Secretary.

    (d) __Reallotments__ 

        The amount of any allotment to a State under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section for any fiscal year that the State certifies to the Secretary will not be required for carrying out the State plan under [section 629b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629b] shall be available for reallotment using the allotment methodology specified in subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section. Any amount so reallotted to a State is deemed part of the allotment of the State under the preceding provisions of this section.

    (e) __Allotment of funds reserved to support monthly caseworker visits__ 

        (1) __Territories__ 

            From the amount reserved pursuant to [section 629f(b)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b/4/A] for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each jurisdiction specified in subsection (b) of this section, that has provided to the Secretary such documentation as may be necessary to verify that the jurisdiction has complied with [section 629f(b)(4)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b/4/B/ii] during the fiscal year, an amount determined in the same manner as the allotment to each of such jurisdictions is determined under [section 623 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s623] (without regard to the initial allotment of $70,000 to each State).

        (2) __Other States__ 

            From the amount reserved pursuant to [section 629f(b)(4)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b/4/A] for any fiscal year that remains after applying paragraph (1) of this subsection for the fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State (other than an Indian tribe) not specified in subsection (b) of this section, that has provided to the Secretary such documentation as may be necessary to verify that the State has complied with [section 629f(b)(4)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s629f/b/4/B/ii] during the fiscal year, an amount equal to such remaining amount multiplied by the supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits percentage of the State (as defined in subsection (c)(2) of this section) for the fiscal year, except that in applying subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section, “subsection (e)(2)” shall be substituted for “such paragraph (1)”.
