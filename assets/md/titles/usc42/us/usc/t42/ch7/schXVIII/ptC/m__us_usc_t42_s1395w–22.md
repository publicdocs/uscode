## § 1395w–22. Benefits and beneficiary protections

    (a) __Basic benefits__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in [section 1395w–28(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–28/b/3] for MSA plans and except as provided in paragraph (6) for MA regional plans, each Medicare+Choice plan shall provide to members enrolled under this part, through providers and other persons that meet the applicable requirements of this subchapter and part A of subchapter XI of this chapter, benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option (and, for plan years before 2006, additional benefits required under [section 1395w–24(f)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–24/f/1/A]).

            (B) __Benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option defined__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    For purposes of this part, the term “benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option” means those items and services (other than hospice care) for which benefits are available under parts A and B to individuals entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B, with cost-sharing for those services as required under parts A and B or, subject to clause (iii), an actuarially equivalent level of cost-sharing as determined in this part.

                (ii) __Special rule for regional plans__ 

                    In the case of an MA regional plan in determining an actuarially equivalent level of cost-sharing with respect to benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option, there shall only be taken into account, with respect to the application of [section 1395w–27a(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27a/b/2], such expenses only with respect to subparagraph (A) of such section.

                (iii) __Limitation on variation of cost sharing for certain benefits__ 

                    Subject to clause (v), cost-sharing for services described in clause (iv) shall not exceed the cost-sharing required for those services under parts A and B.

                (iv) __Services described__ 

                The following services are described in this clause:

                    (I) Chemotherapy administration services.

                    (II) Renal dialysis services (as defined in [section 1395rr(b)(14)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395rr/b/14/B]).

                    (III) Skilled nursing care.

                    (IV) Such other services that the Secretary determines appropriate (including services that the Secretary determines require a high level of predictability and transparency for beneficiaries).

                (v) __Exception__ 

                    In the case of services described in clause (iv) for which there is no cost-sharing required under parts A and B, cost-sharing may be required for those services in accordance with clause (i).

        (2) __Satisfaction of requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            A Medicare+Choice plan (other than an MSA plan) offered by a Medicare+Choice organization satisfies paragraph (1)(A), with respect to benefits for items and services furnished other than through a provider or other person that has a contract with the organization offering the plan, if the plan provides payment in an amount so that—

                (i) the sum of such payment amount and any cost sharing provided for under the plan, is equal to at least

                (ii) the total dollar amount of payment for such items and services as would otherwise be authorized under parts A and B of this subchapter (including any balance billing permitted under such parts).

            (B) __Reference to related provisions__ 

            For provision relating to—

                (i) limitations on balance billing against Medicare+Choice organizations for non-contract providers, see subsection (k) of this section and [section 1395cc(a)(1)(O) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395cc/a/1/O], and

                (ii) limiting actuarial value of enrollee liability for covered benefits, see [section 1395w–24(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–24/e].

            (C) __Election of uniform coverage determination__ 

                In the case of a Medicare+Choice organization that offers a Medicare+Choice plan in an area in which more than one local coverage determination is applied with respect to different parts of the area, the organization may elect to have the local coverage determination for the part of the area that is most beneficial to Medicare+Choice enrollees (as identified by the Secretary) apply with respect to all Medicare+Choice enrollees enrolled in the plan.

        (3) __Supplemental benefits__ 

            (A) __Benefits included subject to Secretary’s approval__ 

                Each Medicare+Choice organization may provide to individuals enrolled under this part, other than under an MSA plan (without affording those individuals an option to decline the coverage), supplemental health care benefits that the Secretary may approve. The Secretary shall approve any such supplemental benefits unless the Secretary determines that including such supplemental benefits would substantially discourage enrollment by Medicare+Choice eligible individuals with the organization.

            (B) __At enrollees’ option__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), a Medicare+Choice organization may provide to individuals enrolled under this part supplemental health care benefits that the individuals may elect, at their option, to have covered.

                (ii) __Special rule for MSA plans__ 

                    A Medicare+Choice organization may not provide, under an MSA plan, supplemental health care benefits that cover the deductible described in [section 1395w–28(b)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–28/b/2/B]. In applying the previous sentence, health benefits described in [section 1395ss(u)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395ss/u/2/B] shall not be treated as covering such deductible.

            (C) __Application to Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan from offering supplemental benefits that include payment for some or all of the balance billing amounts permitted consistent with subsection (k) of this section and coverage of additional services that the plan finds to be medically necessary. Such benefits may include reductions in cost-sharing below the actuarial value specified in [section 1395w–24(e)(4)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–24/e/4/B].

        (4) __Organization as secondary payer__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Medicare+Choice organization may (in the case of the provision of items and services to an individual under a Medicare+Choice plan under circumstances in which payment under this subchapter is made secondary pursuant to [section 1395y(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395y/b/2]) charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under a law, plan, or policy described in such section—

            (A) the insurance carrier, employer, or other entity which under such law, plan, or policy is to pay for the provision of such services, or

            (B) such individual to the extent that the individual has been paid under such law, plan, or policy for such services.

        (5) __National coverage determinations and legislative changes in benefits__ 

        If there is a national coverage determination or legislative change in benefits required to be provided under this part made in the period beginning on the date of an announcement under [section 1395w–23(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23/b] and ending on the date of the next announcement under such section and the Secretary projects that the determination will result in a significant change in the costs to a Medicare+Choice organization of providing the benefits that are the subject of such national coverage determination and that such change in costs was not incorporated in the determination of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] included in the announcement made at the beginning of such period, then, unless otherwise required by law—

            (A) such determination or legislative change in benefits shall not apply to contracts under this part until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period, and

            (B) if such coverage determination or legislative change provides for coverage of additional benefits or coverage under additional circumstances, [section 1395w–21(i)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/i/1] shall not apply to payment for such additional benefits or benefits provided under such additional circumstances until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period.

            The projection under the previous sentence shall be based on an analysis by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the actuarial costs associated with the coverage determination or legislative change in benefits.

        (6) __Special benefit rules for regional plans__ 

            In the case of an MA plan that is an MA regional plan, benefits under the plan shall include the benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [section 1395w–27a(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–27a/b].

        (7) __Limitation on cost-sharing for dual eligibles and qualified medicare beneficiaries__ 

            In the case of an individual who is a full-benefit dual eligible individual (as defined in [section 1396u–5(c)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–5/c/6]) or a qualified medicare beneficiary (as defined in [section 1396d(p)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/p/1]) and who is enrolled in a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for special needs individuals described in [section 1395w–28(b)(6)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–28/b/6/B/ii], the plan may not impose cost-sharing that exceeds the amount of cost-sharing that would be permitted with respect to the individual under subchapter XIX if the individual were not enrolled in such plan.

    (b) __Antidiscrimination__ 

        (1) __Beneficiaries__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A Medicare+Choice organization may not deny, limit, or condition the coverage or provision of benefits under this part, for individuals permitted to be enrolled with the organization under this part, based on any health status-related factor described in section 2702(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  The Secretary shall not approve a plan of an organization if the Secretary determines that the design of the plan and its benefits are likely to substantially discourage enrollment by certain MA eligible individuals with the organization.

            (B) __Construction__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as requiring a Medicare+Choice organization to enroll individuals who are determined to have end-stage renal disease, except as provided under [section 1395w–21(a)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/a/3/B].

        (2) __Providers__ 

            A Medicare+Choice organization shall not discriminate with respect to participation, reimbursement, or indemnification as to any provider who is acting within the scope of the provider’s license or certification under applicable State law, solely on the basis of such license or certification. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a plan from including providers only to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the plan’s enrollees or from establishing any measure designed to maintain quality and control costs consistent with the responsibilities of the plan.

    (c) __Disclosure requirements__ 

        (1) __Detailed description of plan provisions__

        (3) __“Emergency services” defined__ 

        In this subsection—

            The term “emergency medical condition” means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in—

                (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or

                (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

        (4) __Assuring access to services in Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans__

        (6) __Requirement of all employer Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans to use contracts with providers__

    (e) __Quality improvement program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each MA organization shall have an ongoing quality improvement program for the purpose of improving the quality of care provided to enrollees in each MA plan offered by such organization.

                    In addition to the data required to be collected, analyzed, and reported under clause (i) and notwithstanding the limitations under subparagraph (B), as part of the quality improvement program under paragraph (1), each MA organization offering a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for special needs individuals shall provide for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data that permits the measurement of health outcomes and other indices of quality with respect to the requirements described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (f). Such data may be based on claims data and shall be at the plan level.

                (iii) __Application to local preferred provider organizations and MA regional plans__ 

                    Clause (i) shall apply to MA organizations with respect to MA local plans that are preferred provider organization plans and to MA regional plans only insofar as services are furnished by providers or services, physicians, and other health care practitioners and suppliers that have contracts with such organization to furnish services under such plans.

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall provide that a Medicare+Choice organization is deemed to meet all the requirements described in any specific clause of subparagraph (B) if the organization is accredited (and periodically reaccredited) by a private accrediting organization under a process that the Secretary has determined assures that the accrediting organization applies and enforces standards that meet or exceed the standards established under [section 1395w–26 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–26] to carry out the requirements in such clause.

            (A) __Receipt of requests__

                (ii) __Expedition required for physician requests__ 

                    In the case of a request for an expedited determination or reconsideration made under subparagraph (A)(ii), the organization shall expedite the determination or reconsideration if the request indicates that the application of the normal time frame for making a determination (or a reconsideration involving a determination) could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee’s ability to regain maximum function.

            An enrollee with a Medicare+Choice plan of a Medicare+Choice organization under this part who is dissatisfied by reason of the enrollee’s failure to receive any health service to which the enrollee believes the enrollee is entitled and at no greater charge than the enrollee believes the enrollee is required to pay is entitled, if the amount in controversy is $100 or more, to a hearing before the Secretary to the same extent as is provided in [section 405(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s405/b], and in any such hearing the Secretary shall make the organization a party.

        (1) __Procedures__ 

        Insofar as a Medicare+Choice organization offers benefits under a Medicare+Choice plan through agreements with physicians, the organization shall establish reasonable procedures relating to the participation (under an agreement between a physician and the organization) of physicians under such a plan.

            (A) providing notice of the rules regarding participation,

            (B) __Conscience protection__ 

            Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as requiring a Medicare+Choice plan to provide, reimburse for, or provide coverage of a counseling or referral service if the Medicare+ÐChoice organization offering the plan—

                (i) objects to the provision of such service on moral or religious grounds; and

                (ii) in the manner and through the written instrumentalities such Medicare+ÐChoice organization deems appropriate, makes available information on its policies regarding such service to prospective enrollees before or during enrollment and to enrollees within 90 days after the date that the organization or plan adopts a change in policy regarding such a counseling or referral service.

            (C) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in subparagraph (B) shall be construed to affect disclosure requirements under State law or under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \[[29 U.S.C. 1001][/us/usc/t29/s1001] et seq.\].

                (i) No specific payment is made directly or indirectly under the plan to a physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided with respect to a specific individual enrolled with the organization.

                (ii) If the plan places a physician or physician group at substantial financial risk (as determined by the Secretary) for services not provided by the physician or physician group, the organization provides stop-loss protection for the physician or group that is adequate and appropriate, based on standards developed by the Secretary that take into account the number of physicians placed at such substantial financial risk in the group or under the plan and the number of individuals enrolled with the organization who receive services from the physician or group.

            (B) __“Physician incentive plan” defined__ 

                In this paragraph, the term “physician incentive plan” means any compensation arrangement between a Medicare+Choice organization and a physician or physician group that may directly or indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services provided with respect to individuals enrolled with the organization under this part.

        (6) __Special rules for Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans__

            (A) the provider, professional, or other entity furnishes services that are covered under the plan to such an enrollee; and

            (B)

             before providing such services, the provider, professional, or other entity—

                (i) has been informed of the individual’s enrollment under the plan, and

                (ii)

                 either—

                    (I) has been informed of the terms and conditions of payment for such services under the plan, or

                    (II) is given a reasonable opportunity to obtain information concerning such terms and conditions,

                 in a manner reasonably designed to effect informed agreement by a provider.

            (A) __In general__

                (iii) reductions in adverse drug interactions; and

                (iv) efficiencies in filing prescriptions through reduced administrative costs.

            (C) __Structure__ 

                Additional or increased payments under this subsection may be structured in the same manner as medication therapy management fees are structured under section 1395w–104(c)(2)(E) 1 of this title.

Any penalty or other provision of law that applies to such a payment with respect to an individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter (but not enrolled with a Medicare+Choice organization under this part) also applies with respect to an individual so enrolled.

                    (I) notice of the fact that balance billing is permitted under such subparagraph for such services, and

                    (II) a good faith estimate of the likely amount of such balance billing (if any), with respect to such services, based upon the presenting condition of the enrollee.
