                (ii) additional safe harbors specifying payment practices that shall not be treated as a criminal offense under [section 1320a–7b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7b/b] and shall not serve as the basis for an exclusion under [section 1320a–7(b)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7/b/7];
