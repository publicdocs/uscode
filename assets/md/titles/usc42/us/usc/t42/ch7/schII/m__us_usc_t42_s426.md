    (b) __Individuals under 65 years__ 

    Every individual who—

        (1) has not attained age 65, and

        (2)

            (A) is entitled to, and has for 24 calendar months been entitled to, (i) disability insurance benefits under [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423] or (ii) child’s insurance benefits under [section 402(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/d] by reason of a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]) or (iii) widow’s insurance benefits under [section 402(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/e] or widower’s insurance benefits under [section 402(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/f] by reason of a disability (as defined in [section 423(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/d]), or

                (i) has filed an application, in conformity with regulations of the Secretary, for hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter pursuant to this subparagraph, and

                (ii)

                 would meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) (as determined under the disability criteria, including reviews, applied under this subchapter), including the requirement that he has been entitled to the specified benefits for 24 months, if—

                    (I) medicare qualified government employment (as defined in [section 410(p) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/p]) were treated as employment (as defined in [section 410(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s410/a]) for purposes of this subchapter, and

        shall be entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter for each month beginning with the later of (I) July 1973 or (II) the twenty-fifth month of his entitlement or status as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary described in paragraph (2), and ending (subject to the last sentence of this subsection) with the month following the month in which notice of termination of such entitlement to benefits or status as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary described in paragraph (2) is mailed to him, or if earlier, with the month before the month in which he attains age 65. In applying the previous sentence in the case of an individual described in paragraph (2)(C), the “twenty-fifth month of his entitlement” refers to the first month after the twenty-fourth month of entitlement to specified benefits referred to in paragraph (2)(C) and “notice of termination of such entitlement” refers to a notice that the individual would no longer be determined to be entitled to such specified benefits under the conditions described in that paragraph.

In determining when an individual’s entitlement or status terminates for purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “36 months” in the second sentence of [section 423(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423/a/1], in [section 402(d)(1)(G)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/d/1/G/i], in the last sentence of [section 402(e)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/e/1], and in the last sentence of [section 402(f)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402/f/1] shall be applied as though it read “15 months”.

    (c) __Conditions__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a) of this section—

        (1) entitlement of an individual to hospital insurance benefits for a month shall consist of entitlement to have payment made under, and subject to the limitations in, part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter on his behalf for inpatient hospital services, post-hospital extended care services, and home health services (as such terms are defined in part E of subchapter XVIII of this chapter) furnished him in the United States (or outside the United States in the case of inpatient hospital services furnished under the conditions described in [section 1395f(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395f/f]) during such month; except that (A) no such payment may be made for post-hospital extended care services furnished before January 1967, and (B) no such payment may be made for post-hospital extended care services unless the discharge from the hospital required to qualify such services for payment under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter occurred (i) after June 30, 1966, or on or after the first day of the month in which he attains age 65, whichever is later, or (ii) if he was entitled to hospital insurance benefits pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, at a time when he was so entitled; and

        (2) an individual shall be deemed entitled to monthly insurance benefits under section 402 or [section 423 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s423], or to be a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary, for the month in which he died if he would have been entitled to such benefits, or would have been a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary, for such month had he died in the next month.

    (d) __“Qualified railroad retirement beneficiary” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified railroad retirement beneficiary” means an individual whose name has been certified to the Secretary by the Railroad Retirement Board under [section 231f(d) of title 45][/us/usc/t45/s231f/d]. An individual shall cease to be a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary at the close of the month preceding the month which is certified by the Railroad Retirement Board as the month in which he ceased to meet the requirements of [section 231f(d) of title 45][/us/usc/t45/s231f/d].

        (2) For purposes of determining entitlement to hospital insurance benefits under subsection (b) of this section in the case of an individual under age 65 who is entitled to benefits under [section 402 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s402], and who was entitled to widow’s insurance benefits or widower’s insurance benefits based on disability for the month before the first month in which such individual was so entitled to old-age insurance benefits (but ceased to be entitled to such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits upon becoming entitled to such old-age insurance benefits), such individual shall be deemed to have continued to be entitled to such widow’s insurance benefits or widower’s insurance benefits for and after such first month.

        (3) For purposes of determining entitlement to hospital insurance benefits under subsection (b) of this section, any disabled widow aged 50 or older who is entitled to mother’s insurance benefits (and who would have been entitled to widow’s insurance benefits by reason of disability if she had filed for such widow’s benefits), and any disabled widower aged 50 or older who is entitled to father’s insurance benefits (and who would have been entitled to widower’s insurance benefits by reason of disability if he had filed for such widower’s benefits), shall, upon application for such hospital insurance benefits be deemed to have filed for such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits.

    (f) __Medicare waiting period for recipients of disability benefits__ 

    For purposes of subsection (b) of this section (and for purposes of [section 1395p(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395p/g/1] and [section 231f(d)(2)(ii) of title 45][/us/usc/t45/s231f/d/2/ii]), the 24 months for which an individual has to have been entitled to specified monthly benefits on the basis of disability in order to become entitled to hospital insurance benefits on such basis effective with any particular month (or to be deemed to have enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance program, on the basis of such entitlement, by reason of [section 1395p(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395p/f]), where such individual had been entitled to specified monthly benefits of the same type during a previous period which terminated—
