        (2) __Procedures__ 

            The provisions of [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a] (other than subsections (a) and (b) and the second sentence of subsection (f)) shall apply to the imposition of a civil money penalty under this subsection in the same manner as such provisions apply to the imposition of a penalty under such [section 1320a–7a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a].

        (3) __Tiers of penalties described__

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Extension of period__ 

                (i) __No penalty__ 

                    With respect to the imposition of a penalty by the Secretary under subsection (a), the period referred to in subparagraph (A) may be extended as determined appropriate by the Secretary based on the nature and extent of the failure to comply.

                (ii) __Assistance__ 

                    If the Secretary determines that a person failed to comply because the person was unable to comply, the Secretary may provide technical assistance to the person during the period described in subparagraph (A). Such assistance shall be provided in any manner determined appropriate by the Secretary.

        (3) __Reduction__ 

            In the case of a failure to comply which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, any penalty under subsection (a) and any damages under subsection (d) that is  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “are”. </sup></sup>  not entirely waived under paragraph (3)  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be “(2)”. </sup></sup>  may be waived to the extent that the payment of such penalty  <sup>\[4\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 4 So in original.

            (B) __Limitation__

                In assessing damages under subparagraph (A), the court may consider the factors the Secretary may consider in determining the amount of a civil money penalty under subsection (a) under the HIPAA privacy regulations.

        (3) __Attorney fees__ 

            In the case of any successful action under paragraph (1), the court, in its discretion, may award the costs of the action and reasonable attorney fees to the State.

        (4) __Notice to Secretary__ 

        The State shall serve prior written notice of any action under paragraph (1) upon the Secretary and provide the Secretary with a copy of its complaint, except in any case in which such prior notice is not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice immediately upon instituting such action. The Secretary shall have the right—

            (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising therein; and

            (C) to file petitions for appeal.

        (5) __Construction__

        (7) __Limitation on State action while Federal action is pending__

        (8) __Application of CMP statute of limitation__ 

            A civil action may not be instituted with respect to a violation of this part unless an action to impose a civil money penalty may be instituted under subsection (a) with respect to such violation consistent with the second sentence of [section 1320a–7a(c)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7a/c/1].

    (e) __Allowing continued use of corrective action__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services from continuing, in its discretion, to use corrective action without a penalty in cases where the person did not know (and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known) of the violation involved.
