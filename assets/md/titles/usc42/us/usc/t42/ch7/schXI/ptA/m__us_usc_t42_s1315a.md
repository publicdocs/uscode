            (B) __Applicable subchapter__ 

                The term “applicable subchapter” means subchapter XVIII, subchapter XIX, or both.

        (5) __Testing within certain geographic areas__ 

            For purposes of testing payment and service delivery models under this section, the Secretary may elect to limit testing of a model to certain geographic areas.

    (b) __Testing of models (phase I)__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The CMI shall test payment and service delivery models in accordance with selection criteria under paragraph (2) to determine the effect of applying such models under the applicable subchapter (as defined in subsection (a)(4)(B)) on program expenditures under such subchapters and the quality of care received by individuals receiving benefits under such subchapter.

        (2) __Selection of models to be tested__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall select models to be tested from models where the Secretary determines that there is evidence that the model addresses a defined population for which there are deficits in care leading to poor clinical outcomes or potentially avoidable expenditures. The Secretary shall focus on models expected to reduce program costs under the applicable subchapter while preserving or enhancing the quality of care received by individuals receiving benefits under such subchapter. The models selected under this subparagraph may include, but are not limited to, the models described in subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Opportunities__ 

            The models described in this subparagraph are the following models:

                (i) Promoting broad payment and practice reform in primary care, including patient-centered medical home models for high-need applicable individuals, medical homes that address women’s unique health care needs, and models that transition primary care practices away from fee-for-service based reimbursement and toward comprehensive payment or salary-based payment.
