            (C) __Substantial actuarial value for additional services included in benchmark package__ 

                With respect to each of the categories of additional services described in subsection (c)(2) of this section for which coverage is provided under the benchmark benefit package used under subparagraph (B), the coverage has an actuarial value that is equal to at least 75 percent of the actuarial value of the coverage of that category of services in such package.

        (3) __Existing comprehensive State-based coverage__ 

            Health benefits coverage under an existing comprehensive State-based program, described in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

        (4) __Secretary-approved coverage__ 

            Any other health benefits coverage that the Secretary determines, upon application by a State, provides appropriate coverage for the population of targeted low-income children proposed to be provided such coverage.

    (b) __Benchmark benefit packages__

        (4) __Determination of actuarial value__ 

        The actuarial value of coverage of benchmark benefit packages, coverage offered under the State child health plan, and coverage of any categories of additional services under benchmark benefit packages and under coverage offered by such a plan, shall be set forth in an actuarial opinion in an actuarial report that has been prepared—

            (A) by an individual who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries;

            (B) using generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies;

            (C) using a standardized set of utilization and price factors;

            (D) using a standardized population that is representative of privately insured children of the age of children who are expected to be covered under the State child health plan;

            (E) applying the same principles and factors in comparing the value of different coverage (or categories of services);

            (F) without taking into account any differences in coverage based on the method of delivery or means of cost control or utilization used; and

            (G) taking into account the ability of a State to reduce benefits by taking into account the increase in actuarial value of benefits coverage offered under the State child health plan that results from the limitations on cost sharing under such coverage.

                (ii) __State employee dependent dental coverage__ 

                    A dental benefits plan that is offered and generally available to State employees in the State involved and that has been selected most frequently by employees seeking dependent coverage, among such plans that provide such dependent coverage, in either of the previous 2 plan years.

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a State child health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, such plan shall ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits comply with the requirements of section 2705(a) of the Public Health Service Act  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  in the same manner as such requirements apply to a group health plan.

            (B) __Deemed compliance__

        (7) __Construction on prohibited coverage__

        (8) __Availability of coverage for items and services furnished through school-based health centers__ 

            Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting a State’s ability to provide child health assistance for covered items and services that are furnished through school-based health centers (as defined in [section 1397jj(c)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397jj/c/9]).

            (D) was offered as of August 5, 1997.

        (2) __Modifications__ 

        A State may modify a program described in paragraph (1) from time to time so long as it continues to meet the requirement of subparagraph (A) and does not reduce the actuarial value of the coverage under the program below the lower of—

            (B) __Protection for lower income children__ 

                The State child health plan may only vary premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost sharing based on the family income of targeted low-income children in a manner that does not favor children from families with higher income over children from families with lower income.

        (2) __No cost sharing on benefits for preventive services or pregnancy-related assistance__ 

            The State child health plan may not impose deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost sharing with respect to benefits for services within the category of services described in subsection (c)(1)(D) of this section or for pregnancy-related assistance.

        (3) __Limitations on premiums and cost-sharing__ 

            (A) __Children in families with income below 150 percent of poverty line__ 

            In the case of a targeted low-income child whose family income is at or below 150 percent of the poverty line, the State child health plan may not impose—

            (B) __Other children__ 

                For children not described in subparagraph (A), subject to paragraphs (1)(B) and (2), any premiums, deductibles, cost sharing or similar charges imposed under the State child health plan may be imposed on a sliding scale related to income, except that the total annual aggregate cost-sharing with respect to all targeted low-income children in a family under this subchapter may not exceed 5 percent of such family’s income for the year involved.

            (C) __Premium grace period__ 

            The State child health plan—

                (i) shall afford individuals enrolled under the plan a grace period of at least 30 days from the beginning of a new coverage period to make premium payments before the individual’s coverage under the plan may be terminated; and

                (ii)

                 shall provide to such an individual, not later than 7 days after the first day of such grace period, notice—

                    (I) that failure to make a premium payment within the grace period will result in termination of coverage under the State child health plan; and

                    (II) of the individual’s right to challenge the proposed termination pursuant to the applicable Federal regulations.

                For purposes of clause (i), the term “new coverage period” means the month immediately following the last month for which the premium has been paid.

        (4) __Relation to medicaid requirements__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting the rules relating to the use of enrollment fees, premiums, deductions, cost sharing, and similar charges in the case of targeted low-income children who are provided child health assistance in the form of coverage under a medicaid program under [section 1397aa(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1397aa/a/2].

                If the State child health plan provides for benefits through payment for, or a contract with, a group health plan or group health insurance coverage, the plan may permit the imposition of a preexisting condition exclusion but only insofar as it is permitted under the applicable provisions of part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \[[29 U.S.C. 1181][/us/usc/t29/s1181] et seq.\] and title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act \[[42 U.S.C. 300gg][/us/usc/t42/s300gg] et seq.\].

        (2) __Compliance with other requirements__ 

            Coverage offered under this section shall comply with the requirements of subpart 2 of part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act 1 insofar as such requirements apply with respect to a health insurance issuer that offers group health insurance coverage.
