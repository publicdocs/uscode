                (ii) __Effective period__ 

                    Determinations under this subparagraph shall be effective beginning with the month in which the individual applies for a determination that the individual is a subsidy eligible individual and shall remain in effect for a period specified by the Secretary, but not to exceed 1 year.

            For purposes of applying this section—

                (i) in the case of a part D eligible individual who is not treated as a subsidy eligible individual under subparagraph (B)(v), income shall be determined in the manner described in [section 1396d(p)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/p/1/B], without regard to the application of [section 1396a(r)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/r/2] and except that support and maintenance furnished in kind shall not be counted as income; and

                (ii) the term “poverty line” has the meaning given such term in [section 9902(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9902/2], including any revision required by such section.

                Any resource limitation established under clause (ii) that is not a multiple of $10 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.

            (E) __Alternative resource standard__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The resources requirement of this subparagraph is that an individual’s resources (as determined under [section 1382b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1382b] for purposes of the supplemental security income program subject to the life insurance policy exclusion provided under subparagraph (G)) do not exceed—

                (iv) __Methodology flexibility__ 

                    The Secretary may permit a State in making eligibility determinations for premium and cost-sharing subsidies under this section to use the same asset or resource methodologies that are used with respect to eligibility for medical assistance for medicare cost-sharing described in [section 1396d(p) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/p] so long as the Secretary determines that the use of such methodologies will not result in any significant differences in the number of individuals determined to be subsidy eligible individuals.

            (F) __Treatment of territorial residents__ 

                In the case of a part D eligible individual who is not a resident of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, the individual is not eligible to be a subsidy eligible individual under this section but may be eligible for financial assistance with prescription drug expenses under [section 1396u–5(e) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–5/e].

            (G) __Life insurance policy exclusion__

                Any amount established under clause (i) or (ii), that is based on an increase of $1 or $3, that is not a multiple of 5 cents or 10 cents, respectively, shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 cents or 10 cents, respectively.

            (B) __Reduced deductible__ 

            The dollar amount applied under paragraph (2)(B)—

                (ii) for a subsequent year shall be the dollar amount specified in this clause (or clause (i)) for the previous year increased by the annual percentage increase described in [section 1395w–102(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–102/b/6] for the year involved.

                Any amount established under clause (i) or (ii) that is not a multiple of $1 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.

        (5) __Waiver of de minimis premiums__ 

            The Secretary shall, under procedures established by the Secretary, permit a prescription drug plan or an MA–PD plan to waive the monthly beneficiary premium for a subsidy eligible individual if the amount of such premium is de minimis.

        (1) __In general__ 

            The premium subsidy amount described in this subsection for a subsidy eligible individual residing in a PDP region and enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA–PD plan is the low-income benchmark premium amount (as defined in paragraph (2)) for the PDP region in which the individual resides or, if greater, the amount specified in paragraph (3).

        (2) __Low-income benchmark premium amount defined__

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “low-income benchmark premium amount” means, with respect to a PDP region in which—

            (B) __Premium amounts described__ 

            The premium amounts described in this subparagraph are, in the case of—

                (i) a prescription drug plan that is a basic prescription drug plan, the monthly beneficiary premium for such plan;

                (ii) a prescription drug plan that provides alternative prescription drug coverage the actuarial value of which is greater than that of standard prescription drug coverage, the portion of the monthly beneficiary premium that is attributable to basic prescription drug coverage; and

                (iii) an MA–PD plan, the portion of the MA monthly prescription drug beneficiary premium that is attributable to basic prescription drug benefits (described in section 1395w–22(a)(6)(B)(ii)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. [Section 1395w–22(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/a/6] does not contain a subpar.

                The premium amounts described in this subparagraph do not include any amounts attributable to late enrollment penalties under [section 1395w–113(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–113/b].

        (3) __Access to 0 premium plan__ 

            In no case shall the premium subsidy amount under this subsection for a PDP region be less than the lowest monthly beneficiary premium for a prescription drug plan that offers basic prescription drug coverage in the region.

    (c) __Administration of subsidy program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall provide a process whereby, in the case of a part D eligible individual who is determined to be a subsidy eligible individual and who is enrolled in a prescription drug plan or is enrolled in an MA–PD plan—

            (A) the Secretary provides for a notification of the PDP sponsor or the MA organization offering the plan involved that the individual is eligible for a subsidy and the amount of the subsidy under subsection (a) of this section;

            (B) the sponsor or organization involved reduces the premiums or cost-sharing otherwise imposed by the amount of the applicable subsidy and submits to the Secretary information on the amount of such reduction;

            (C) the Secretary periodically and on a timely basis reimburses the sponsor or organization for the amount of such reductions; and

            (D) the Secretary ensures the confidentiality of individually identifiable information.

            In applying subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall compute reductions based upon imposition under subsections (a)(1)(D) and (a)(2)(E) of this section of unreduced copayment amounts applied under such subsections.

        (2) __Use of capitated form of payment__ 

            The reimbursement under this section with respect to cost-sharing subsidies may be computed on a capitated basis, taking into account the actuarial value of the subsidies and with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences in the risks actually involved.

    (d) __Facilitation of reassignments__ 

    Beginning not later than January 1, 2011, the Secretary shall, in the case of a subsidy eligible individual who is enrolled in one prescription drug plan and is subsequently reassigned by the Secretary to a new prescription drug plan, provide the individual, within 30 days of such reassignment, with—

        (1) information on formulary differences between the individual’s former plan and the plan to which the individual is reassigned with respect to the individual’s drug regimens; and
