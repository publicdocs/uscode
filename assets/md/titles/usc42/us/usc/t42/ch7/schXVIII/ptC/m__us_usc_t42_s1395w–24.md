        (2) __For supplemental benefits before 2006__ 

            For periods before 2006, if the Medicare+Choice organization provides to its members enrolled under this part in a Medicare+Choice plan described in [section 1395w–21(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/a/2/A] with respect to supplemental benefits described in [section 1395w–22(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/a/3], the sum of the Medicare+Choice monthly supplemental beneficiary premium (multiplied by 12) charged and the actuarial value of its deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments charged with respect to such benefits may not exceed the adjusted community rate for such benefits (as defined in subsection (f)(3) of this section).

        (3) __Determination on other basis__ 

            If the Secretary determines that adequate data are not available to determine the actuarial value under paragraph (1)(A), (2), or (4), the Secretary may determine such amount with respect to all individuals in same geographic area, the State, or in the United States, eligible to enroll in the Medicare+Choice plan involved under this part or on the basis of other appropriate data.

        (4) __Special rule for private fee-for-service plans and for basic benefits beginning in 2006__ 

        With respect to a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan (other than a plan that is an MSA plan) and for periods beginning with 2006, with respect to an MA plan described in [section 1395w–21(a)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/a/2/A], in no event may—

    (f) __Requirement for additional benefits before 2006__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For years before 2006, each Medicare+Choice organization (in relation to a Medicare+Choice plan, other than an MSA plan, it offers) shall provide that if there is an excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for the plan for a contract year, subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the organization shall provide to individuals such additional benefits (as the organization may specify) in a value which the Secretary determines is at least equal to the adjusted excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (C)).

            (B) __Excess amount__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the “excess amount”, for an organization for a plan, is the amount (if any) by which—

                (i) the average of the capitation payments made to the organization under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] for the plan at the beginning of contract year, exceeds

                (ii) the actuarial value of the required benefits described in [section 1395w–22(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/a/1/A] under the plan for individuals under this part, as determined based upon an adjusted community rate described in paragraph (3) (as reduced for the actuarial value of the coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles under parts A and B of this subchapter).

            (C) __Adjusted excess amount__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the “adjusted excess amount”, for an organization for a plan, is the excess amount reduced to reflect any amount withheld and reserved for the organization for the year under paragraph (2).

            (D) __Uniform application__ 

                This paragraph shall be applied uniformly for all enrollees for a plan.

            (E) __Premium reductions__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), as part of providing any additional benefits required under subparagraph (A), a Medicare+Choice organization may elect a reduction in its payments under [section 1395w–23(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23/a/1/A] with respect to a Medicare+Choice plan and the Secretary shall apply such reduction to reduce the premium under [section 1395r of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395r] of each enrollee in such plan as provided in [section 1395s(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395s/i].

                (ii) __Amount of reduction__ 

                The amount of the reduction under clause (i) with respect to any enrollee in a Medicare+Choice plan—

                    (I) may not exceed 125 percent of the premium described under [section 1395r(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395r/a/3]; and

                    (II) shall apply uniformly to each enrollee of the Medicare+Choice plan to which such reduction applies.

            (F) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in [section 1395w–22(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/a/3]) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.

        (2) __Stabilization fund__ 

            A Medicare+Choice organization may provide that a part of the value of an excess amount described in paragraph (1) be withheld and reserved in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (in such proportions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) by the Secretary for subsequent annual contract periods, to the extent required to stabilize and prevent undue fluctuations in the additional benefits offered in those subsequent periods by the organization in accordance with such paragraph. Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.

        (3) __Adjusted community rate__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, subject to paragraph (4), the term “adjusted community rate” for a service or services means, at the election of a Medicare+Choice organization, either—

            (A) the rate of payment for that service or services which the Secretary annually determines would apply to an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under this part if the rate of payment were determined under a “community rating system” (as defined in [section 300e–1(8) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s300e–1/8], other than subparagraph (C)), or

            (B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services,

            but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).

        (4) __Determination based on insufficient data__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.

    (g) __Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes__ 

        No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under [section 1395w–23 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–23] or premiums paid to such organizations under this part.

    (h) __Permitting use of segments of service areas__ 

        The Secretary shall permit a Medicare+Choice organization to elect to apply the provisions of this section uniformly to separate segments of a service area (rather than uniformly to an entire service area) as long as such segments are composed of one or more Medicare+Choice payment areas.
