## § 1396r–6. Extension of eligibility for medical assistance

    (a) __Initial 6-month extension__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter but subject to subparagraph (B) and paragraph (5), each State plan approved under this subchapter must provide that each family which was receiving aid pursuant to a plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter in at least 3 of the 6 months immediately preceding the month in which such family becomes ineligible for such aid, because of hours of, or income from, employment of the caretaker relative (as defined in subsection (e) of this section) or because of section 602(a)(8)(B)(ii)(II)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title (providing for a time-limited earned income disregard), shall, subject to paragraph (3) and without any reapplication for benefits under the plan, remain eligible for assistance under the plan approved under this subchapter during the immediately succeeding 6-month period in accordance with this subsection.

            (B) __State option to waive requirement for 3 months before receipt of medical assistance__ 

                A State may, at its option, elect also to apply subparagraph (A) in the case of a family that was receiving such aid for fewer than three months or that had applied for and was eligible for such aid for fewer than 3 months during the 6 immediately preceding months described in such subparagraph.

        (2) __Notice of benefits__ 

        Each State, in the notice of termination of aid under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter sent to a family meeting the requirements of paragraph (1)—

            (A) shall notify the family of its right to extended medical assistance under this subsection and include in the notice a description of the reporting requirement of subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) of this section and of the circumstances (described in paragraph (3)) under which such extension may be terminated; and

            (B) shall include a card or other evidence of the family’s entitlement to assistance under this subchapter for the period provided in this subsection.

        (3) __Termination of extension__ 

            (A) __No dependent child__ 

                Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), extension of assistance during the 6-month period described in paragraph (1) to a family shall terminate (during such period) at the close of the first month in which the family ceases to include a child, whether or not the child is (or would if needy be) a dependent child under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

            (B) __Notice before termination__ 

                No termination of assistance shall become effective under subparagraph (A) until the State has provided the family with notice of the grounds for the termination.

            (C) __Continuation in certain cases until redetermination__ 

                With respect to a child who would cease to receive medical assistance because of subparagraph (A) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the child is described in clause (i) of [section 1396d(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a] or clause (i)(IV), (i)(VI), (i)(VII), or (ii)(IX) of [section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/A], the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the child is not eligible for assistance under the plan.

        (4) __Scope of coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), during the 6-month extension period under this subsection, the amount, duration, and scope of medical assistance made available with respect to a family shall be the same as if the family were still receiving aid under the plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

            (B) __State medicaid “wrap-around” option__ 

            A State, at its option, may pay a family’s expenses for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar costs for health insurance or other health coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative or by an employer of the absent parent of a dependent child. In the case of such coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative—

                (i)

                 the State may require the caretaker relative, as a condition of extension of coverage under this subsection for the caretaker and the caretaker’s family, to make application for such employer coverage, but only if—

                    (I) the caretaker relative is not required to make financial contributions for such coverage (whether through payroll deduction, payment of deductibles, coinsurance, or similar costs, or otherwise), and

                    (II) the State provides, directly or otherwise, for payment of any of the premium amount, deductible, coinsurance, or similar expense that the employee is otherwise required to pay; and

                (ii) the State shall treat the coverage under such an employer plan as a third party liability (under [section 1396a(a)(25) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/25]).

                Payments for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar expenses under this subparagraph shall be considered, for purposes of [section 1396b(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a], to be payments for medical assistance.

        (5) __Option of 12-month initial eligibility period__ 

            A State may elect to treat any reference in this subsection to a 6-month period (or 6 months) as a reference to a 12-month period (or 12 months). In the case of such an election, subsection (b) shall not apply.

    (b) __Additional 6-month extension__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter but subject to subsection (a)(5), each State plan approved under this subchapter shall provide that the State shall offer to each family, which has received assistance during the entire 6-month period under subsection (a) of this section and which meets the requirement of paragraph (2)(B)(i), in the last month of the period the option of extending coverage under this subsection for the succeeding 6-month period, subject to paragraph (3).

        (2) __Notice and reporting requirements__ 

            (A) __Notices__ 

                (i) __Notice during initial extension period of option and requirements__ 

                    Each State, during the 3rd and 6th month of any extended assistance furnished to a family under subsection (a) of this section, shall notify the family of the family’s option for additional extended assistance under this subsection. Each such notice shall include (I) in the 3rd month notice, a statement of the reporting requirement under subparagraph (B)(i), and, in the 6th month notice, a statement of the reporting requirement under subparagraph (B)(ii), (II) a statement as to whether any premiums are required for such additional extended assistance, and (III) a description of other out-of-pocket expenses, benefits, reporting and payment procedures, and any pre-existing condition limitations, waiting periods, or other coverage limitations imposed under any alternative coverage options offered under paragraph (4)(D). The 6th month notice under this subparagraph shall describe the amount of any premium required of a particular family for each of the first 3 months of additional extended assistance under this subsection.

                (ii) __Notice during additional extension period of reporting requirements and premiums__ 

                    Each State, during the 3rd month of any additional extended assistance furnished to a family under this subsection, shall notify the family of the reporting requirement under subparagraph (B)(ii) and a statement of the amount of any premium required for such extended assistance for the succeeding 3 months.

            (B) __Reporting requirements__ 

                (i) __During initial extension period__ 

                    Each State shall require (as a condition for additional extended assistance under this subsection) that a family receiving extended assistance under subsection (a) of this section report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 4th month in the period of extended assistance under subsection (a) of this section, on the family’s gross monthly earnings and on the family’s costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the first 3 months of that period. A State may permit such additional extended assistance under this subsection notwithstanding a failure to report under this clause if the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis.

                (ii) __During additional extension period__ 

                    Each State shall require that a family receiving extended assistance under this subsection report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 1st month and of the 4th month in the period of additional extended assistance under this subsection, on the family’s gross monthly earnings and on the family’s costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the 3 preceding months.

                (iii) __Clarification on frequency of reporting__ 

                    A State may not require that a family receiving extended assistance under this subsection or subsection (a) of this section report more frequently than as required under clause (i) or (ii).

        (3) __Termination of extension__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), extension of assistance during the 6-month period described in paragraph (1) to a family shall terminate (during the period) as follows:

                (i) __No dependent child__ 

                    The extension shall terminate at the close of the first month in which the family ceases to include a child, whether or not the child is (or would if needy be) a dependent child under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

                (ii) __Failure to pay any premium__ 

                    If the family fails to pay any premium for a month under paragraph (5) by the 21st day of the following month, the extension shall terminate at the close of that following month, unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to pay such premium on a timely basis.

                (iii) __Quarterly income reporting and test__ 

                The extension under this subsection shall terminate at the close of the 1st or 4th month of the 6-month period if—

                    (I) the family fails to report to the State, by the 21st day of such month, the information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis;

                    (II) the caretaker relative had no earnings in one or more of the previous 3 months, unless such lack of any earnings was due to an involuntary loss of employment, illness, or other good cause, established to the satisfaction of the State; or

                    (III) the State determines that the family’s average gross monthly earnings (less such costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative) during the immediately preceding 3-month period exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with [section 9902(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9902/2]) applicable to a family of the size involved.

                Information described in clause (iii)(I) shall be subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure of information provided under section 602(a)(9)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title. Instead of terminating a family’s extension under clause (iii)(I), a State, at its option, may provide for suspension of the extension until the month after the month in which the family reports information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), but only if the family’s extension has not otherwise been terminated under subclause (II) or (III) of clause (iii). The State shall make determinations under clause (iii)(III) for a family each time a report under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the family is received.

            (B) __Notice before termination__ 

                No termination of assistance shall become effective under subparagraph (A) until the State has provided the family with notice of the grounds for the termination, which notice shall include (in the case of termination under subparagraph (A)(iii)(II), relating to no continued earnings) a description of how the family may reestablish eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan. No such termination shall be effective earlier than 10 days after the date of mailing of such notice.

            (C) __Continuation in certain cases until redetermination__ 

                (i) __Dependent children__ 

                    With respect to a child who would cease to receive medical assistance because of subparagraph (A)(i) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the child is described in clause (i) of [section 1396d(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a] or clause (i)(IV), (i)(VI), (i)(VII), or (ii)(IX) of [section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/A], the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the child is not eligible for assistance under the plan.

                (ii) __Medically needy__ 

                    With respect to an individual who would cease to receive medical assistance because of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the individual is within a category of person for which medical assistance under the State plan is available under [section 1396a(a)(10)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396a/a/10/C] (relating to medically needy individuals), the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the individual is not eligible for assistance under the plan.

        (4) __Coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            During the extension period under this subsection—

                (i) the State plan shall offer to each family medical assistance which (subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C)) is the same amount, duration, and scope as would be made available to the family if it were still receiving aid under the plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter; and

                (ii) the State plan may offer alternative coverage described in subparagraph (D).

            (B) __Elimination of most non-acute care benefits__ 

                At a State’s option and notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, a State may choose not to provide medical assistance under this subsection with respect to any (or all) of the items and services described in paragraphs (4)(A), (6), (7), (8), (11), (13), (14), (15), (16), (18), (20), and (21) 2 of [section 1396d(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396d/a].

            (C) __State medicaid “wrap-around” option__ 

                At a State’s option, the State may elect to apply the option described in subsection (a)(4)(B) of this section (relating to “wrap-around” coverage) for families electing medical assistance under this subsection in the same manner as such option applies to families provided extended eligibility for medical assistance under subsection (a) of this section.

            (D) __Alternative assistance__ 

            At a State’s option, the State may offer families a choice of health care coverage under one or more of the following, instead of the medical assistance otherwise made available under this subsection:

                (i) __Enrollment in family option of employer plan__ 

                    Enrollment of the caretaker relative and dependent children in a family option of the group health plan offered to the caretaker relative.

                (ii) __Enrollment in family option of State employee plan__

A State’s payment of premiums for the enrollment of families under this subparagraph (not including any premiums otherwise payable by an employer and less the amount of premiums collected from such families under paragraph (5)) and payment of any deductibles and coinsurance shall be considered, for purposes of [section 1396b(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1396b/a/1], to be payments for medical assistance.

            (E) __Prohibition on cost-sharing for maternity and preventive pediatric care__
