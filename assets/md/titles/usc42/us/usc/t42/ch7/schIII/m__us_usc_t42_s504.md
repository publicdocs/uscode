## § 504. Judicial review

    (a) __Finding by Secretary of Labor; petition for review; filing of record__ 

    Whenever the Secretary of Labor—

        (1) finds that a State law does not include any provision specified in [section 503(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s503/a], or

        (2) makes a finding with respect to a State under subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (i), or (j) of [section 503 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s503],

        such State may, within 60 days after the Governor of the State has been notified of such action, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located or with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a petition for review of such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which he based his action as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112].

    (b) __Findings of fact by Secretary of Labor; new or modified findings__ 

        The findings of fact by the Secretary of Labor, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary of Labor to take further evidence and the Secretary of Labor may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify his previous action, and shall certify to the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.

    (c) __Affirmance or setting aside of Secretary’s action; review by Supreme Court__ 

        The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary of Labor or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in [section 1254 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1254].

    (d) __Stay of Secretary’s action__ 

        (1) The Secretary of Labor shall not withhold any certification for payment to any State under [section 502 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s502] until the expiration of 60 days after the Governor of the State has been notified of the action referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section or until the State has filed a petition for review of such action, whichever is earlier.

        (2) The commencement of judicial proceedings under this section shall stay the Secretary’s action for a period of 30 days, and the court may thereafter grant interim relief if warranted, including a further stay of the Secretary’s action and including such other relief as may be necessary to preserve status or rights.
