    (a) __Payment for durable medical equipment__ 

        (1) __General rule for payment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                With respect to a covered item (as defined in paragraph (13)) for which payment is determined under this subsection, payment shall be made in the frequency specified in paragraphs (2) through (7) and in an amount equal to 80 percent of the payment basis described in subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Payment basis__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (F)(i), the payment basis described in this subparagraph is the lesser of—

                (i) the actual charge for the item, or

                (ii) the payment amount recognized under paragraphs (2) through (7) of this subsection for the item;

                except that clause (i) shall not apply if the covered item is furnished by a public home health agency (or by another home health agency which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a significant portion of its patients are low income) free of charge or at nominal charges to the public.

            (C) __Exclusive payment rule__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (F)(ii), this subsection shall constitute the exclusive provision of this subchapter for payment for covered items under this part or under part A of this subchapter to a home health agency.

            (D) __Reduction in fee schedules for certain items__ 

                With respect to a seat-lift chair or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator furnished on or after April 1, 1990, the Secretary shall reduce the payment amount applied under subparagraph (B)(ii) for such an item by 15 percent, and, in the case of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator furnished on or after January 1, 1991, the Secretary shall further reduce such payment amount (as previously reduced) by 45 percent.

            (E) __Clinical conditions for coverage__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Secretary shall establish standards for clinical conditions for payment for covered items under this subsection.

                (ii) __Requirements__ 

                    The standards established under clause (i) shall include the specification of types or classes of covered items that require, as a condition of payment under this subsection, a face-to-face examination of the individual by a physician (as defined in [section 1395x(r) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/r]), a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist (as those terms are defined in [section 1395x(aa)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/aa/5]) and a prescription for the item.

                (iii) __Priority of establishment of standards__ 

                    In establishing the standards under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall first establish standards for those covered items for which the Secretary determines there has been a proliferation of use, consistent findings of charges for covered items that are not delivered, or consistent findings of falsification of documentation to provide for payment of such covered items under this part.

                (iv) __Standards for power wheelchairs__ 

                    Effective on December 8, 2003, in the case of a covered item consisting of a motorized or power wheelchair for an individual, payment may not be made for such covered item unless a physician (as defined in [section 1395x(r)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/r/1]), a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist (as those terms are defined in [section 1395x(aa)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395x/aa/5]) has conducted a face-to-face examination of the individual and written a prescription for the item.

                (i) the payment basis under this subsection for such items and services furnished in such area shall be the payment basis determined under such competitive acquisition program;

                (ii) the Secretary may (and, in the case of covered items furnished on or after January 1, 2016, subject to clause (iii), shall) use information on the payment determined under such competitive acquisition programs to adjust the payment amount otherwise recognized under subparagraph (B)(ii) for an area that is not a competitive acquisition area under [section 1395w–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3] and in the case of such adjustment, paragraph (10)(B) shall not be applied; and

                (iii) in the case of covered items furnished on or after January 1, 2016, the Secretary shall continue to make such adjustments described in clause (ii) as, under such competitive acquisition programs, additional covered items are phased in or information is updated as contracts under [section 1395w–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3] are recompeted in accordance with [section 1395w–3(b)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3/b/3/B].

            (G) __Use of information on competitive bid rates__ 

                The Secretary shall specify by regulation the methodology to be used in applying the provisions of subparagraph (F)(ii) and subsection (h)(1)(H)(ii).

                (i) __In general__ 

                    On or after the date described in clause (ii), the payment amount under this part for diabetic supplies, including testing strips, that are non-mail order items (as defined by the Secretary) shall be equal to the single payment amounts established under the national mail order competition for diabetic supplies under [section 1395w–3 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–3].
