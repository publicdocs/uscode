## § 1396w–1. Medicaid Improvement Fund

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall establish under this subchapter a Medicaid Improvement Fund (in this section referred to as the “Fund”) which shall be available to the Secretary to improve the management of the Medicaid program by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, including oversight of contracts and contractors and evaluation of demonstration projects. Payments made for activities under this subsection shall be in addition to payments that would otherwise be made for such activities.

    (b) __Funding__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There shall be available to the Fund, for expenditures from the Fund for fiscal year 2021 and thereafter, $5,000,000.

        (2) __Funding limitation__ 

            Amounts in the Fund shall be available in advance of appropriations but only if the total amount obligated from the Fund does not exceed the amount available to the Fund under paragraph (1). The Secretary may obligate funds from the Fund only if the Secretary determines (and the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the appropriate budget officer certify) that there are available in the Fund sufficient amounts to cover all such obligations incurred consistent with the previous sentence.

 __Amendments__ 

    2016—Subsec. (b)(1). [Pub. L. 114–198][/us/pl/114/198] amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: “There shall be available to the Fund, for expenditures from the Fund—

    “(A) for fiscal year 2014, $0; and

    “(B) for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2018, $0.”

    2010—Subsec. (b)(1)(A). [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148], § 2007(b)(1), which directed substitution of “$0” for “$100,000,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “$10,000,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and intervening amendment by [Pub. L. 111–127][/us/pl/111/127]. See below.

    [Pub. L. 111–127][/us/pl/111/127] substituted “$10,000,000” for “$100,000,000”.
