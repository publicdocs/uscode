        (1)

         each of the dollar amounts in effect for such month under subsections (a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of [section 1382 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1382], and subsection (a)(1)(A) of [section 211 of Public Law 93–66][/us/pl/93/66/s211], as specified in such subsections or as previously increased under this section, shall be increased by the amount (if any) by which—

            (B) the amount in effect for such month under such subsection; and

        (2) the amount obtained under paragraph (1) with respect to each subsection shall be further increased by the same percentage by which benefit amounts under subchapter II of this chapter are increased for such month, or, if greater (in any case where the increase under subchapter II of this chapter was determined on the basis of the wage increase percentage rather than the CPI increase percentage), the percentage by which benefit amounts under subchapter II of this chapter would be increased for such month if the increase had been determined on the basis of the CPI increase percentage, (and rounded, when not a multiple of $12, to the next lower multiple of $12), effective with respect to benefits for months after such month.
