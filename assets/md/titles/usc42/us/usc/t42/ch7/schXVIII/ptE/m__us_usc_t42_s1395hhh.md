        A project described in this subsection is a project of a qualifying hospital that is designed to improve the health care infrastructure of the hospital, including construction, renovation, or other capital improvements.

    (e) __State and local permits__

        (2) limit the right of any unit of State or local government to approve or regulate any rate of return on private equity invested in the project; or

        (3) otherwise supersede any State or local law (including any regulation) applicable to the construction or operation of the project.

    (f) __Forgiveness of indebtedness__ 

    The Secretary may forgive a loan provided to a qualifying hospital under this section under terms and conditions that are analogous to the loan forgiveness provision for student loans under part D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ([20 U.S.C. 1087a][/us/usc/t20/s1087a] et seq.), except that the Secretary shall condition such forgiveness on the establishment by the hospital of—
