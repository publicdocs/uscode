            (A) on the basis of information provided in the State’s most recent annual report submitted under [section 706(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s706/a/1], that the State has demonstrated an extraordinary unmet need for one of the activities described in subsection (a)(3) of this section, and
