        (1) __Application of coverage determination and reconsideration provisions__ 

            A PDP sponsor shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of [section 1395w–22(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/g] with respect to covered benefits under the prescription drug plan it offers under this part in the same manner as such requirements apply to an MA organization with respect to benefits it offers under an MA plan under part C of this subchapter.

        (2) __Request for a determination for the treatment of tiered formulary drug__ 

            In the case of a prescription drug plan offered by a PDP sponsor that provides for tiered cost-sharing for drugs included within a formulary and provides lower cost-sharing for preferred drugs included within the formulary, a part D eligible individual who is enrolled in the plan may request an exception to the tiered cost-sharing structure. Under such an exception, a nonpreferred drug could be covered under the terms applicable for preferred drugs if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug for treatment of the same condition either would not be as effective for the individual or would have adverse effects for the individual or both. A PDP sponsor shall have an exceptions process under this paragraph consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary for making a determination with respect to such a request. Denial of such an exception shall be treated as a coverage denial for purposes of applying subsection (h) of this section.

    (h) __Appeals__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), a PDP sponsor shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (4) and (5) of [section 1395w–22(g) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/g] with respect to benefits (including a determination related to the application of tiered cost-sharing described in subsection (g)(2) of this section) in a manner similar (as determined by the Secretary) to the manner such requirements apply to an MA organization with respect to benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option it offers under an MA plan under part C of this subchapter. In applying this paragraph only the part D eligible individual shall be entitled to bring such an appeal.

        (2) __Limitation in cases on nonformulary determinations__ 

            A part D eligible individual who is enrolled in a prescription drug plan offered by a PDP sponsor may appeal under paragraph (1) a determination not to provide for coverage of a covered part D drug that is not on the formulary under the plan only if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part D drugs on any tier of the formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual as the nonformulary drug, would have adverse effects for the individual, or both.

        (3) __Treatment of nonformulary determinations__ 

            If a PDP sponsor determines that a plan provides coverage for a covered part D drug that is not on the formulary of the plan, the drug shall be treated as being included on the formulary for purposes of [section 1395w–102(b)(4)(C)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–102/b/4/C/i].

    (i) __Privacy, confidentiality, and accuracy of enrollee records__ 

        The provisions of [section 1395w–22(h) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/h] shall apply to a PDP sponsor and prescription drug plan in the same manner as it applies to an MA organization and an MA plan.

    (j) __Treatment of accreditation__ 

    Subparagraph (A) of [section 1395w–22(e)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–22/e/4] (relating to treatment of accreditation) shall apply to a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to the following requirements, in the same manner as it applies to an MA organization with respect to the requirements in subparagraph (B) (other than clause (vii) thereof) of such section:

        (1) Subsection (b) of this section (relating to access to covered part D drugs).

        (2) Subsection (c) of this section (including quality assurance and medication therapy management).

        (3) Subsection (i) of this section (relating to confidentiality and accuracy of enrollee records).

    (k) __Public disclosure of pharmaceutical prices for equivalent drugs__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan shall provide that each pharmacy that dispenses a covered part D drug shall inform an enrollee of any differential between the price of the drug to the enrollee and the price of the lowest priced generic covered part D drug under the plan that is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent and available at such pharmacy.

        (2) __Timing of notice__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the information under paragraph (1) shall be provided at the time of purchase of the drug involved, or, in the case of dispensing by mail order, at the time of delivery of such drug.

            (B) __Waiver__ 

                The Secretary may waive subparagraph (A) in such circumstances as the Secretary may specify.

    (l) __Requirements with respect to sales and marketing activities__ 

    The following provisions shall apply to a PDP sponsor (and the agents, brokers, and other third parties representing such sponsor) in the same manner as such provisions apply to a Medicare Advantage organization (and the agents, brokers, and other third parties representing such organization):

        (1) The prohibition under [section 1395w–21(h)(4)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/h/4/C] on conducting activities described in [section 1395w–21(j)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–21/j/1].
