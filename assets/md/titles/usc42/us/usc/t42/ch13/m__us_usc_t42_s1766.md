        (4) By the first day of each month of operation, the State may provide advance payments for the month to each approved institution in an amount that reflects the full level of valid claims customarily received from such institution for one month’s operation. In the case of a newly participating institution, the amount of the advance shall reflect the State’s best estimate of the level of valid claims such institutions will submit. If the State has reason to believe that an institution will not be able to submit a valid claim covering the period for which such an advance has been made, the subsequent month’s advance payment shall be withheld until the State receives a valid claim. Payments advanced to institutions that are not subsequently deducted from a valid claim for reimbursement shall be repaid upon demand by the State.
