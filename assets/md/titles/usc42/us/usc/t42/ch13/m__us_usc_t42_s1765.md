## § 1765. Election to receive cash payments

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where a State phased out its commodity distribution facilities prior to June 30, 1974, such State may, for purposes of the programs authorized by this chapter and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \[[42 U.S.C. 1771][/us/usc/t42/s1771] et seq.\], elect to receive cash payments in lieu of donated foods. Where such an election is made, the Secretary shall make cash payments to such State in an amount equivalent in value to the donated foods that the State would otherwise have received if it had retained its commodity distribution facilities. The amount of cash payments in the case of lunches shall be governed by [section 1755(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1755/c].

    (b) When such payments are made, the State educational agency shall promptly and equitably disburse any cash it receives in lieu of commodities to eligible schools and institutions, and such disbursements shall be used by such schools and institutions to purchase United States agricultural commodities and other foods for their food service programs.
