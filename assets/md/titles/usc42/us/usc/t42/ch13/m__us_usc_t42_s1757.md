 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–193][/us/pl/104/193] designated first and second sentences as subsecs. (a) and (b), respectively, substituted “in subsection (a) of this section” for “in the preceding sentence” in subsec. (b), designated third sentence as subsec. (c) and substituted “The State educational agency may” for “Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State educational agency to”, struck out fourth and fifth sentences, designated sixth sentence as subsec. (d) and substituted “Use of funds paid to States” for “Such food costs”, and designated seventh to ninth sentences as subsecs. (e) to (g), respectively. Prior to amendment, fourth and fifth sentences read as follows: “Such disbursement to any school shall be made only for the purpose of assisting it to obtain agricultural commodities and other foods for consumption by children in the school lunch program. The terms ‘child’ and ‘children’ as used in this chapter shall be deemed to include individuals regardless of age who are determined by the State educational agency, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to have 1 or more mental or physical handicaps and who are attending any child care institution as defined in [section 1766 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1766] or any nonresidential public or nonprofit private school of high school grade or under for the purpose of participating in a school program established for individuals with mental or physical handicaps: Provided, That no institution that is not otherwise eligible to participate in the program under [section 1766 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1766] shall be deemed so eligible because of this sentence.”

    1989—[Pub. L. 101–147][/us/pl/101/147], § 312(1), substituted “school lunch” for “school-lunch” in three places.

    [Pub. L. 101–147][/us/pl/101/147], § 304, which directed the amendment of subsec. (d) by substituting “individuals” for “persons”, “to have 1 or more mental or physical handicaps” for “to be mentally or physically handicapped”, and “for individuals with mental or physical handicaps” for “for mentally or physically handicapped”, was executed by making the substitutions in the undesignated text before the proviso as the probable intent of Congress because the section contains no subsection designations.

    [Pub. L. 101–147][/us/pl/101/147], § 201, inserted after first sentence “The agreements described in the preceding sentence shall be permanent agreements that may be amended as necessary.

    1981—[Pub. L. 97–35][/us/pl/97/35] substituted references to per meal reimbursement rate, for references to Federal food-cost contribution rate wherever appearing, and struck out reference to [section 1754 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1754], and food service equipment assistance.

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–627][/us/pl/95/627] inserted provision relating to definition of “child” and “children”.

    1977—[Pub. L. 95–166][/us/pl/95/166] substituted “food service equipment assistance” for “nonfood assistance”.

    1973—[Pub. L. 93–150][/us/pl/93/150] provided that in any fiscal year in which the national average payment per lunch determined under [section 1753 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1753] is increased above the amount prescribed in the previous fiscal year, the maximum Federal food-cost contribution rate, for the type of lunch served, shall be increased by a like amount.

    1972—[Pub. L. 92–433][/us/pl/92/433] substituted provision that disbursement to schools be made for the purpose of assisting them to finance the costs of agricultural commodities, for provision that such disbursement be made for the purpose of reimbursing them for such costs and inserted provision that lunch assistance disbursements to schools under this section and [section 1759a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1759a] may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement according to procedure prescribed by the Secretary.
