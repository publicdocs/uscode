>         “(2) in fact, the National Crime Victim’s Survey, conducted annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data relating to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;

>         “(3) studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that victims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, there is sometimes a reluctance by police, prosecutors, and judges to rely on the testimony of a disabled individual, making individuals with developmental disabilities a target for criminal predators;

>         “(4)

>          research in the United States needs to be done to—

>             “(A) understand the nature and extent of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;

>             “(B) describe the manner in which the justice system responds to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and

>             “(C) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promises for making the justice system more responsive to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and

>         “(5) the National Academy of Science Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council is a premier research institution with unique experience in developing seminal, multidisciplinary studies to establish a strong research base from which to make public policy.

>     “(b) __Purposes.—__ 

>     The purposes of this Act are—

>         “(1) to increase public awareness of the plight of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;

>         “(2) to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and

>         “(3) to develop a basis to find new strategies to address the safety and justice needs of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities.

> “SEC. 3. __DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY.__ 

>     “In this Act, the term ‘developmental disability’ has the meaning given the term in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 \[[42 U.S.C. 15002][/us/usc/t42/s15002]\].

> “SEC. 4. __STUDY.__
