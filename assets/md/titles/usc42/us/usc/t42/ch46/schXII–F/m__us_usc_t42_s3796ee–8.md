## § 3796ee–8. Assessment reports

    (a) __Reports to Attorney General__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (4), for each fiscal year for which a grant or subgrant is awarded under this subchapter, each State or specially qualified unit of local government that receives such a grant shall submit to the Attorney General a grant report, and each unit of local government that receives such a subgrant shall submit to the State a subgrant report, at such time and in such manner as the Attorney General may reasonably require.

        (2) __Grant report__ 

        Each grant report required by paragraph (1) shall include—

            (A) a summary of the activities carried out with such grant;

            (B) if such activities included any subgrant, a summary of the activities carried out with each such subgrant; and

            (C) an assessment of the effectiveness of such activities on achieving the purposes of this subchapter.

        (3) __Subgrant report__ 

        Each subgrant report required by paragraph (1) shall include—

            (A) a summary of the activities carried out with such subgrant; and

            (B) an assessment of the effectiveness of such activities on achieving the purposes of this subchapter.

        (4) __Waivers__ 

        The Attorney General may waive the requirement of an assessment in paragraph (2)(C) for a State or specially qualified unit of local government, or in paragraph (3)(B) for a unit of local government, if the Attorney General determines that—

            (A) the nature of the activities are such that assessing their effectiveness would not be practical or insightful;

            (B) the amount of the grant or subgrant is such that carrying out the assessment would not be an effective use of those amounts; or

            (C) the resources available to the State or unit are such that carrying out the assessment would pose a financial hardship on the State or unit.

    (b) __Reports to Congress__ 

    Not later than 120 days after the last day of each fiscal year for which 1 or more grants are awarded under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report, which shall include—

        (1) a summary of the information provided under subsection (a) of this section;

        (2) an assessment by the Attorney General of the grant program carried out under this subchapter; and

        (3) such other information as the Attorney General considers appropriate.
