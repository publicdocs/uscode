    A State or unit of local government that receives a grant under this subchapter shall use the grant to do any one or more of the following:

        (1) To carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner services in the State, including such services provided by the laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the State.

        (2) To eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questionable documents, and trace evidence.

        (3) To train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel, as needed, to eliminate such a backlog.

    (b) __Permitted categories of funding__ 

    Subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section, a grant awarded for the purpose set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section—

        (1) may only be used for program expenses relating to facilities, personnel, computerization, equipment, supplies, accreditation and certification, education, and training; and

        (2) may not be used for any general law enforcement or nonforensic investigatory function.

    (c) __Facilities costs__ 

        (1) __States receiving minimum grant amount__ 

            With respect to a State that receives a grant under this subchapter (including grants received by units of local government within a State) in an amount that does not exceed 0.6 percent of the total amount made available to carry out this subchapter for a fiscal year, not more than 80 percent of the total amount of the grant may be used for the costs of any new facility constructed as part of a program described in subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) __Other States__ 

        With respect to a State that receives a grant under this subchapter in an amount that exceeds 0.6 percent of the total amount made available to carry out this subchapter for a fiscal year—

            (A) not more than 80 percent of the amount of the grant up to that 0.6 percent may be used for the costs of any new facility constructed as part of a program described in subsection (a) of this section; and

            (B) not more than 40 percent of the amount of the grant in excess of that 0.6 percent may be used for the costs of any new facility constructed as part of a program described in subsection (a) of this section.

        Not more than 10 percent of the total amount of a grant awarded under this subchapter may be used for administrative expenses.

    (e) __Backlog defined__ 

    For purposes of this section, a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence exists if such evidence—

        (2) has not been subjected to all appropriate forensic testing because of a lack of resources or personnel.
