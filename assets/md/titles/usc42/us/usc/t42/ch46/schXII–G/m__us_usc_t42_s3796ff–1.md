        (2) State aftercare services must involve the coordination of the correctional facility treatment program with other human service and rehabilitation programs, such as educational and job training programs, parole supervision programs, half-way house programs, and participation in self-help and peer group programs, that may aid in the rehabilitation of individuals in the substance abuse treatment program.

        (3) To qualify as an aftercare program, the head of the substance abuse treatment program, in conjunction with State and local authorities and organizations involved in substance abuse treatment, shall assist in placement of substance abuse treatment program participants with appropriate community substance abuse treatment facilities when such individuals leave the correctional facility at the end of a sentence or on parole.
