        (1) continuing judicial supervision over offenders, and other individuals under the jurisdiction of the court, with substance abuse problems who are not violent offenders;

        (2) coordination with the appropriate State or local prosecutor; and

        (3)

         the integrated administration of other sanctions and services, which shall include—

            (A) mandatory periodic testing for the use of controlled substances or other addictive substances during any period of supervised release or probation for each participant;

            (B) substance abuse treatment for each participant;

            (C) diversion, probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show satisfactory progress;

            (D) offender management, and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement, and child care or other family support services for each participant who requires such services;

            (E) payment, in whole or part, by the offender of treatment costs, to the extent practicable, such as costs for urinalysis or counseling; and

            (F) payment, in whole or part, by the offender of restitution, to the extent practicable, to either a victim of the offender’s offense or to a restitution or similar victim support fund.

    (b) __Limitation__ 

        Economic sanctions imposed on an offender pursuant to this section shall not be at a level that would interfere with the offender’s rehabilitation.

    (c) __Mandatory drug testing and mandatory sanctions__ 

        (1) __Mandatory testing__ 

        Grant amounts under this subchapter may be used for a drug court only if the drug court has mandatory periodic testing as described in subsection (a)(3)(A). The Attorney General shall, by prescribing guidelines or regulations, specify standards for the timing and manner of complying with such requirements. The standards—

            (A)

             shall ensure that—

                (ii) the testing is accurate and practicable; and

            (B) may require approval of the drug testing regime to ensure that adequate testing occurs.

        (2) __Mandatory sanctions__ 

        The Attorney General shall, by prescribing guidelines or regulations, specify that grant amounts under this subchapter may be used for a drug court only if the drug court imposes graduated sanctions that increase punitive measures, therapeutic measures, or both whenever a participant fails a drug test. Such sanctions and measures may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

            (A) Incarceration.

            (B) Detoxification treatment.

            (C) Residential treatment.

            (D) Increased time in program.
