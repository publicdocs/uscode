## § 3782. Rules, regulations, and procedures; consultations and establishment

    (a) __General authorization of certain Federal agencies__ 

        The Office of Justice Programs, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the National Institute of Justice are authorized, after appropriate consultation with representatives of States and units of local government, to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as are necessary to the exercise of their functions, and as are consistent with the stated purposes of this chapter.

    (b) __Continuing evaluation of selected programs or projects; cost, effectiveness, impact value, and comparative considerations; annual performance report; assessment of activity effectiveness; suspension of funds for nonsubmission of report__ 

    The Bureau of Justice Assistance shall, after consultation with the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, State and local governments, and the appropriate public and private agencies, establish such rules and regulations as are necessary to assure the continuing evaluation of selected programs or projects conducted pursuant to subchapters V, XII–A, XII–B, XII–C, and XII–I of this chapter, in order to determine—

        (1) whether such programs or projects have achieved the performance goals stated in the original application, are of proven effectiveness, have a record of proven success, or offer a high probability of improving the criminal justice system;

        (2) whether such programs or projects have contributed or are likely to contribute to the improvement of the criminal justice system and the reduction and prevention of crime;

        (3) their cost in relation to their effectiveness in achieving stated goals;

        (4) their impact on communities and participants; and

        (5) their implication for related programs.

        In conducting evaluations described in this subsection, the Bureau of Justice Assistance shall, when practical, compare the effectiveness of programs conducted by similar applicants and different applicants. The Bureau of Justice Assistance shall also require applicants under part A of subchapter V of this chapter to submit an annual performance report concerning activities carried out pursuant to part A of subchapter V of this chapter together with an assessment by the applicant of the effectiveness of those activities in achieving the purposes of such part A and the relationships of those activities to the needs and objectives specified by the applicant in the application submitted pursuant to [section 3752 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3752]. Such report shall include details identifying each applicant that used any funds to purchase any cruiser, boat, or helicopter and, with respect to such applicant, specifying both the amount of funds used by such applicant for each purchase of any cruiser, boat, or helicopter and a justification of each such purchase (and the Bureau of Justice Assistance shall submit to the Committee of the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee of the Judiciary of the Senate, promptly after preparation of such report a written copy of the portion of such report containing the information required by this sentence). The Bureau shall suspend funding for an approved application under part A of subchapter V of this chapter if an applicant fails to submit such an annual performance report.

    (c) __Procedures for paperwork minimization and prevention of duplication and delays in award and expenditure of funds__ 

        The procedures established to implement the provisions of this chapter shall minimize paperwork and prevent needless duplication and unnecessary delays in award and expenditure of funds at all levels of government.
