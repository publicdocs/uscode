 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 1999, and also as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, and not as part of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 which comprises this chapter.

    Par. (2). [Pub. L. 107–56, § 614][/us/pl/107/56/s614], inserted “functions, including any” after “all” and “(including, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law (unless the same should expressly refer to this section), any organization that administers any program established in title 1 of [Public Law 90–351][/us/pl/90/351])” after “that Office”.
