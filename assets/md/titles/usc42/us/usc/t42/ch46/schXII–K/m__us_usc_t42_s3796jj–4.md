        The Attorney General may award a grant each fiscal year, not to exceed $100,000 to a State or local law enforcement agency or $250,000 to a law enforcement organization for a period not to exceed 5 years. In any application from a State or local law enforcement agency or organization for a grant to continue a program for the second, third, fourth, or fifth fiscal year following the first fiscal year in which a grant was awarded to such agency, the Attorney General shall review the progress made toward meeting the objectives of the program. The Attorney General may refuse to award a grant if the Attorney General finds sufficient progress has not been made toward meeting such objectives, but only after affording the applicant notice and an opportunity for reconsideration.
