## § 3796. Payment of death benefits

    (a) __Amount; recipients__ 

    In any case in which the Bureau of Justice Assistance (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “Bureau”) determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit of $250,000, adjusted in accordance with subsection (h) of this section, as follows (if the payee indicated is living on the date on which the determination is made)—

        (1) if there is no child who survived the public safety officer, to the surviving spouse of the public safety officer;

        (2) if there is at least 1 child who survived the public safety officer and a surviving spouse of the public safety officer, 50 percent to the surviving child (or children, in equal shares) and 50 percent to the surviving spouse;

        (3) if there is no surviving spouse of the public safety officer, to the surviving child (or children, in equal shares);

        (4)

         if there is no surviving spouse of the public safety officer and no surviving child—

            (A) to the surviving individual (or individuals, in shares per the designation, or, otherwise, in equal shares) designated by the public safety officer to receive benefits under this subsection in the most recently executed designation of beneficiary of the public safety officer on file at the time of death with the public safety agency, organization, or unit; or

            (B) if there is no individual qualifying under subparagraph (A), to the surviving individual (or individuals, in equal shares) designated by the public safety officer to receive benefits under the most recently executed life insurance policy of the public safety officer on file at the time of death with the public safety agency, organization, or unit;

        (5) if there is no individual qualifying under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), to the surviving parent (or parents, in equal shares) of the public safety officer; or

        (6) if there is no individual qualifying under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), to the surviving individual (or individuals, in equal shares) who would qualify under the definition of the term “child” under [section 3796b of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3796b] but for age.

    (b) __Benefits for permanent and total disability__ 

        In accordance with regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, in any case in which the Bureau determines that a public safety officer has become permanently and totally disabled as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay the same benefit to the public safety officer (if living on the date on which the determination is made) that is payable under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the date on which the catastrophic injury occurred, as adjusted in accordance with subsection (h) of this section: Provided, That for the purposes of making these benefit payments, there are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary: Provided further, That the amount payable under this subsection shall be the amount payable as of the date of catastrophic injury of such public safety officer.

    (c) __Interim benefit payment__ 

        Whenever the Bureau determines upon showing of need and prior to final action that the death of a public safety officer is one with respect to which a benefit will probably be paid, the Bureau may make an interim benefit payment not exceeding $3,000 to the individual entitled to receive a benefit under subsection (a) of this section.

    (d) __Deduction of interim payment__ 

        The amount of an interim payment under subsection (c) of this section shall be deducted from the amount of any final benefit paid to such individual.

    (e) __Repayment of interim payment; waiver__ 

        Where there is no final benefit paid, the recipient of any interim payment under subsection (c) of this section shall be liable for repayment of such amount. The Bureau may waive all or part of such repayment, considering for this purpose the hardship which would result from such repayment.

    (f) __Reductions from final benefit payment__ 

    The benefit payable under this subchapter shall be in addition to any other benefit that may be due from any other source, except—

        (1) payments authorized by [section 12(k) of the Act of September 1, 1916][/us/act/1916-09-01/s12/k];

        (2) benefits authorized by [section 8191 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8191], such that beneficiaries shall receive only such benefits under such section 8191 as are in excess of the benefits received under this subchapter; or

        (3) payments under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 ([49 U.S.C. 40101][/us/usc/t49/s40101] note; [Public Law 107–42][/us/pl/107/42]).

    (g) __Execution or attachment prohibited__ 

        No benefit paid under this subchapter shall be subject to execution or attachment.

    (h) __Consumer Price Index adjustment__ 

        On October 1 of each fiscal year beginning after June 1, 1988, the Bureau shall adjust the level of the benefit payable immediately before such October 1 under subsection (a) of this section, to reflect the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, occurring in the 1-year period ending on June 1 immediately preceding such October 1.

    (i) __Amount payable determined as of date of death__ 

        The amount payable under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the death of a public safety officer shall be the amount payable under subsection (a) of this section as of the date of death of such officer.

    (j) __Limitations on benefits__ 

        (1) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of a public safety officer if a benefit is paid under this subchapter with respect to the disability of such officer.

        (2) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the disability of a public safety officer if a benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of such public safety officer.

    (k) __Death by heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture; presumption__ 

    As determined by the Bureau, a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture suffered by a public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of subsection (a), sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and proximately resulting in death, if—

        (1)

         the public safety officer, while on duty—

            (A) engages in a situation involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical law enforcement, fire suppression, rescue, hazardous material response, emergency medical services, prison security, disaster relief, or other emergency response activity; or

            (B) participates in a training exercise involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity;

        (2)

         the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture commences—

            (A) while the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1);

            (B) while the officer remains on that duty after being engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); or

            (C) not later than 24 hours after the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); and

        (3) the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture directly and proximately results in the death of the public safety officer,

        unless competent medical evidence establishes that the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture was unrelated to the engagement or participation or was directly and proximately caused by something other than the mere presence of cardiovascular-disease risk factors.

    (l) __Definition__ 

        For purposes of subsection (k) of this section, “nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical” excludes actions of a clerical, administrative, or nonmanual nature.

    (m) __Suspension or end of collection action__ 

        The Bureau may suspend or end collection action on an amount disbursed pursuant to a statute enacted retroactively or otherwise disbursed in error under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, where such collection would be impractical, or would cause undue hardship to a debtor who acted in good faith.

    (n) __Confidentiality__ 

        The public safety agency, organization, or unit responsible for maintaining on file an executed designation of beneficiary or executed life insurance policy for purposes of subsection (a)(4) shall maintain the confidentiality of the designation or policy in the same manner as the agency, organization, or unit maintains personnel or other similar records of the public safety officer.
