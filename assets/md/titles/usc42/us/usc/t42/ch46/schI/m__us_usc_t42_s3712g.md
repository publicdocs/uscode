## § 3712g. Availability of funds

    (a) __Period for awarding grant funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Unless otherwise specifically provided in an authorization, DOJ grant funds for a fiscal year shall remain available to be awarded and distributed to a grantee only in that fiscal year and the three succeeding fiscal years, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3). DOJ grant funds not so awarded and distributed shall revert to the Treasury.

        (2) __Treatment of reprogrammed funds__ 

            DOJ grant funds for a fiscal year that are reprogrammed in a later fiscal year shall be treated for purposes of paragraph (1) as DOJ grant funds for such later fiscal year.

        (3) __Treatment of deobligated funds__ 

            If DOJ grant funds were obligated and then deobligated, the period of availability that applies to those grant funds under paragraph (1) shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days from the date on which those grant funds were obligated to the date on which those grant funds were deobligated.

    (b) __Period for expending grant funds__ 

        DOJ grant funds for a fiscal year that have been awarded and distributed to a grantee may be expended by that grantee only in the period permitted under the terms of the grant. DOJ grant funds not so expended shall be deobligated.

    (c) __Definition__ 

        In this section, the term “DOJ grant funds” means, for a fiscal year, amounts appropriated for activities of the Department of Justice in carrying out grant programs for that fiscal year.

    (d) __Applicability__ 

        This section applies to DOJ grant funds for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2006.
