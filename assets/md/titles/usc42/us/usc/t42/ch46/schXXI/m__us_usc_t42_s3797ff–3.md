    (2)

     focuses on communities that have been disproportionately impacted by opioid abuse as evidenced in part by—

        (A) high rates of primary treatment admissions for heroin and other opioids;

        (B) high rates of drug poisoning deaths from heroin and other opioids; and

        (C) a lack of accessibility to treatment providers and facilities and to emergency medical services.
