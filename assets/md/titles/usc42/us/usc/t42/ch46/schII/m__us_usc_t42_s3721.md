    It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a National Institute of Justice, which shall provide for and encourage research and demonstration efforts for the purpose of—

    (1) improving Federal, State, and local criminal justice systems and related aspects of the civil justice system;

    (2) preventing and reducing crimes;

    (3) insuring citizen access to appropriate dispute-resolution forums; and

    (4) identifying programs of proven effectiveness, programs having a record of proven success, or programs which offer a high probability of improving the functioning of the criminal justice system.

    The Institute shall have authority to engage in and encourage research and development to improve and strengthen the criminal justice system and related aspects of the civil justice system and to disseminate the results of such efforts to Federal, State, and local governments, to evaluate the effectiveness of programs funded under this chapter, to develop and demonstrate new or improved approaches and techniques, to improve and strengthen the administration of justice, and to identify programs or projects carried out under this chapter which have demonstrated success in improving the quality of justice systems and which offer the likelihood of success if continued or repeated. In carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, the Institute shall give primary emphasis to the problems of State and local justice systems and shall insure that there is a balance between basic and applied research.
