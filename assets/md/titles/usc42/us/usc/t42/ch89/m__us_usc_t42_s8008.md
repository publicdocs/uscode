## § 8008. Funding procedures

    (a)

     The Secretary shall establish procedures—

        (1) to assure timely payments to nonprofit corporations and public housing agencies for approved assisted congregate services programs with provision made for advance funding sufficient to meet necessary startup costs;

        (2) to permit reallocation of funds approved for the establishment of congregate services in existing public housing projects and projects assisted under [section 1701q of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1701q] if the services are not established within six months of the notification date of funding approval;

        (3) to assure that where such funding has been approved for the establishment of congregate services for public housing projects and projects assisted under [section 1701q of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1701q] under construction or approved for construction, these services shall be in place at the start of the project’s occupancy by tenants requiring such services for maintaining independent living;

        (4) to establish accounting and other standards in order to prevent any fraudulent or inappropriate use of funds under this chapter; and

        (5) to assure that no more than 1 per centum of the funds appropriated under this chapter for any fiscal year may be used by public housing agencies and nonprofit corporations for evaluative purposes as required by [section 8007(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8007/b/1].

    (b) The Secretary shall establish a reserve fund, not to exceed 10 per centum of the funds appropriated in each fiscal year for the provision of services under this chapter, in order to supplement grants awarded to public housing agencies and nonprofit corporations under this chapter when, in the determination of the Secretary, such supplemental adjustments are required to maintain adequate levels of services to eligible project residents.
