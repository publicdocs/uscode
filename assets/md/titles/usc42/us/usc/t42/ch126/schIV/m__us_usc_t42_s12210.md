## § 12210. Illegal use of drugs

    (a) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this chapter, the term “individual with a disability” does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use.

    (b) __Rules of construction__ 

    Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to exclude as an individual with a disability an individual who—

        (1) has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;

        (2) is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or

        (3) is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use;

        except that it shall not be a violation of this chapter for a covered entity to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing, designed to ensure that an individual described in paragraph (1) or (2) is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs; however, nothing in this section shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.

    (c) __Health and other services__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and [section 12211(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12211/b/3], an individual shall not be denied health services, or services provided in connection with drug rehabilitation, on the basis of the current illegal use of drugs if the individual is otherwise entitled to such services.
