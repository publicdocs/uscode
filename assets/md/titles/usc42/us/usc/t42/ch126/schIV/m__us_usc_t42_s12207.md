## § 12207. Federal wilderness areas

    (a) __Study__ 

        The National Council on Disability shall conduct a study and report on the effect that wilderness designations and wilderness land management practices have on the ability of individuals with disabilities to use and enjoy the National Wilderness Preservation System as established under the Wilderness Act ([16 U.S.C. 1131][/us/usc/t16/s1131] et seq.).

    (b) __Submission of report__ 

        Not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, the National Council on Disability shall submit the report required under subsection (a) of this section to Congress.

    (c) __Specific wilderness access__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Congress reaffirms that nothing in the Wilderness Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1131][/us/usc/t16/s1131] et seq.\] is to be construed as prohibiting the use of a wheelchair in a wilderness area by an individual whose disability requires use of a wheelchair, and consistent with the Wilderness Act no agency is required to provide any form of special treatment or accommodation, or to construct any facilities or modify any conditions of lands within a wilderness area in order to facilitate such use.

        (2) __“Wheelchair” defined__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “wheelchair” means a device designed solely for use by a mobility-impaired person for locomotion, that is suitable for use in an indoor pedestrian area.
