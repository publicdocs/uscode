## § 12142. Public entities operating fixed route systems

    (a) __Purchase and lease of new vehicles__ 

        It shall be considered discrimination for purposes of [section 12132 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12132] and [section 794 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s794] for a public entity which operates a fixed route system to purchase or lease a new bus, a new rapid rail vehicle, a new light rail vehicle, or any other new vehicle to be used on such system, if the solicitation for such purchase or lease is made after the 30th day following July 26, 1990, and if such bus, rail vehicle, or other vehicle is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.

    (b) __Purchase and lease of used vehicles__ 

        Subject to subsection (c)(1) of this section, it shall be considered discrimination for purposes of [section 12132 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12132] and [section 794 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s794] for a public entity which operates a fixed route system to purchase or lease, after the 30th day following July 26, 1990, a used vehicle for use on such system unless such entity makes demonstrated good faith efforts to purchase or lease a used vehicle for use on such system that is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.

    (c) __Remanufactured vehicles__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be considered discrimination for purposes of [section 12132 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12132] and [section 794 of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s794] for a public entity which operates a fixed route system—

            (A) to remanufacture a vehicle for use on such system so as to extend its usable life for 5 years or more, which remanufacture begins (or for which the solicitation is made) after the 30th day following July 26, 1990; or

            (B) to purchase or lease for use on such system a remanufactured vehicle which has been remanufactured so as to extend its usable life for 5 years or more, which purchase or lease occurs after such 30th day and during the period in which the usable life is extended;

            unless, after remanufacture, the vehicle is, to the maximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.

        (2) __Exception for historic vehicles__ 

            (A) __General rule__ 

                If a public entity operates a fixed route system any segment of which is included on the National Register of Historic Places and if making a vehicle of historic character to be used solely on such segment readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities would significantly alter the historic character of such vehicle, the public entity only has to make (or to purchase or lease a remanufactured vehicle with) those modifications which are necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) and which do not significantly alter the historic character of such vehicle.

            (B) __Vehicles of historic character defined by regulations__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph and [section 12148(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12148/b], a vehicle of historic character shall be defined by the regulations issued by the Secretary to carry out this subsection.

([Pub. L. 101–336, title II][/us/pl/101/336/tII], § 222, July 26, 1990, [104 Stat. 339][/us/stat/104/339].)
