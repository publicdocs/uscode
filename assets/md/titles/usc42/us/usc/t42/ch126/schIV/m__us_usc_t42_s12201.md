## § 12201. Construction

    (a) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ([29 U.S.C. 790][/us/usc/t29/s790] et seq.) or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to such title.

    (b) __Relationship to other laws__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any Federal law or law of any State or political subdivision of any State or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude the prohibition of, or the imposition of restrictions on, smoking in places of employment covered by subchapter I, in transportation covered by subchapter II or III, or in places of public accommodation covered by subchapter III.

    (c) __Insurance__ 

    Subchapters I through III of this chapter and title IV of this Act shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict—

        (1) an insurer, hospital or medical service company, health maintenance organization, or any agent, or entity that administers benefit plans, or similar organizations from underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law; or

        (2) a person or organization covered by this chapter from establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law; or

        (3) a person or organization covered by this chapter from establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that is not subject to State laws that regulate insurance.

        Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of subchapter  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “subchapters”. </sup></sup>  I and III.

    (d) __Accommodations and services__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require an individual with a disability to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit which such individual chooses not to accept.

        Nothing in this chapter alters the standards for determining eligibility for benefits under State worker’s compensation laws or under State and Federal disability benefit programs.

    (f) __Fundamental alteration__ 

        Nothing in this chapter alters the provision of [section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12182/b/2/A/ii], specifying that reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures shall be required, unless an entity can demonstrate that making such modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, including academic requirements in postsecondary education, would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations involved.

    (g) __Claims of no disability__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall provide the basis for a claim by an individual without a disability that the individual was subject to discrimination because of the individual’s lack of disability.

    (h) __Reasonable accommodations and modifications__ 

        A covered entity under subchapter I, a public entity under subchapter II, and any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation under subchapter III, need not provide a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability in [section 12102(1) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s12102/1] solely under subparagraph (C) of such section.
