## § 5511. Federally assisted or federally constructed housing

    (a) __Maximum dollar amount of federally assisted mortgage loan or maximum per unit or other cost or floor area limitation of federally constructed housing__ 

        (1) In determining the maximum dollar amount of any federally assisted mortgage loan (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) or the maximum per unit or other cost or floor area limitation of any federally constructed housing (as defined in subsection (c) of this section), where the law establishing the program under which the loan is made or the housing is constructed specifies such maximum per unit or other cost on floor area limitation and the structure involved is furnished with solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment under the demonstration program established by section 5503, 5504, or 5507 of this title, the maximum amount or cost or floor area limitation so specified which is applicable to such structure shall be deemed to be increased by the amount by which (as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary of Defense, as appropriate) the price or cost or floor area limitation of the structure including such solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment exceeds the price or cost or floor area limitation of the structure with such equipment replaced by conventional heating equipment or conventional heating and cooling equipment (as the case may be).

        (2) In addition, in the case of a federally assisted mortgage loan, the cost excess specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be fully taken into account in determining the value or cost of the structure involved for purposes of applying any statutory provision specifying the maximum loan-to-value or -cost ratio; except that, if the law specifies different rates of downpayment for successive increments of such value or cost, the lowest such rate shall apply to the additional cost attributable to the solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment, and such equipment shall otherwise be excluded in determining the total value or cost of the structure.

    (b) __“Mortgage loan” and “federally assisted mortgage loan” defined__ 

    As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term “mortgage loan” means a loan which is made to finance the purchase or construction of a residence or any other building or structure; and the term “federally assisted mortgage loan” means a mortgage loan which—

        (1) is made in whole or in part by any lender the deposits or accounts of which are insured by any agency of the Federal Government, or is made in whole or in part by any lender which is itself regulated by any agency of the Federal Government; or

        (2) is made in whole or in part, or insured, guaranteed, supplemented, or assisted in any way, by the Secretary or any other officer or agency of the Federal Government or under or in connection with a housing, urban development, or related program administered by the Secretary or a housing or related program administered by any other such officer or agency; or

        (3) is eligible for purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or from any financial institution from which it could be purchased by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; or

        (4) is made in whole or in part by any “creditor,” as defined in section 1602(f)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 15, who makes or invests in residential real estate loans aggregating more than $1,000,000 per year.

    (c) __“Federally constructed housing” defined__ 

        As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term “federally constructed housing” means (1) residential or multifamily housing which is constructed by agencies of the Federal Government to provide dwelling accommodations for particular types or classes of persons under programs administered by such Federal agencies (including all housing constructed by the Department of Defense to provide dwelling accommodations for personnel of the armed services or for such personnel and their families), and (2) residential or multifamily housing which is constructed by agencies of State or local government, with financial assistance in any form from the Federal Government, to provide dwelling accommodations for particular types or classes of persons under programs administered by such State or local agencies.
