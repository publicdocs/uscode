## § 5592. Priorities

The Secretary shall set priorities, as far as possible consistent with the intent and operation of this subchapter, in accordance with the following criteria:

    (1) The applications utilizing photovoltaic systems which will be part of the research, development, and demonstration program and testing and demonstration programs referred to in sections 5583, 5584, 5585, and 5586 of this title shall be located in a sufficient number of different geographic areas in the United States to assure a realistic and effective demonstration of the use of photovoltaic systems and of the applications themselves, in both rural and urban locations and under climatic conditions which vary as much as possible.

    (2) The projected costs of commercial production and maintenance of the photovoltaic systems utilized in the testing and demonstration programs established under this subchapter should be taken into account.

    (3) Encouragement should be given in the conduct of programs under this subchapter to those projects in which funds are appropriated by any State or political subdivision thereof for the purpose of sharing costs with the Federal Government for the purchase and installation of photovoltaic components and systems.
