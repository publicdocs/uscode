            (A) technical information (including reports, journal articles, dissertations, monographs, and project descriptions) on solar energy research, development, and applications;

            (B) similar technical information on the design, construction, and maintenance of equipment utilizing solar energy;

            (C) general information on solar energy applications to be disseminated for popular consumption;

            (D) physical and chemical properties of materials required for solar energy activities and equipment; and

            (E) engineering performance data on equipment and devices utilizing solar energy.

        (3)
