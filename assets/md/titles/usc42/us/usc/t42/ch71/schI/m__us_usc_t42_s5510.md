    In addition, the Secretary shall—

        (1) study and investigate the effect of building codes, zoning ordinances, tax regulations, and other laws, codes, ordinances, and practices upon the practical use of solar energy for the heating and cooling of buildings;

        (2) determine the extent to which such laws, codes, ordinances, and practices should be changed to permit or facilitate such use, and the methods by which any such changes may best be brought about; and

        (3) study the necessity of a program of incentives to accelerate the commercial application of solar heating and cooling technology.

    (c) __Establishment and operation of Solar Heating and Cooling Information Data Bank; retrieval and dissemination services; compilation of information for use by governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations and private persons; utilization of existing information__ 

        (1) In carrying out his functions under subsections (a) and (b) of this section the Secretary, utilizing the capabilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Commerce, and the Secretary of Energy to the maximum extent possible, shall establish and operate a Solar Heating and Cooling Information Data Bank (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “bank”) for the purpose of collecting, reviewing, processing, and disseminating solar heating and cooling information and data in a timely and accurate manner in support of the objectives of this subchapter.

        (2)

         Information and data compiled in the bank shall include—

            (A) technical information (including reports, journal articles, dissertions, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “dissertations,”. </sup></sup>  monographs, and project descriptions) on solar energy research, development, and applications;

            (B) technical information on the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings compatible with solar heating and cooling concepts;

            (C) physical and chemical properties of the materials required for solar heating and cooling;

            (D) climatic conditions in appropriate areas of the United States, including those areas where the demonstrations are to be located; and

            (E) engineering performance of devices utilized in solar heating and cooling or to be employed in the demonstrations.

        (3)

         In accordance with regulations prescribed under [section 5514 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5514], the Secretary shall provide retrieval and dissemination services to cover the solar heating and cooling information described under paragraph (2) for—

            (A) Federal, State, and local government organizations that are active in the area of energy resources (and their contractors);

            (B) universities, colleges, and other nonprofit organizations; and

            (C) private persons, upon request, in appropriate cases.

        (4) In carrying out his functions under this subsection, the Secretary shall utilize, when feasible, the existing data base of scientific and technical information in Federal agencies, adding to such data base any information described in paragraph (2) which does not already reside in such base.

    (d) __Annual reports to President and Congress by officers and agencies; contents; special annual report by Secretary__ 

        Each Federal officer and agency having functions under this subchapter shall include in his or its annual report to the President and the Congress a full and complete description of his or its activities (current and projected) under this subchapter, along with his or its recommendations for legislative, administrative, or other action to improve the programs under this subchapter or to achieve the objectives of this subchapter more promptly and effectively.
