## § 5584. Federal assistance application procedures; selection of applicants; agreements; financial assistance; observation and monitoring of photovoltaic systems; reports; projects and activities

    (a)

     In carrying out the provisions of [section 5583 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5583], the Secretary is authorized—

        (1) to establish procedures whereby any public or private entity wishing to install solar photovoltaic components and systems in any new or existing facility may apply for Federal assistance in purchasing and installing, in such facility, photovoltaic components or systems;

        (2) to select, as soon as he deems it feasible, a number of the applicants under paragraph (1) and enter into agreements with them for the design, purchase, fabrication, testing, installation, and demonstration of photovoltaic components and systems. Such selection shall be based on the need to obtain scientific, technological, and economic information from a variety of such systems under a variety of circumstances and conditions; and

        (3) to arrange, as part of any agreement entered into under paragraph (2), to provide up to 75 per centum of the purchase and installation costs of photovoltaic components or systems, taking into account relevant considerations involving the relative stage of consumer and industry interest and development at the time of the financial assistance action. Such arrangements shall be contingent upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, including an express agreement that the entity with whom the agreement is entered into shall, in such manner and form and on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, observe and monitor (or permit the Secretary or his agents to observe and monitor) the performance and operation of such system for a period of five years, and that such entity (including any subsequent owner of the property) shall regularly furnish the Secretary with such reports thereon as the agreement may require.

    (b) The Secretary shall, as he deems appropriate, undertake any projects or activities (including demonstration projects) to further the attainment of the objectives of this section.
