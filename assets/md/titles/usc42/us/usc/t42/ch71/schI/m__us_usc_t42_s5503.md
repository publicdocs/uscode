## § 5503. Development and demonstration of solar heating systems for use in residential dwellings

    (a) __Functions of Administrator and Secretary__ 

        The Administrator and the Secretary shall promptly initiate and carry out a program, as provided in this section, for the development and demonstration of solar heating systems (including collectors, controls, and thermal storage) for use in residential dwellings.

    (b) __Time for determination, prescription and publishing of interim performance criteria; selection of designs for suitable dwellings__ 

        (1)

         Within 120 days after September 3, 1974, the Secretary, utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy, shall determine, prescribe, and publish—

            (A) interim performance criteria for solar heating components and systems to be used in residential dwellings, and

            (B) interim performance criteria (relating to suitability for solar heating) for such dwellings themselves,

            taking into account in each instance climatic variations existing between different geographic areas.

        (2) As soon as possible after the publication of the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Administrator, will select on the basis of open competition a number of designs for various types of residential dwellings suitable for and adapted to the installation of solar heating systems meeting the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1)(A).

    (c) __Contracts and grants for development of heating systems for commercial production and residential use; contracts for procurement of heating systems and components__ 

    The Administrator, in accordance with the applicable provisions of subchapter II of chapter 201 of title 51 and under program guidelines established jointly by the Administrator and the Secretary, shall, after consultation with the Secretary—

        (1) enter into such contracts and grants as may be necessary or appropriate for the development (for commercial production and residential use) of solar heating systems meeting the performance criteria prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section (including any further planning and design which may be required to conform with the specifications set forth in such criteria); and

        (2) enter into contracts with a number of persons or firms for the procurement of solar heating components and systems meeting such performance criteria (including adequate numbers of spare and replacement parts for such systems).

    (d) __Installation of heating systems; operation during demonstration period; title and ownership of dwellings and systems; agreement of owner to observe and monitor system for five years; reports by owner__ 

        The Secretary shall (1) arrange for the installation of solar heating systems procured by the Administrator under subsection (c)(2) of this section in a substantial number of residential dwellings and (2) provide for the satisfactory operation of such installations during the demonstration period. Title to and ownership of any dwellings constructed hereunder and of solar heating systems installed hereunder may be conveyed to purchasers or owners of such dwellings under terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, including an express agreement that any such purchaser or owner shall, in such manner and form and on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, observe and monitor (or permit the Secretary to observe and monitor) the performance and operation of such system for a period of five years, and that such purchaser or owner (including any subsequent owner and occupant of the property who also makes such an agreement) shall regularly furnish the Secretary with such reports thereon as the agreement may require.

    (e) __Installation of heating systems by Secretary of Defense in dwellings located on Federal or federally administered property__ 

        The Secretary of Defense shall arrange for the installation of solar heating systems procured by the Administrator under subsection (c)(2) of this section in a substantial number of residential dwellings which are located on Federal or federally administered property where the performance and operation of such systems can be regularly and effectively observed and monitored by designated Federal personnel.

    (f) __Coordination of activities to assure a realistic and effective demonstration__ 

        The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense, and officials responsible for administering Federal or federally administered property, shall coordinate their activities under this section to assure that solar heating systems are installed in a substantial number of residential dwellings and in a sufficient number of different geographic areas under varying climatic conditions to constitute a realistic and effective demonstration in support of the objectives of this subchapter.
