## § 17154. Use of funds

    An eligible entity may use a grant received under this part to carry out activities to achieve the purposes of the program, including—

    (1) development and implementation of an energy efficiency and conservation strategy under [section 17155(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17155/b];

    (2)

     retaining technical consultant services to assist the eligible entity in the development of such a strategy, including—

        (A) formulation of energy efficiency, energy conservation, and energy usage goals;

        (B)

         identification of strategies to achieve those goals—

            (i) through efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption; and

            (ii) by encouraging behavioral changes among the population served by the eligible entity;

        (C) development of methods to measure progress in achieving the goals;

        (D)

         development and publication of annual reports to the population served by the eligible entity describing—

            (i) the strategies and goals; and

            (ii) the progress made in achieving the strategies and goals during the preceding calendar year; and

        (E) other services to assist in the implementation of the energy efficiency and conservation strategy;

    (3) conducting residential and commercial building energy audits;

    (4) establishment of financial incentive programs for energy efficiency improvements;

    (5) the provision of grants to nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies for the purpose of performing energy efficiency retrofits;
