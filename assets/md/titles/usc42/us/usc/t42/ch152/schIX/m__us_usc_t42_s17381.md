## § 17381. Statement of policy on modernization of electricity grid

    It is the policy of the United States to support the modernization of the Nation’s electricity transmission and distribution system to maintain a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand growth and to achieve each of the following, which together characterize a Smart Grid:

    (1) Increased use of digital information and controls technology to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid.

    (2) Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with full cyber-security.

    (3) Deployment and integration of distributed resources and generation, including renewable resources.

    (4) Development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources, and energy-efficiency resources.

    (5) Deployment of “smart” technologies (real-time, automated, interactive technologies that optimize the physical operation of appliances and consumer devices) for metering, communications concerning grid operations and status, and distribution automation.

    (6) Integration of “smart” appliances and consumer devices.

    (7) Deployment and integration of advanced electricity storage and peak-shaving technologies, including plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and thermal-storage air conditioning.

    (8) Provision to consumers of timely information and control options.

    (9) Development of standards for communication and interoperability of appliances and equipment connected to the electric grid, including the infrastructure serving the grid.

    (10) Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriers to adoption of smart grid technologies, practices, and services.
