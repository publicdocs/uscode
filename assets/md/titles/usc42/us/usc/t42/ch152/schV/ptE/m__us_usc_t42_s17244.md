## § 17244. Renewable Energy Innovation Manufacturing Partnership

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        The Secretary shall carry out a program, to be known as the Renewable Energy Innovation Manufacturing Partnership Program (referred to in this section as the “Program”), to make assistance awards to eligible entities for use in carrying out research, development, and demonstration relating to the manufacturing of renewable energy technologies.

    (b) __Solicitation__ 

        To carry out the Program, the Secretary shall annually conduct a competitive solicitation for assistance awards for an eligible project described in subsection (e).

    (c) __Program purposes__ 

    The purposes of the Program are—

        (1) to develop, or aid in the development of, advanced manufacturing processes, materials, and infrastructure;

        (2) to increase the domestic production of renewable energy technology and components; and

        (3) to better coordinate Federal, State, and private resources to meet regional and national renewable energy goals through advanced manufacturing partnerships.

    (d) __Eligible entities__ 

    An entity shall be eligible to receive an assistance award under the Program to carry out an eligible project described in subsection (e) if the entity is composed of—

        (1) 1 or more public or private nonprofit institutions or national laboratories engaged in research, development, demonstration, or technology transfer, that would participate substantially in the project; and

        (2) 1 or more private entities engaged in the manufacturing or development of renewable energy system components (including solar energy, wind energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy storage, or fuel cells).

    (e) __Eligible projects__ 

    An eligible entity may use an assistance award provided under this section to carry out a project relating to—

        (1) the conduct of studies of market opportunities for component manufacturing of renewable energy systems;

        (2) the conduct of multiyear applied research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects for advanced manufacturing processes, materials, and infrastructure for renewable energy systems; and

        (3) other similar ventures, as approved by the Secretary, that promote advanced manufacturing of renewable technologies.

    (f) __Criteria and guidelines__ 

        The Secretary shall establish criteria and guidelines for the submission, evaluation, and funding of proposed projects under the Program.
