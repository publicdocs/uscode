## § 17194. Enhanced geothermal systems research and development

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for enhanced geothermal systems, including the programs described in subsection (b).

    (b) __Programs__ 

        (1) __Enhanced geothermal systems technologies__ 

        The Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of the technologies and knowledge necessary for enhanced geothermal systems to advance to a state of commercial readiness, including advances in—

            (A) reservoir stimulation;

            (B) reservoir characterization, monitoring, and modeling;

            (C) stress mapping;

            (D) tracer development;

            (E) three-dimensional tomography; and

            (F) understanding seismic effects of reservoir engineering and stimulation.

        (2) __Enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation__ 

            (A) __Program__ 

            In collaboration with industry partners, the Secretary shall support a program of research, development, and demonstration of enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation technologies and techniques. A minimum of 4 sites shall be selected in locations that show particular promise for enhanced geothermal systems development. Each site shall—

                (i) represent a different class of subsurface geologic environments; and

                (ii) take advantage of an existing site where subsurface characterization has been conducted or existing drill holes can be utilized, if possible.

            (B) __Consideration of existing site__ 

                The Desert Peak, Nevada, site, where a Department of Energy and industry cooperative enhanced geothermal systems project is already underway, may be considered for inclusion among the sites selected under subparagraph (A).
