                (vi) petroleum refining;

                (vii) mining; and

                (viii) steel;

            (E) other energy-intensive industries, as determined by the Secretary.

        (3) __Feedstock__ 

            The term “feedstock” means the raw material supplied for use in manufacturing, chemical, and biological processes.

        (4) __Partnership__ 

            The term “partnership” means an energy efficiency partnership established under subsection (c)(1)(A).

        (5) __Program__ 

            The term “program” means the energy-intensive industries program established under subsection (b).

    (b) __Establishment of program__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a program under which the Secretary, in cooperation with energy-intensive industries and national industry trade associations representing the energy-intensive industries, shall support, research, develop, and promote the use of new materials processes, technologies, and techniques to optimize energy efficiency and the economic competitiveness of the United States’ industrial and commercial sectors.

    (c) __Partnerships__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        As part of the program, the Secretary shall establish energy efficiency partnerships between the Secretary and eligible entities to conduct research on, develop, and demonstrate new processes, technologies, and operating practices and techniques to significantly improve the energy efficiency of equipment and processes used by energy-intensive industries, including the conduct of activities to—

            (A) increase the energy efficiency of industrial processes and facilities;

            (B) research, develop, and demonstrate advanced technologies capable of energy intensity reductions and increased environmental performance; and

            (C) promote the use of the processes, technologies, and techniques described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2) __Eligible activities__ 

        Partnership activities eligible for funding under this subsection include—

            (A)

             feedstock and recycling research, development, and demonstration activities to identify and promote—

                (i) opportunities for meeting industry feedstock requirements with more energy efficient and flexible sources of feedstock or energy supply;

                (ii) strategies to develop and deploy technologies that improve the quality and quantity of feedstocks recovered from process and waste streams; and

                (iii) other methods using recycling, reuse, and improved industrial materials;

            (B) research to develop and demonstrate technologies and processes that utilize alternative energy sources to supply heat, power, and new feedstocks for energy-intensive industries;

            (C) research to achieve energy efficiency in steam, power, control system, and process heat technologies, and in other manufacturing processes; and

            (D)

             industrial and commercial energy efficiency and sustainability assessments to—

                (i)

                 assist individual industrial and commercial sectors in developing tools, techniques, and methodologies to assess—

                    (I) the unique processes and facilities of the sectors;

                    (II) the energy utilization requirements of the sectors; and

                    (III) the application of new, more energy efficient technologies; and

                (ii) conduct energy savings assessments;

            (E) the incorporation of technologies and innovations that would significantly improve the energy efficiency and utilization of energy-intensive commercial applications; and
