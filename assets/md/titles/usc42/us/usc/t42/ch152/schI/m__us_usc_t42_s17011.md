        (3) __Electric transportation technology__ 

        The term “electric transportation technology” means—

            (A) technology used in vehicles that use an electric motor for all or part of the motive power of the vehicles, including battery electric, hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel cell, and plug-in fuel cell vehicles, or rail transportation; or

            (B)

             equipment relating to transportation or mobile sources of air pollution that use an electric motor to replace an internal combustion engine for all or part of the work of the equipment, including—

                (i) corded electric equipment linked to transportation or mobile sources of air pollution; and

                (ii) electrification technologies at airports, ports, truck stops, and material-handling facilities.

        (4) __Nonroad vehicle__ 

        The term “nonroad vehicle” means a vehicle—

            (A)

             powered—

                (i) by a nonroad engine, as that term is defined in [section 7550 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7550]; or

                (ii) fully or partially by an electric motor powered by a fuel cell, a battery, or an off-board source of electricity; and

            (B) that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition.

        (5) __Plug-in electric drive vehicle__ 

        The term “plug-in electric drive vehicle” means a vehicle that—

            (A) draws motive power from a battery with a capacity of at least 4 kilowatt-hours;

            (B) can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power; and

            (C) is a light-, medium-, or heavy-duty motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle (as those terms are defined in [section 7550 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7550]).

        (6) __Qualified electric transportation project__ 

        The term “qualified electric transportation project” means an electric transportation technology project that would significantly reduce emissions of criteria pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and petroleum, including—

            (A) shipside or shoreside electrification for vessels;

            (B) truck-stop electrification;

            (C) electric truck refrigeration units;

            (D) battery-powered auxiliary power units for trucks;

            (E) electric airport ground support equipment;

            (F) electric material and cargo handling equipment;

            (G) electric or dual-mode electric rail;

            (H) any distribution upgrades needed to supply electricity to the project; and

            (I) any ancillary infrastructure, including panel upgrades, battery chargers, in-situ transformers, and trenching.

    (b) __Plug-in electric drive vehicle program__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a competitive program to provide grants on a cost-shared basis to State governments, local governments, metropolitan transportation authorities, air pollution control districts, private or nonprofit entities, or combinations of those governments, authorities, districts, and entities, to carry out one or more projects to encourage the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles or other emerging electric vehicle technologies, as determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Administration__ 

            The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator, establish requirements for applications for grants under this section, including reporting of data to be summarized for dissemination to grantees and the public, including safety, vehicle, and component performance, and vehicle and component life cycle costs.

        (3) __Priority__ 

        In making awards under this subsection, the Secretary shall—

            (A)

             give priority consideration to applications that—

                (i) encourage early widespread use of vehicles described in paragraph (1); and

                (ii) are likely to make a significant contribution to the advancement of the production of the vehicles in the United States; and

            (B) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the program established under this subsection includes a variety of applications, manufacturers, and end-uses.

        (4) __Reporting__ 

            The Secretary shall require a grant recipient under this subsection to submit to the Secretary, on an annual basis, data relating to safety, vehicle performance, life cycle costs, and emissions of vehicles demonstrated under the grant, including emissions of greenhouse gases.

        (5) __Cost sharing__ 

            [Section 16352 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s16352] shall apply to a grant made under this subsection.

        (6) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

            There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $90,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012, of which not less than ⅓ of the total amount appropriated shall be available each fiscal year to make grants to local and municipal governments.

    (c) __Near-term transportation sector electrification program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 1 year after December 19, 2007, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator, shall establish a program to provide grants for the conduct of qualified electric transportation projects.

        (2) __Priority__ 

            In providing grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to large-scale projects and large-scale aggregators of projects.

        (3) __Cost sharing__ 

            [Section 16352 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s16352] shall apply to a grant made under this subsection.
