## § 17085. Tenant Star program

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __High-performance energy efficiency measure__ 

            The term “high-performance energy efficiency measure” has the meaning given the term in [section 17084 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17084].

        (2) __Separate spaces__ 

            The term “separate spaces” has the meaning given the term in [section 17084 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17084].

    (b) __Tenant Star__ 

        The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall develop a voluntary program within the Energy Star program established by [section 6294a of this title][/us/usc/t42/s6294a], which may be known as “Tenant Star”, to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants or otherwise occupied within commercial buildings.

    (c) __Expanding survey data__ 

    The Secretary of Energy, acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, shall—

        (1)

         collect, through each Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey of the Energy Information Administration that is conducted after April 30, 2015, data on—

            (A) categories of building occupancy that are known to consume significant quantities of energy, such as occupancy by data centers, trading floors, and restaurants; and

            (B) other aspects of the property, building operation, or building occupancy determined by the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to be relevant in lowering energy consumption;

        (2) with respect to the first Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey conducted after April 30, 2015, to the extent full compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) is not feasible, conduct activities to develop the capability to collect such data and begin to collect such data; and

        (3) make data collected under paragraphs (1) and (2) available to the public in aggregated form and provide such data, and any associated results, to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for use in accordance with subsection (d).

    (d) __Recognition of owners and tenants__ 

        (1) __Occupancy-based recognition__ 

        Not later than 1 year after the date on which sufficient data is received pursuant to subsection (c), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, following an opportunity for public notice and comment—

            (A) in a manner similar to the Energy Star rating system for commercial buildings, develop policies and procedures to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces;

            (B) establish building occupancy categories eligible for Tenant Star recognition based on the data collected under subsection (c) and any other appropriate data sources; and

            (C) consider other forms of recognition for commercial building tenants or other occupants that lower energy consumption in separate spaces.

        (2) __Design- and construction-based recognition__ 

            After the study required by [section 17084(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s17084/b] is completed, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary and following an opportunity for public notice and comment, may develop a voluntary program to recognize commercial building owners and tenants that use high-performance energy efficiency measures in the design and construction of separate spaces.

([Pub. L. 110–140, title IV, § 425][/us/pl/110/140/s425], as added [Pub. L. 114–11, title I, § 104(a)][/us/pl/114/11/s104/a], Apr. 30, 2015, [129 Stat. 185][/us/stat/129/185].)
