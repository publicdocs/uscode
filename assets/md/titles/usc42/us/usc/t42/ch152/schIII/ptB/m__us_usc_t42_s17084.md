## § 17084. Separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __High-performance energy efficiency measure__ 

            The term “high-performance energy efficiency measure” means a technology, product, or practice that will result in substantial operational cost savings by reducing energy consumption and utility costs.

        (2) __Separate spaces__ 

            The term “separate spaces” means areas within a commercial building that are leased or otherwise occupied by a tenant or other occupant for a period of time pursuant to the terms of a written agreement.

    (b) __Study__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 1 year after April 30, 2015, the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, shall complete a study on the feasibility of—

            (A) significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction, by owners and tenants, of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and

            (B) encouraging owners and tenants to implement high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces.

        (2) __Scope__ 

        The study shall, at a minimum, include—

            (A)

             descriptions of—

                (i) high-performance energy efficiency measures that should be considered as part of the initial design and construction of separate spaces;

                (ii) processes that owners, tenants, architects, and engineers may replicate when designing and constructing separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures;

                (iii) policies and best practices to achieve reductions in energy intensities for lighting, plug loads, heating, cooling, cooking, laundry, and other systems to satisfy the needs of the commercial building tenant;

                (iv) return on investment and payback analyses of the incremental cost and projected energy savings of the proposed set of high-performance energy efficiency measures, including consideration of available incentives;

                (v) models and simulation methods that predict the quantity of energy used by separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures and that compare that predicted quantity to the quantity of energy used by separate spaces without high-performance energy efficiency measures but that otherwise comply with applicable building code requirements;

                (vi) measurement and verification platforms demonstrating actual energy use of high-performance energy efficiency measures installed in separate spaces, and whether such measures generate the savings intended in the initial design and construction of the separate spaces;

                (vii) best practices that encourage an integrated approach to designing and constructing separate spaces to perform at optimum energy efficiency in conjunction with the central systems of a commercial building; and

                (viii) any impact on employment resulting from the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and

            (B) case studies reporting economic and energy savings returns in the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

        (3) __Public participation__ 

            Not later than 90 days after April 30, 2015, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments regarding effective methods, measures, and practices for the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

        (4) __Publication__ 

            The Secretary shall publish the study on the website of the Department of Energy.
