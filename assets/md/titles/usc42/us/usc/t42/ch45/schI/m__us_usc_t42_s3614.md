    (d) __Relief which may be granted in civil actions under subsections (a) and (b)__ 

        (1)

         In a civil action under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court—

            (A) may award such preventive relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person responsible for a violation of this subchapter as is necessary to assure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this subchapter;

            (B) may award such other relief as the court deems appropriate, including monetary damages to persons aggrieved; and

            (C)

             may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty against the respondent—

                (i) in an amount not exceeding $50,000, for a first violation; and

                (ii) in an amount not exceeding $100,000, for any subsequent violation.

        (2) In a civil action under this section, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee and costs.
