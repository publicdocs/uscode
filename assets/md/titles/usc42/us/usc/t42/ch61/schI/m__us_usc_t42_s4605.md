## § 4605. Displaced persons not eligible for assistance

    (a) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a displaced person shall not be eligible to receive relocation payments or any other assistance under this chapter if the displaced person is an alien not lawfully present in the United States.

    (b) __Determinations of eligibility__ 

        (1) __Promulgation of regulations__ 

            Not later than 1 year after November 21, 1997, after providing notice and an opportunity for public comment, the head of the lead agency shall promulgate regulations to carry out subsection (a) of this section.

        (2) __Contents of regulations__ 

        Regulations promulgated under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) prescribe the processes, procedures, and information that a displacing agency must use in determining whether a displaced person is an alien not lawfully present in the United States;

            (B) prohibit a displacing agency from discriminating against any displaced person;

            (C) ensure that each eligibility determination is fair and based on reliable information; and

            (D) prescribe standards for a displacing agency to apply in making determinations relating to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship under subsection (c) of this section.

    (c) __Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship__ 

        If a displacing agency determines by clear and convincing evidence that a determination of the ineligibility of a displaced person under subsection (a) of this section would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to an individual who is the displaced person’s spouse, parent, or child and who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, the displacing agency shall provide relocation payments and other assistance to the displaced person under this chapter if the displaced person would be eligible for the assistance but for subsection (a) of this section.

    (d) __Limitation on statutory construction__ 

        Nothing in this section affects any right available to a displaced person under any other provision of Federal or State law.
