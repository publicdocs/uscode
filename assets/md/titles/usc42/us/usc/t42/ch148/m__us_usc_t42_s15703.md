## § 15703. National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        There is established the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, the purpose of which is to achieve major measurable reductions in the losses of life and property from windstorms through a coordinated Federal effort, in cooperation with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector, aimed at improving the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and developing and encouraging the implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce those impacts.

    (b) __Responsibilities of Program agencies__ 

        (1) __Lead agency__ 

        The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall have the primary responsibility for planning and coordinating the Program. In carrying out this paragraph, the Director shall—

            (A) ensure that the Program includes the necessary components to promote the implementation of windstorm risk reduction measures by Federal, State, and local governments, national standards and model building code organizations, architects and engineers, and others with a role in planning and constructing buildings and lifelines;

            (B) support the development of performance-based engineering tools, and work with appropriate groups to promote the commercial application of such tools, including through wind-related model building codes, voluntary standards, and construction best practices;

            (C) request the assistance of Federal agencies other than the Program agencies, as necessary to assist in carrying out this chapter;

            (D) coordinate all Federal post-windstorm investigations to the extent practicable; and

            (E) when warranted by research or investigative findings, issue recommendations to assist in informing the development of model codes, and provide information to Congress on the use of such recommendations.

        (2) __National Institute of Standards and Technology__ 

            In addition to the lead agency responsibilities described under paragraph (1), the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall be responsible for carrying out research and development to improve model building codes, voluntary standards, and best practices for the design, construction, and retrofit of buildings, structures, and lifelines.

        (3) __National Science Foundation__ 

        The National Science Foundation shall support research in—

            (A) engineering and the atmospheric sciences to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines; and

            (B) economic and social factors influencing windstorm risk reduction measures.

        (4) __National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration__ 

            The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall support atmospheric sciences research to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines.

        (5) __Federal Emergency Management Agency__ 

        The Federal Emergency Management Agency shall—

            (A)

             support—

                (i) the development of risk assessment tools and effective mitigation techniques;

                (ii) windstorm-related data collection and analysis;

                (iii) public outreach and information dissemination; and

                (iv) promotion of the adoption of windstorm preparedness and mitigation measures, including for households, businesses, and communities, consistent with the Agency’s all-hazards approach; and

            (B) work closely with national standards and model building code organizations, in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to promote the implementation of research results and promote better building practices within the building design and construction industry, including architects, engineers, contractors, builders, and inspectors.

    (c) __Program components__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Program shall consist of three primary mitigation components: improved understanding of windstorms, windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact reduction. The components shall be implemented through activities such as data collection and analysis, risk assessment, outreach, technology transfer, and research and development. To the extent practicable, research activities authorized under this chapter shall be peer-reviewed, and the components shall be designed to be complementary to, and avoid duplication of, other public and private hazard reduction efforts.

        (2) __Understanding of windstorms__ 

            Activities to enhance the understanding of windstorms shall include research to improve knowledge of and data collection on the impact of severe wind on buildings, structures, and infrastructure.

        (3) __Windstorm impact assessment__ 

        Activities to improve windstorm impact assessment shall include—

            (A) development of mechanisms for collecting and inventorying information on the performance of buildings, structures, and infrastructure in windstorms and improved collection of pertinent information from sources, including the design and construction industry, insurance companies, and building officials;

            (B) research, development, and technology transfer to improve loss estimation and risk assessment systems; and

            (C) research, development, and technology transfer to improve simulation and computational modeling of windstorm impacts.

        (4) __Windstorm impact reduction__ 

        Activities to reduce windstorm impacts shall include—

            (A) development of improved outreach and implementation mechanisms to translate existing information and research findings into cost-effective and affordable practices for design and construction professionals, and State and local officials;

            (B) development of cost-effective and affordable windstorm-resistant systems, structures, and materials for use in new construction and retrofit of existing construction; and

            (C) outreach and information dissemination related to cost-effective and affordable construction techniques, loss estimation and risk assessment methodologies, and other pertinent information regarding windstorm phenomena to Federal, State, and local officials, the construction industry, and the general public.

    (d) __Budget activities__ 

        The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall each include in their agency’s annual budget request to Congress a description of their agency’s projected activities under the Program for the fiscal year covered by the budget request, along with an assessment of what they plan to spend on those activities for that fiscal year.

    (e) __Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            There is established an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, chaired by the Director or the Director’s designee.

        (2) __Membership__ 

        In addition to the chair, the Committee shall be composed of—

            (A)
