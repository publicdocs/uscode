## § 8821. Termination of authorities; modification of terms and conditions of conditional commitments for loan guarantees

    No insured loan, loan guarantee, price guarantee, or purchase agreement may be committed to or made under this subchapter after September 30, 1984, except that all conditional commitments for loan guarantees under this subchapter which were in existence on September 30, 1984, are hereby extended through June 30, 1987. This section shall not be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary concerned to spend funds after such date pursuant to any contract for financial assistance made on or before that date under this subchapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary of Energy may modify the terms and conditions of any conditional commitment for a loan guarantee under this subchapter made before October 1, 1984, including the amount of the loan guarantee. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as indicating Congressional approval with respect to any pending conditional commitments under this Act.
