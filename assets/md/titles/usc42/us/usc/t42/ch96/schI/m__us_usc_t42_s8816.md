## § 8816. Purchase agreements

    (a) __Authority of Secretary concerned; consultative requirements__ 

    Subject to sections 8812 and 8817 of this title, the Secretary concerned may commit to make, and make, purchase agreements for all or part of the biomass energy production of any biomass energy project, if the Secretary determines—

        (1) that such biomass energy is of a type, quantity, and quality that can be used by Federal agencies; and

        (2) that the quantity of such biomass energy, if delivery is accepted, would not exceed the likely needs of Federal agencies.

        Each Secretary concerned shall consult with the other Secretary before making any determination under paragraph (2).

    (b) __Maximum sales price__ 

        The sales price specified in a purchase agreement under this section may not exceed the estimated prevailing market price as of the date of delivery, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, unless the Secretary concerned determines that such sales price must exceed the estimated prevailing market price in order to ensure the production of biomass energy to achieve the purposes of this chapter.

    (c) __Assurances required__ 

    The Secretary concerned in entering into, or committing to enter into, a purchase agreement under this section shall require—

        (1) assurances that the quality of the biomass energy purchased will meet standards for the use for which such energy is purchased;

        (2) assurances that the ordered quantities of such energy will be delivered on a timely basis; and

        (3) such other assurances as may reasonably be required.

    (d) __Arrangements for delivery pursuant to agreement; charge to Federal agency receiving delivery__ 

        The Secretary concerned may take delivery of biomass energy pursuant to a purchase agreement under this section if appropriate arrangements have been made for its distribution to and use by one or more Federal agencies. Any Federal agency receiving such energy shall be charged (in accordance with otherwise applicable law), from sums appropriated to such Federal agency, for the prevailing market price as of the date of delivery, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, for the product which the biomass energy is replacing.

    (e) __Consultative requirements__ 

        The Secretary concerned shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the General Services Administration in carrying out this section.

    (f) __Terms and conditions__ 

        Each purchase agreement, and commitment to enter into a purchase agreement, under this section shall provide that the Secretary concerned retains the right to refuse delivery of the biomass energy involved upon such terms and conditions as shall be specified in the purchase agreement.

    (g) __Maximum dollar amount of liability of United States__ 

        Each purchase agreement, or commitment to enter into a purchase agreement, which is made under this section shall specify the maximum dollar amount of liability of the United States under that agreement.

    (h) __Renegotiation of sales price and maximum liability__ 

    If the Secretary concerned determines, in the discretion of the Secretary, that—

        (1) a biomass energy project would not otherwise be satisfactorily completed or continued, and

        (2) completion or continuation of such project would be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter,

        the sales price set forth in the purchase agreement, and maximum liability under such agreement, may be renegotiated.
