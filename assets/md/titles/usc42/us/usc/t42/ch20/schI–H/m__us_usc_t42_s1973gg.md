## § 1973gg. Findings and purposes

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds that—

        (1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right;

        (2) it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right; and

        (3) discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities.

    (b) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this subchapter are—

        (1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office;

        (2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this subchapter in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office;

        (3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and

        (4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.
