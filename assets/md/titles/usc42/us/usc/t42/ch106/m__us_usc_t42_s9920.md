## § 9920. Operational rule

    (a) __Religious organizations included as nongovernmental providers__ 

        For any program carried out by the Federal Government, or by a State or local government under this chapter, the government shall consider, on the same basis as other nongovernmental organizations, religious organizations to provide the assistance under the program, so long as the program is implemented in a manner consistent with the Establishment Clause of the first amendment to the Constitution. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under this chapter shall discriminate against an organization that provides assistance under, or applies to provide assistance under, this chapter, on the basis that the organization has a religious character.

    (b) __Religious character and independence__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A religious organization that provides assistance under a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall retain its religious character and control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.

        (2) __Additional safeguards__ 

        Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government shall require a religious organization—

            (A) to alter its form of internal governance, except (for purposes of administration of the community services block grant program) as provided in [section 9910 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s9910]; or

            (B) to remove religious art, icons, scripture, or other symbols;

            in order to be eligible to provide assistance under a program described in subsection (a) of this section.

        (3) __Employment practices__ 

            A religious organization’s exemption provided under [section 2000e–1 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s2000e–1] regarding employment practices shall not be affected by its participation in, or receipt of funds from, programs described in subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Limitations on use of funds for certain purposes__ 

        No funds provided directly to a religious organization to provide assistance under any program described in subsection (a) of this section shall be expended for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.

    (d) __Fiscal accountability__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), any religious organization providing assistance under any program described in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations to account in accord with generally accepted accounting principles for the use of such funds provided under such program.

        (2) __Limited audit__ 

            Such organization shall segregate government funds provided under such program into a separate account. Only the government funds shall be subject to audit by the government.

    (e) __Treatment of eligible entities and other intermediate organizations__ 

        If an eligible entity or other organization (referred to in this subsection as an “intermediate organization”), acting under a contract, or grant or other agreement, with the Federal Government or a State or local government, is given the authority under the contract or agreement to select nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance under the programs described in subsection (a) of this section, the intermediate organization shall have the same duties under this section as the government.
