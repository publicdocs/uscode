## § 15483. Computerized statewide voter registration list requirements and requirements for voters who register by mail

    (a) __Computerized statewide voter registration list requirements__ 

        (1) __Implementation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each State, acting through the chief State election official, shall implement, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, a single, uniform, official, centralized, interactive computerized statewide voter registration list defined, maintained, and administered at the State level that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the State and assigns a unique identifier to each legally registered voter in the State (in this subsection referred to as the “computerized list”), and includes the following:

                (i) The computerized list shall serve as the single system for storing and managing the official list of registered voters throughout the State.

                (ii) The computerized list contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the State.

                (iii) Under the computerized list, a unique identifier is assigned to each legally registered voter in the State.

                (iv) The computerized list shall be coordinated with other agency databases within the State.

                (v) Any election official in the State, including any local election official, may obtain immediate electronic access to the information contained in the computerized list.

                (vi) All voter registration information obtained by any local election official in the State shall be electronically entered into the computerized list on an expedited basis at the time the information is provided to the local official.

                (vii) The chief State election official shall provide such support as may be required so that local election officials are able to enter information as described in clause (vi).

                (viii) The computerized list shall serve as the official voter registration list for the conduct of all elections for Federal office in the State.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                The requirement under subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a State in which, under a State law in effect continuously on and after October 29, 2002, there is no voter registration requirement for individuals in the State with respect to elections for Federal office.

        (2) __Computerized list maintenance__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The appropriate State or local election official shall perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis as follows:

                (i) If an individual is to be removed from the computerized list, such individual shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg] et seq.), including subsections (a)(4), (c)(2), (d), and (e) of section 8 of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg–6][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg–6]).

                (ii)

                 For purposes of removing names of ineligible voters from the official list of eligible voters—

                    (I) under section 8(a)(3)(B) of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg–6(a)(3)(B)][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg–6/a/3/B]), the State shall coordinate the computerized list with State agency records on felony status; and

                    (II) by reason of the death of the registrant under section 8(a)(4)(A) of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg–6(a)(4)(A)][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg–6/a/4/A]), the State shall coordinate the computerized list with State agency records on death.

                (iii) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subparagraph, if a State is described in section 4(b) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg–2(b)][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg–2/b]), that State shall remove the names of ineligible voters from the computerized list in accordance with State law.

            (B) __Conduct__ 

            The list maintenance performed under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted in a manner that ensures that—

                (i) the name of each registered voter appears in the computerized list;

                (ii) only voters who are not registered or who are not eligible to vote are removed from the computerized list; and

                (iii) duplicate names are eliminated from the computerized list.

        (3) __Technological security of computerized list__ 

            The appropriate State or local official shall provide adequate technological security measures to prevent the unauthorized access to the computerized list established under this section.

        (4) __Minimum standard for accuracy of State voter registration records__ 

        The State election system shall include provisions to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are updated regularly, including the following:

            (A) A system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters. Under such system, consistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ([42 U.S.C. 1973gg][/us/usc/t42/s1973gg] et seq.), registrants who have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in 2 consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed from the official list of eligible voters, except that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to vote.

            (B) Safeguards to ensure that eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible voters.

        (5) __Verification of voter registration information__ 

            (A) __Requiring provision of certain information by applicants__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in clause (ii), notwithstanding any other provision of law, an application for voter registration for an election for Federal office may not be accepted or processed by a State unless the application includes—

                    (I) in the case of an applicant who has been issued a current and valid driver’s license, the applicant’s driver’s license number; or

                    (II) in the case of any other applicant (other than an applicant to whom clause (ii) applies), the last 4 digits of the applicant’s social security number.

                (ii) __Special rule for applicants without driver’s license or social security number__ 

                    If an applicant for voter registration for an election for Federal office has not been issued a current and valid driver’s license or a social security number, the State shall assign the applicant a number which will serve to identify the applicant for voter registration purposes. To the extent that the State has a computerized list in effect under this subsection and the list assigns unique identifying numbers to registrants, the number assigned under this clause shall be the unique identifying number assigned under the list.

                (iii) __Determination of validity of numbers provided__ 

                    The State shall determine whether the information provided by an individual is sufficient to meet the requirements of this subparagraph, in accordance with State law.

            (B) __Requirements for State officials__ 

                (i) __Sharing information in databases__ 

                    The chief State election official and the official responsible for the State motor vehicle authority of a State shall enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.

                (ii) __Agreements with Commissioner of Social Security__ 

                    The official responsible for the State motor vehicle authority shall enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security under [section 405(r)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s405/r/8] (as added by subparagraph (C)).

            (C) __Omitted__ 

            (D) __Special rule for certain States__ 

                In the case of a State which is permitted to use social security numbers, and provides for the use of social security numbers, on applications for voter registration, in accordance with section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 ([5 U.S.C. 552a][/us/usc/t5/s552a] note), the provisions of this paragraph shall be optional.
