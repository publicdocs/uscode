## § 9125. Judicial review

    Any person suffering legal wrong, or who is adversely affected or aggrieved by the Administrator’s decision to issue, transfer, modify, renew, suspend, or terminate a license may, not later than 60 days after such decision is made, seek judicial review of such decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A person shall be deemed to be aggrieved by the Administrator’s decision within the meaning of this chapter if he—

    (1) has participated in the administrative proceedings before the Administrator (or if he did not so participate, he can show that his failure to do so was caused by the Administrator’s failure to provide the required notice); and

    (2) is adversely affected by the Administrator’s action.
