    (3) __Repayment of grant funds__ 

    If an entity is awarded grant funds under this subchapter during the 2-fiscal-year period in which the entity is barred from receiving grants under paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall—

        (B) seek to recoup the costs of the repayment to the fund from the grant recipient that was erroneously awarded grant funds.

    (4) __Defined term__ 

        In this section, the term “unresolved audit finding” means an audit report finding in the final report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice that the grantee has utilized grant funds for an unauthorized expenditure or otherwise unallowable cost that is not closed or resolved within a 12-month period beginning on the date when the final audit report is issued.
