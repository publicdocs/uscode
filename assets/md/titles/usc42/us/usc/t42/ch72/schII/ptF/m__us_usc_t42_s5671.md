## § 5671. Authorization of appropriations

    (a) __Authorization of appropriations for this subchapter (excluding parts C and E)__ 

        (1) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subchapter such sums as may be appropriate for fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.

        (2)

         Of such sums as are appropriated for a fiscal year to carry out this subchapter (other than parts C and E)—

            (A) not more than 5 percent shall be available to carry out part A;

            (B) not less than 80 percent shall be available to carry out part B; and

            (C) not more than 15 percent shall be available to carry out part D.

    (b) __Authorization of appropriations for part C__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out part C such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.

    (c) __Authorization of appropriations for part E__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out part E, and authorized to remain available until expended, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.

    (d) __Experimentation on individuals; prohibition; “behavior control” defined__ 

        No funds appropriated to carry out the purposes of this subchapter may be used for any bio-medical or behavior control experimentation on individuals or any research involving such experimentation. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “behavior control” refers to experimentation or research employing methods which involve a substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to the individual subject and which are intended to modify or alter criminal and other anti-social behavior, including aversive conditioning therapy, drug therapy or chemotherapy (except as part of routine clinical care), physical therapy of mental disorders, electroconvulsive therapy, or physical punishment. The term does not apply to a limited class of programs generally recognized as involving no such risk, including methadone maintenance and certain alcohol treatment programs, psychological counseling, parent training, behavior contracting, survival skills training, restitution, or community service, if safeguards are established for the informed consent of subjects (including parents or guardians of minors).
