 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior [section 382 of Pub. L. 93–415][/us/pl/93/415/s382] was renumbered section 383 and is classified to [section 5716 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s5716].

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—[Pub. L. 106–71][/us/pl/106/71] amended section generally, making reporting requirements biennial rather than annual and adding subsec. headings.

    1992—[Pub.

(b), was executed to this section, which is section 381 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 ([Pub. L. 93–415][/us/pl/93/415]), to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the intervening renumbering of [section 361 of Pub. L. 93–415][/us/pl/93/415/s361] as section 381 by [section 3(g)(1)(A)(ii) of Pub. L. 102–586][/us/pl/102/586/s3/g/1/A/ii]. Prior to amendment, this section consisted of subsecs. (a) and (b) which required annual reports to Congress on the status and accomplishments of the runaway and homeless youth centers funded under part A of this subchapter and of the transitional living youth projects funded under part B of this subchapter.

    1989—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 101–204][/us/pl/101/204], § 1003(1), substituted “submit a report to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate” for “report to the Congress”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 101–204][/us/pl/101/204], § 1003(2), substituted “Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate” for “The Secretary shall annually report to the Congress”.

    1988—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690], §§ 7271(c)(5), 7273(c)(1), (2), 7274, designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), in introductory provisions substituted “Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall” for “The Secretary shall annually”, “runaway and homeless youth centers” for “runaway centers”, and “part A of this subchapter” for “this part”, and in par. (1) substituted “runaway and homeless youth” for “runaway youth”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690], § 7273(c)(3), added subsec. (b).

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–509][/us/pl/96/509] substituted “centers” for “houses”.

 __Effective Date of 1988 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] effective Oct. 1, 1988, with the report required by this section with respect to fiscal year 1988 to be submitted not later than Aug. 1, 1989, notwithstanding the 180-day period provided in this section, see section 7296(a), (b)(3) of [Pub.
