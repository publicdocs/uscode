## § 14053. Violent crime and drug emergency areas

    (a) __Definitions__ 

        In this section—

        “major violent crime or drug-related emergency” means an occasion or instance in which violent crime, drug smuggling, drug trafficking, or drug abuse violence reaches such levels, as determined by the President, that Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives, and to protect property and public health and safety.

        “State” means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

    (b) __Declaration of violent crime and drug emergency areas__ 

        If a major violent crime or drug-related emergency exists throughout a State or a part of a State, the President may declare the State or part of a State to be a violent crime or drug emergency area and may take appropriate actions authorized by this section.

    (c) __Procedure__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A request for a declaration designating an area to be a violent crime or drug emergency area shall be made, in writing, by the chief executive officer of a State or local government, respectively (or in the case of the District of Columbia, the mayor), and shall be forwarded to the Attorney General in such form as the Attorney General may by regulation require. One or more cities, counties, States, or the District of Columbia may submit a joint request for designation as a major violent crime or drug emergency area under this subsection.

        (2) __Finding__ 

            A request made under paragraph (1) shall be based on a written finding that the major violent crime or drug-related emergency is of such severity and magnitude that Federal assistance is necessary to ensure an effective response to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety.

    (d) __Irrelevancy of population density__ 

        The President shall not limit declarations made under this section to highly populated centers of violent crime or drug trafficking, drug smuggling, or drug use, but shall also consider applications from governments of less populated areas where the magnitude and severity of such activities is beyond the capability of the State or local government to respond.

    (e) __Requirements__ 

    As part of a request for a declaration under this section, and as a prerequisite to Federal violent crime or drug emergency assistance under this section, the chief executive officer of a State or local government shall—

        (1) take appropriate action under State or local law and furnish information on the nature and amount of State and local resources that have been or will be committed to alleviating the major violent crime- or drug-related emergency;

        (2) submit a detailed plan outlining that government’s short- and long-term plans to respond to the violent crime or drug emergency, specifying the types and levels of Federal assistance requested and including explicit goals (including quantitative goals) and timetables; and

        (3) specify how Federal assistance provided under this section is intended to achieve those goals.

    (f) __Review period__ 

        The Attorney General shall review a request submitted pursuant to this section, and the President shall decide whether to declare a violent crime or drug emergency area, within 30 days after receiving the request.

    (g) __Federal assistance__ 

    The President may—

        (1) direct any Federal agency, with or without reimbursement, to utilize its authorities and the resources granted to it under Federal law (including personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, financial assistance, and managerial, technical, and advisory services) in support of State and local assistance efforts; and

        (2) provide technical and advisory assistance, including communications support and law enforcement-related intelligence information.

    (h) __Duration of Federal assistance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Federal assistance under this section shall not be provided to a violent crime or drug emergency area for more than 1 year.

        (2) __Extension__ 

            The chief executive officer of a jurisdiction may apply to the President for an extension of assistance beyond 1 year. The President may extend the provision of Federal assistance for not more than an additional 180 days.

    (i) __Regulations__ 

        Not later than 120 days after September 13, 1994, the Attorney General shall issue regulations to implement this section.

    (j) __No effect on existing authority__ 

        Nothing in this section shall diminish or detract from existing authority possessed by the President or Attorney General.
