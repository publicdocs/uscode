    (b) __Definitions__ 

    Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in this section:

        (1) __Dangerous sexual offense__

        (2) __Murder__ 

            The term “murder” has the meaning given the term in part I of the Uniform Crime Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

        (3) __Rape__ 

            The term “rape” has the meaning given the term in part I of the Uniform Crime Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

    (c) __Penalty__ 

        (1) __Single State__ 

            Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in any case in which a criminal-records-reporting State convicts an individual of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual offense, who has a prior conviction for any one of those offenses in a State described in paragraph (3), it may, under subsection (d) of this section, apply to the Attorney General for $10,000, for its related apprehension and prosecution costs, and $22,500 per year (up to a maximum of 5 years), for its related incarceration costs with both amounts for costs adjusted annually for the rate of inflation.

        (2) __Multiple States__ 

            Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in any case in which a criminal-records-reporting State convicts an individual of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual offense, who has a prior conviction for any one or more of those offenses in more than one other State described in paragraph (3), it may, under subsection (d) of this section, apply to the Attorney General for $10,000, for its related apprehension and prosecution costs, and $22,500 per year (up to a maximum of 5 years), for its related incarceration costs with both amounts for costs adjusted annually for the rate of inflation.

        (3) __State described__ 

        Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, a State is described in this paragraph unless—

            (A) the term of imprisonment imposed by the State on the individual described in paragraph (1) or (2), as applicable, was not less than the average term of imprisonment imposed for that offense in all States; or

            (B) with respect to the individual described in paragraph (1) or (2), as applicable, the individual had served not less than 85 percent of the term of imprisonment to which that individual was sentenced for the prior offense.

            For purposes of subparagraph (B), in a State that has indeterminate sentencing, the term of imprisonment to which that individual was sentenced for the prior offense shall be based on the lower of the range of sentences.

    (d) __State applications__

    (e) __Source of funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, any amount under subsection (c) of this section shall be derived by reducing the amount of Federal law enforcement assistance funds received by the State pursuant to [section 3755 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3755] that convicted such individual of the prior offense before the distribution of the funds to the State.

 __Codification__ 

    January 5, 2006, referred to in subsec. (i)(2)(A), was in the original “the date of enactment of this Act”, which was translated as meaning the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], which enacted subsec. (i)(2) of this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Section was enacted as Aimee’s Law and also as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, and not as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which enacted this chapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(1), substituted “Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in this section” for “In this section” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(1), (2), substituted “Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in any case” for “In any case”, “a criminal-records-reporting State” for “a State” the first place appearing, and “(3), it may, under subsection (d) of this section, apply to the Attorney General for $10,000, for its related apprehension and prosecution costs, and $22,500 per year (up to a maximum of 5 years), for its related incarceration costs with both amounts for costs adjusted annually for the rate of inflation” for “(3), the Attorney General shall transfer an amount equal to the costs of incarceration, prosecution, and apprehension of that individual, from Federal law enforcement assistance funds that have been allocated to but not distributed to the State that convicted the individual of the prior offense, to the State account that collects Federal law enforcement assistance funds of the State that convicted that individual of the subsequent offense”.

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(1), (2), substituted “Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in any case” for “In any case”, “a criminal-records-reporting State” for “a State”, and “(3), it may, under subsection (d) of this section, apply to the Attorney General for $10,000, for its related apprehension and prosecution costs, and $22,500 per year (up to a maximum of 5 years), for its related incarceration costs with both amounts for costs adjusted annually for the rate of inflation” for “(3), the Attorney General shall transfer an amount equal to the costs of incarceration, prosecution, and apprehension of that individual, from Federal law enforcement assistance funds that have been allocated to but not distributed to each State that convicted such individual of the prior offense, to the State account that collects Federal law enforcement assistance funds of the State that convicted that individual of the subsequent offense”.

    [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(3)(B)(ii), which directed amendment of par. (3) by striking “individuals convicted of the offense for which,” was executed by striking “individuals convicted of the offense for which” after “imposed by the State on” to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because there was no comma after “which”.

    [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(3)(B)(i), which directed that “average” be struck out, was executed by striking out “average” the first place appearing, after “(A) the”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(1), (4), (5), substituted “Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, any amount” for “Any amount transferred”, inserted “pursuant to [section 3756 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3756]” before “that convicted”, inserted “No amount described under this section shall be subject to section 3335(b) or 6503(d) of title 31” at end, and struck out former last sentence which read as follows: “The Attorney General shall provide the State with an opportunity to select the specific Federal law enforcement assistance funds to be so reduced (other than Federal crime victim assistance funds).”

    Subsec. (g). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(1), substituted “Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, this section does not apply” for “This section does not apply”.

    Subsec. (i)(1). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(6), substituted “State (where practicable)” for “State” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (i)(2). [Pub. L. 109–162][/us/pl/109/162], § 1170(7), added par. (2) and struck out heading and text of former par. (2). Text read as follows: “Not later than March 1, 2003, and on March 1 of each year thereafter, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report, which shall include—
