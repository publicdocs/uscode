([Pub. L. 103–322, title XX, § 200204][/us/pl/103/322/s200204], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2058][/us/stat/108/2058].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 14116 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s14116], referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original “section 200203”, and was translated as reading “section 200207”, meaning [section 200207 of Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322/s200207], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [section 200203 of Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322/s200203], which is classified to [section 14112 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s14112], does not provide for submission of applications, and section 14116 does so provide.
