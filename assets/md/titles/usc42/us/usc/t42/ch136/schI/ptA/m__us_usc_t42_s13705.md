## § 13705. Special rules

    (a) __Sharing of funds with counties and other units of local government__

            Each State shall reserve not more than 15 percent of the amount of funds allocated in a fiscal year pursuant to [section 13706 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s13706] for counties and units of local government to construct, develop, expand, modify, or improve jails and other correctional facilities.

        (2) __Factors for determination of amount__ 

            To determine the amount of funds to be reserved under this subsection, a State shall consider the burden placed on a county or unit of local government that results from the implementation of policies adopted by the State to carry out section 13703 or 13704 of this title.

    (b) __Use of truth-in-sentencing and violent offender incarceration grants__ 

    Funds provided under section 13703 or 13704 of this title may be applied to the cost of—

        (1) altering existing correctional facilities to provide separate facilities for juveniles under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court who are detained or are serving sentences in adult prisons or jails;

        (2) providing correctional staff who are responsible for supervising juveniles who are detained or serving sentences under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court with orientation and ongoing training regarding the unique needs of such offenders; and

        (3) providing ombudsmen to monitor the treatment of juveniles who are detained or serving sentences under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court in adult facilities, consistent with guidelines issued by the Assistant Attorney General.

    (c) __Funds for juvenile offenders__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if a State, or unit of local government located in a State that otherwise meets the requirements of section 13703 or 13704 of this title, certifies to the Attorney General that exigent circumstances exist that require the State to expend funds to build or expand facilities to confine juvenile offenders other than juvenile offenders adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would be a part 1 violent crime, the State may use funds received under this part to build or expand juvenile correctional facilities or pretrial detention facilities for juvenile offenders.
