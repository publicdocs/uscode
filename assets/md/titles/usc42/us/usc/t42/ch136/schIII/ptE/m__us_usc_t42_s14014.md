## § 14014. Report on confidentiality of addresses for victims of domestic violence

    (a) __Report__

Based on the study, the Attorney General shall transmit a report to Congress including—

        (1) the findings of the study concerning the means by which information concerning the addresses or locations of abused spouses may be obtained by abusers; and

        (2) analysis of the feasibility of creating effective means of protecting the confidentiality of information concerning the addresses and locations of abused spouses to protect such persons from exposure to further abuse while preserving access to such information for legitimate purposes.

    (b) __Use of components__ 

        The Attorney General may use the National Institute of Justice and the Office for Victims of Crime in carrying out this section.
