    (a) __Purpose__ 

    It is the purpose of this section to assist eligible grantees in responding appropriately to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking so that the status of being a victim of such a crime is not a reason for the denial or loss of housing.

        (2) development and implementation of appropriate housing policies and practices;

        (3) enhancement of collaboration with victim service providers and tenant organizations; and

    (b) __Grants authorized__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Attorney General, acting through the Director of the Violence Against Women Office of the Department of Justice (“Director”), and in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (“Secretary”), and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (“ACYF”), shall award grants and contracts for not less than 2 years to eligible grantees to promote the full and equal access to and use of housing by adult and youth victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

        (2) __Submission required for all grantees__ 

        To receive assistance under this section, an eligible grantee shall certify that—

            (A) its policies and practices do not prohibit or limit a resident’s right to summon police or other emergency assistance in response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;

            (B) programs and services are developed that give a preference in admission to adult and youth victims of such violence, consistent with local housing needs, and applicable law and the Secretary’s instructions;

    (e) __Certification__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A public housing agency, tribally designated housing entity, or assisted housing provider receiving funds under this section may request that an individual claiming relief under this section certify that the individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

            (A) providing the public housing agency, tribally designated housing entity, or assisted housing provider with documentation, signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, an attorney, a member of the clergy, a medical professional, or any other professional from whom the victim has sought assistance in addressing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse; or
