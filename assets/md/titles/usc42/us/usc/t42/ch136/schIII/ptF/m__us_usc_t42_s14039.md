([Pub. L. 103–322, title IV, § 40610][/us/pl/103/322/s40610], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 1952][/us/stat/108/1952]; [Pub. L. 109–162, § 3(b)(1)][/us/pl/109/162/s3/b/1], title XI, § 1135(a), Jan. 5, 2006, [119 Stat. 2971][/us/stat/119/2971], 3108; [Pub.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–162, § 1135(a)][/us/pl/109/162/s1135/a], which directed an amendment substantially identical to that directed by [Pub. L. 109–162, § 3(b)(1)][/us/pl/109/162/s3/b/1], was repealed by [Pub. L. 109–271][/us/pl/109/271].

    [Pub. L. 109–162, § 3(b)(1)][/us/pl/109/162/s3/b/1], which directed the substitution of “Each even-numbered fiscal year, the Attorney General shall submit to the Congress a biennial report that provides” for “The Attorney General shall submit to the Congress an annual report, beginning 1 year after September 13, 1994, that provides”, was executed by making the substitution for “The Attorney General shall submit to the Congress an annual report, beginning one year after September 13, 1994, that provides”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
