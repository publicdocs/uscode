#### Part N—National Resource Center

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 109–162, title VII, § 701][/us/pl/109/162/s701], Jan. 5, 2006, [119 Stat. 3052][/us/stat/119/3052], which directed that subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (part M of this subchapter) be amended by adding at the end a subtitle O consisting of section 41501 ([42 U.S.C. 14043f][/us/usc/t42/s14043f]), is reflected in the Code by setting out subtitle O as a separate part N (this part) and not as included in part M, as the probable intent of Congress.
