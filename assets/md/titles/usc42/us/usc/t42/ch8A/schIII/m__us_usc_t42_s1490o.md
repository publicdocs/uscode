## § 1490o. Reciprocity in approval of housing subdivisions among Federal agencies

    (a) __Administrative approval of housing subdivisions__ 

        The Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall each accept an administrative approval of any housing subdivision made by any of the others so that not later than January 1, 1984, there is total reciprocity for housing subdivision approvals among the agencies which they head.

    (b) __Certificates of reasonable value for one or more properties as constituting administrative approval of subdivision__ 

        For purposes of complying with subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall consider the issuance by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of a certificate of reasonable value for 1 or more properties in a subdivision to be an administrative approval for the entire subdivision. This subsection shall not apply after September 30, 1994.

    (c) __Report to Congress__ 

        Before the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall report to the Congress on housing subdivision approval policies and practices, if any, of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The report shall focus on the administration of environmental laws in connection with any such policies and practices, and shall recommend any statutory, regulatory, and administrative changes needed to achieve total reciprocity for such housing subdivision approvals. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall consult with the foregoing agencies, and such other agencies as the Secretary selects, in preparing the report.

    (d) __Approval by local, county, or State agencies__ 

        For loans made under this subchapter, the Secretary may accept subdivisions that have been approved by local, county, or State agencies.
