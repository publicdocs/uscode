## § 1486. Financial assistance to provide low-rent housing for domestic farm labor

    (a) __Application; considerations__ 

    Upon the application of any State or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe, or any broad-based public or private nonprofit organization incorporated within the State, or any nonprofit organization of farmworkers incorporated within the State, the Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance for the provision of low-rent housing and related facilities (which may be located any place within the State) for domestic farm labor, if he finds that—

        (1) the housing and related facilities for which financial assistance is requested will fulfill a pressing need in the area in which such housing and facilities will be located, and there is reasonable doubt that the same can be provided without financial assistance under this section;

        (2) the applicant will contribute, from its own resources or from funds borrowed under [section 1484 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1484] or elsewhere, at least 10 per centum of the total development cost;

        (3) the types of housing and related facilities to be provided are most practicable, giving due consideration to the purposes to be served thereby and the needs of the occupants thereof, and such housing and facilities shall be durable and suitable for year-around occupancy or use, unless the Secretary finds that there is no need for such year-around occupancy or use in that area; and

        (4) the construction will be undertaken in an economical manner, and the housing and related facilities will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or material.

    (b) __Maximum amount of assistance__ 

        The amount of any financial assistance provided under this section for low-rent housing and related facilities shall not exceed 90 per centum of the total development cost thereof, as determined by the Secretary, less such amount as the Secretary determines can be practicably obtained from other sources (including a loan under [section 1484 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1484]).

    (c) __Prerequisite agreements; rentals; safety and sanitation standards; priority of domestic farm labor__ 

    No financial assistance for low-rent housing and related facilities shall be made available under this section unless, to any extent and for any periods required by the Secretary, the applicant agrees—

        (1) that the rentals charged domestic farm labor shall not exceed such amounts as may be approved by the Secretary, giving due consideration to the income and earning capacity of the tenants, and the necessary costs of operating and maintaining such housing;

        (2) that such housing shall be maintained at all times in a safe and sanitary condition in accordance with such standards as may be prescribed by State or local law, or, in the absence of such standards, in accordance with such minimum requirements as the Secretary shall prescribe; and

        (3) an absolute priority will be given at all times in granting occupancy of such housing and facilities to domestic farm labor.

    (d) __Payments; contracts to specify uses of housing__ 

        The Secretary may make payments pursuant to any contract for financial assistance under this section at such times and in such manner, as may be specified in the contract. In each contract, the Secretary shall include such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he deems necessary to insure that the housing and related facilities, for which financial assistance is made available, be used only in conformity with the provisions of this section.

    (e) __Regulations for prevention of waste__ 

        The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to insure that Federal funds expended under this section are not wasted or dissipated. The Secretary shall not give priority for funding under this section to any one of the groups listed in subsection (a) of this section over any of the others so listed.

    (f) __Wages; labor standards; waiver; authority and functions of Secretary__ 

        All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects assisted by the Secretary which are undertaken by approved applicants under this section shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40. The Secretary shall not extend any financial assistance under this section for any project without first obtaining adequate assurance that these labor standards will be maintained on the construction work; except that compliance with such standards may be waived by the Secretary in cases or classes of cases where laborers or mechanics, not otherwise employed at any time on the project, voluntarily donate their services without compensation for the purpose of lowering the costs of construction and the Secretary determines that any amounts thereby saved are fully credited to the person, corporation, association, organization, or other entity, undertaking the project. The Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the labor standards specified in this section, the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (15 F.R. 3176; [64 Stat. 1267][/us/stat/64/1267]), and [section 3145 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s3145].

    As used in this section—

        (1) the term “low-rent housing” means rental housing within the financial reach of families of low income consisting of (A) new structures (including household furnishings) suitable for dwelling use by domestic farm labor, and (B) existing structures (including household furnishings) which can be made suitable for dwelling use by domestic farm labor by rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, or improvement;

        (2) the terms “related facilities” and “domestic farm labor” shall have the meaning assigned to them in [section 1484(f) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1484/f];

    (h) __Migrant farmworker housing__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary may, upon a finding of persistent need for migrant farmworker housing in any area, provide assistance to eligible applicants for 90 per centum of the development costs of such housing in such area to be used solely by migrant farmworkers while they are away from their residence. Such housing shall be constructed in such a manner as to be safe and weatherproof for the time it is to be occupied, be equipped with potable water and modern sanitation facilities (including a kitchen sink, toilet, and bathing facilities), and meet such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe.

    (i) __Farm labor housing__

    Housing and related facilities constructed with grants under this section may be used for tenants eligible for occupancy under [section 1485 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1485] if the Secretary determines that—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may provide the following assistance for housing under this subsection:

                (i) An advance, in an amount not to exceed $400,000, of the cost of acquisition, substantial rehabilitation, or acquisition and rehabilitation of an existing structure or construction of a new structure for use in the provision of housing under this subsection.

                (ii) A grant, in an amount not to exceed $400,000, for moderate rehabilitation of an existing structure for use in the provision of housing under this subsection.

Recipients shall be required to repay 100 percent of the advance if the housing is used for purposes under this subsection for fewer than 10 years following initial occupancy. If the housing is used for such purposes for more than 10 years, the percentage of the amount that shall be required to be repaid shall be reduced by 10 percentage points for each year in excess of 10 that the property is so used.

            (D) __Prevention of undue benefits__
