        (3) __Evaluation criteria for economic development districts__ 

            The criteria for evaluation of an economic development district shall, at a minimum, provide for an assessment of management standards, financial accountability, and program performance.

    (e) __Peer review__ 

        In conducting an evaluation of a university center or economic development district under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide for the participation of at least 1 other university center or economic development district, as appropriate, on a cost-reimbursement basis.
