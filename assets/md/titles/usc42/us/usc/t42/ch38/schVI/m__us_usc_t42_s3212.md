 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 3222 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3222] prior to renumbering by [Pub. L. 105–393][/us/pl/105/393].

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 3212, [Pub. L. 89–136, title VII][/us/pl/89/136/tVII], § 702, Aug. 26, 1965, [79 Stat. 572][/us/stat/79/572], related to prevention of unfair competition, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 105–393][/us/pl/105/393], § 102(b)(3).

    A prior [section 602 of Pub. L. 89–136][/us/pl/89/136/s602] was classified to [section 3202 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3202] prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 105–393][/us/pl/105/393], § 102(a).

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–373][/us/pl/108/373] substituted “in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40” for “in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended ([40 U.S.C. 276a–276a][/us/usc/t40/s276a–276a]–5)” in first sentence and “[section 3145 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s3145]” for “[section 2 of the Act of June 13, 1934][/us/act/1934-06-13/s2], as amended ([40 U.S.C. 276c][/us/usc/t40/s276c])” in third sentence.

    1998—[Pub. L. 105–393][/us/pl/105/393], § 102(b)(2)(A), substituted section catchline for former section catchline.

    [Pub.
