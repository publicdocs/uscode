## § 3145. Supplementary grants

    (a) __Definition of designated Federal grant program__ 

    In this section, the term “designated Federal grant program” means any Federal grant program that—

        (1) provides assistance in the construction or equipping of public works, public service, or development facilities;

        (2) the Secretary designates as eligible for an allocation of funds under this section; and

        (3)

         assists projects that are—

            (A) eligible for assistance under this subchapter; and

            (B) consistent with a comprehensive economic development strategy.

    (b) __Supplementary grants__ 

        Subject to subsection (c) of this section, in order to assist eligible recipients in taking advantage of designated Federal grant programs, on the application of an eligible recipient, the Secretary may make a supplementary grant for a project for which the recipient is eligible but for which the recipient cannot provide the required non-Federal share because of the economic situation of the recipient.

    (c) __Requirements applicable to supplementary grants__ 

        (1) __Amount of supplementary grants__ 

            The share of the project cost supported by a supplementary grant under this section may not exceed the applicable Federal share under [section 3144 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3144].

        (2) __Form of supplementary grants__ 

        The Secretary shall make supplementary grants by—

            (A) the payment of funds made available under this chapter to the heads of the Federal agencies responsible for carrying out the applicable Federal programs; or

            (B) the award of funds under this chapter, which will be combined with funds transferred from other Federal agencies in projects administered by the Secretary.

        (3) __Federal share limitations specified in other laws__ 

            Notwithstanding any requirement as to the amount or source of non-Federal funds that may be applicable to a Federal program, funds provided under this section may be used to increase the Federal share for specific projects under the program that are carried out in areas described in [section 3161(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s3161/a] above the Federal share of the cost of the project authorized by the law governing the program.
