No such elderly or disabled family may be required to accept services.

    (b) __Responsibilities__ 

    Each service coordinator of a covered federally assisted housing project provided pursuant to this subtitle  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  or the amendments made by this subtitle—  <sup>\[1\]</sup> 

        (1) shall consult with the owner of the housing, tenants, any tenant organizations, any resident management organizations, service providers, and any other appropriate persons, to identify the particular needs and characteristics of elderly and disabled families who reside in the project and any supportive services related to such needs and characteristics;

        (2) shall manage and coordinate the provision of such services for residents of the project;

        (3) may provide training to tenants of the project in the obligations of tenancy or coordinate such training;

        (4) shall meet the minimum qualifications and standards required under [section 8011(d)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s8011/d/4]; and

        (5) may carry out other appropriate activities for residents of the project.

    (c) __Included services__ 

        Supportive services referred to under subsection (b)(1) of this section may include health-related services, mental health services, services for nonmedical counseling, meals, transportation, personal care, bathing, toileting, housekeeping, chore assistance, safety, group and socialization activities, assistance with medications (in accordance with any applicable State laws), case management, personal emergency response, education and outreach regarding telemarketing fraud in accordance with the standards issued under subsection (f) of this section, and other appropriate services. The services may be provided through any agency of the Federal Government or any other public or private department, agency, or organization.

    (d) __Covered federally assisted housing__ 

        For purposes of this subtitle,1 the term “covered federally assisted housing” means housing that is federally assisted housing (as such term is defined in [section 13641(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s13641/2]), except that such term does not include housing described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of such section.

    (e) __Services for low-income elderly or disabled families residing in vicinity of certain projects__ 

        To the extent only that this section applies to service coordinators for covered federally assisted housing described in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), and (G) of [section 13641(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s13641/2], any reference in this section to elderly or disabled residents of a project shall be construed to include low-income elderly or disabled families living in the vicinity of such project.

    (f) __Protection against telemarketing fraud__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish standards for service coordinators in federally assisted housing who are providing education and outreach to elderly persons residing in such housing regarding telemarketing fraud. The standards shall be designed to ensure that such education and outreach informs such elderly persons of the dangers of telemarketing fraud and facilitates the investigation and prosecution of telemarketers engaging in fraud against such residents.

        (2) __Contents__ 

        The standards established under this subsection shall require that any such education and outreach be provided in a manner that—

            (A)

             informs such residents of—

                (i) the prevalence of telemarketing fraud targeted against elderly persons;

                (ii) how telemarketing fraud works;

                (iii) how to identify telemarketing fraud;

                (iv) how to protect themselves against telemarketing fraud, including an explanation of the dangers of providing bank account, credit card, or other financial or personal information over the telephone to unsolicited callers;

                (v) how to report suspected attempts at telemarketing fraud; and

                (vi) their consumer protection rights under Federal law;

            (B) provides such other information as the Secretary considers necessary to protect such residents against fraudulent telemarketing; and

            (C) disseminates the information provided by appropriate means, and in determining such appropriate means, the Secretary shall consider on-site presentations at federally assisted housing, public service announcements, a printed manual or pamphlet, an Internet website, and telephone outreach to residents whose names appear on “mooch lists” confiscated from fraudulent telemarketers.
