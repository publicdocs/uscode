## § 7704a. Report on seismic safety property standards

    (a) __Authority__ 

        The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) shall assess the risk of earthquake-related damage to properties assisted under programs administered by the Secretary and shall develop seismic safety standards for such properties. This section may not be construed to prohibit the Secretary from deferring to local building codes that meet the requirements of the seismic safety standards developed under this section.

    (b) __Standards__ 

        The standards shall be designed to reduce the risk of loss of life to building occupants to the maximum extent feasible and to reduce the risk of shake-related property damage to the maximum extent practicable.

    (c) __Consultation__ 

        In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and may utilize the resources under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (established under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 \[[42 U.S.C. 7701][/us/usc/t42/s7701] et seq.\]) and any other resources as may be required to carry out the activities under this section.
