Such functions of the Administrator under this chapter as are applicable to the nuclear activities transferred pursuant to this subchapter shall be subject to the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \[[42 U.S.C. 2011][/us/usc/t42/s2011] et seq.\], and to other authority applicable to such nuclear activities. The nonnuclear responsibilities and functions of the Administrator referred to in sections 5813 and 5814 of this title shall be carried out pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, applicable authority existing immediately before the effective date of this chapter, or in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended ([42 U.S.C. 2051–205][/us/usc/t42/s2051–205]3).

    (d) __Acquisition of copyrights and patents__ 

    The Administrator is authorized to acquire any of the following described rights if the property acquired thereby is for use in, or is useful to, the performance of functions vested in him:

        (2) Licenses under copyrights, patents, and applications for patents.

        (3) Releases, before suit is brought, for past infringement of patents or copyrights.

    (e) __Dissemination of information__
