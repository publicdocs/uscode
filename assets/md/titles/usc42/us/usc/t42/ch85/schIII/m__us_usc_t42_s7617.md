## § 7617. Economic impact assessment

    (a) __Notice of proposed rulemaking; substantial revisions__ 

    This section applies to action of the Administrator in promulgating or revising—

        (1) any new source standard of performance under [section 7411 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7411],

        (2) any regulation under [section 7411(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7411/d],

        (3) any regulation under part B  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of subchapter I of this chapter (relating to ozone and stratosphere protection),

        (4) any regulation under part C of subchapter I of this chapter (relating to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality),

        (5) any regulation establishing emission standards under [section 7521 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7521] and any other regulation promulgated under that section,

        (6) any regulation controlling or prohibiting any fuel or fuel additive under [section 7545(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7545/c], and

        (7) any aircraft emission standard under [section 7571 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7571].

        Nothing in this section shall apply to any standard or regulation described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this subsection unless the notice of proposed rulemaking in connection with such standard or regulation is published in the Federal Register after the date ninety days after August 7, 1977. In the case of revisions of such standards or regulations, this section shall apply only to revisions which the Administrator determines to be substantial revisions.

    (b) __Preparation of assessment by Administrator__ 

        Before publication of notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to any standard or regulation to which this section applies, the Administrator shall prepare an economic impact assessment respecting such standard or regulation. Such assessment shall be included in the docket required under [section 7607(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7607/d/2] and shall be available to the public as provided in [section 7607(d)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7607/d/4]. Notice of proposed rulemaking shall include notice of such availability together with an explanation of the extent and manner in which the Administrator has considered the analysis contained in such economic impact assessment in proposing the action. The Administrator shall also provide such an explanation in his notice of promulgation of any regulation or standard referred to in subsection (a) of this section. Each such explanation shall be part of the statements of basis and purpose required under sections 7607(d)(3) and 7607(d)(6) of this title.

    (c) __Analysis__ 

    Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the assessment required under this section with respect to any standard or regulation shall contain an analysis of—

        (1) the costs of compliance with any such standard or regulation, including extent to which the costs of compliance will vary depending on (A) the effective date of the standard or regulation, and (B) the development of less expensive, more efficient means or methods of compliance with the standard or regulation;

        (2) the potential inflationary or recessionary effects of the standard or regulation;

        (3) the effects on competition of the standard or regulation with respect to small business;

        (4) the effects of the standard or regulation on consumer costs; and

        (5) the effects of the standard or regulation on energy use.

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to provide that the analysis of the factors specified in this subsection affects or alters the factors which the Administrator is required to consider in taking any action referred to in subsection (a) of this section.

    (d) __Extensiveness of assessment__ 

        The assessment required under this section shall be as extensive as practicable, in the judgment of the Administrator taking into account the time and resources available to the Environmental Protection Agency and other duties and authorities which the Administrator is required to carry out under this chapter.

    (e) __Limitations on construction of section__ 

    Nothing in this section shall be construed—

        (1) to alter the basis on which a standard or regulation is promulgated under this chapter;

        (2) to preclude the Administrator from carrying out his responsibility under this chapter to protect public health and welfare; or

        (3) to authorize or require any judicial review of any such standard or regulation, or any stay or injunction of the proposal, promulgation, or effectiveness of such standard or regulation on the basis of failure to comply with this section.

    (f) __Citizen suits__ 

        The requirements imposed on the Administrator under this section shall be treated as nondiscretionary duties for purposes of [section 7604(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7604/a/2], relating to citizen suits. The sole method for enforcement of the Administrator’s duty under this section shall be by bringing a citizen suit under such section 7604(a)(2) for a court order to compel the Administrator to perform such duty. Violation of any such order shall subject the Administrator to penalties for contempt of court.

    (g) __Costs__ 

        In the case of any provision of this chapter in which costs are expressly required to be taken into account, the adequacy or inadequacy of any assessment required under this section may be taken into consideration, but shall not be treated for purposes of judicial review of any such provision as conclusive with respect to compliance or noncompliance with the requirement of such provision to take cost into account.
