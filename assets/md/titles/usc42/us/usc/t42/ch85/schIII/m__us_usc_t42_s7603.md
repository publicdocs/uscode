## § 7603. Emergency powers

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Administrator, upon receipt of evidence that a pollution source or combination of sources (including moving sources) is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare, or the environment, may bring suit on behalf of the United States in the appropriate United States district court to immediately restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or contributing to such pollution or to take such other action as may be necessary. If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of public health or welfare or the environment by commencement of such a civil action, the Administrator may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect public health or welfare or the environment. Prior to taking any action under this section, the Administrator shall consult with appropriate State and local authorities and attempt to confirm the accuracy of the information on which the action proposed to be taken is based. Any order issued by the Administrator under this section shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain in effect for a period of not more than 60 days, unless the Administrator brings an action pursuant to the first sentence of this section before the expiration of that period. Whenever the Administrator brings such an action within the 60-day period, such order shall remain in effect for an additional 14 days or for such longer period as may be authorized by the court in which such action is brought.

([July 14, 1955, ch. 360][/us/act/1955-07-14/ch360], title III, § 303, as added [Pub. L. 91–604][/us/pl/91/604], § 12(a), Dec. 31, 1970, [84 Stat. 1705][/us/stat/84/1705]; amended [Pub. L. 95–95, title III][/us/pl/95/95/tIII], § 302(a), Aug. 7, 1977, [91 Stat. 770][/us/stat/91/770]; [Pub. L. 101–549, title VII][/us/pl/101/549/tVII], § 704, Nov. 15, 1990, [104 Stat. 2681][/us/stat/104/2681].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 1857h–1 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s1857h–1].

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 303 of act July 14, 1955, was renumbered section 310 by [Pub. L. 91–604][/us/pl/91/604] and is classified to [section 7610 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7610].

 __Amendments__ 

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–549][/us/pl/101/549], § 704(2)–(5), struck out subsec. (a) designation before “Notwithstanding any other”, struck out subsec. (b) which related to violation of or failure or refusal to comply with subsec. (a) orders, and substituted new provisions for provisions following first sentence which read as follows: “If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of such a civil action, the Administrator may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are, or may be, affected by such pollution source (or sources). Prior to taking any action under this section, the Administrator shall consult with the State and local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which the action proposed to be taken is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are, or will be, taking. Such order shall be effective for a period of not more than twenty-four hours unless the Administrator brings an action under the first sentence of this subsection before the expiration of such period. Whenever the Administrator brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for a period of forty-eight hours or such longer period as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.”

    [Pub. L. 101–549][/us/pl/101/549], § 704(1), which directed that “public health or welfare, or the environment” be substituted for “the health of persons and that appropriate State or local authorities have not acted to abate such sources”, was executed by making the substitution for “the health of persons, and that appropriate State or local authorities have not acted to abate such sources” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1977—[Pub. L. 95–95][/us/pl/95/95] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted provisions that, if it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of a civil action, the Administrator may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are, or may be, affected by such pollution source (or sources), that, prior to taking any action under this section, the Administrator consult with the State and local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which the action proposed to be taken is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are, or will be, taking, that the order be effective for a period of not more than twenty-four hours unless the Administrator brings an action under the first sentence of this subsection before the expiration of such period, and that, whenever the Administrator brings such an action within such period, such order be effective for a period of forty-eight hours or such longer period as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter, and added subsec. (b).
