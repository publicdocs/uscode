## § 7524. Civil penalties

    (a) __Violations__ 

        Any person who violates sections  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “section”. </sup></sup>  7522(a)(1), 7522(a)(4), or 7522(a)(5) of this title or any manufacturer or dealer who violates [section 7522(a)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a/3/A] shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000. Any person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates [section 7522(a)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a/3/A] or any person who violates [section 7522(a)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a/3/B] shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,500. Any such violation with respect to paragraph (1), (3)(A), or (4) of [section 7522(a) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a] shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine. Any such violation with respect to [section 7522(a)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a/3/B] shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each part or component. Any person who violates [section 7522(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7522/a/2] shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.

    (b) __Civil actions__ 

        The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under subsection (a) of this section, [section 7545(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7545/d], or [section 7547(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7547/d]. Any action under this subsection may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator’s principal place of business, and the court shall have jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty. In determining the amount of any civil penalty to be assessed under this subsection, the court shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator’s business, the violator’s history of compliance with this subchapter, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator’s ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require. In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.

    (c) __Administrative assessment of certain penalties__ 

        (1) __Administrative penalty authority__ 

            In lieu of commencing a civil action under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, [section 7545(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7545/d], or [section 7547(d) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7547/d], except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General shall not be subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty under this subsection shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and 556 of title 5. The Administrator shall issue reasonable rules for discovery and other procedures for hearings under this paragraph. Before issuing such an order, the Administrator shall give written notice to the person to be assessed an administrative penalty of the Administrator’s proposal to issue such order and provide such person an opportunity to request such a hearing on the order, within 30 days of the date the notice is received by such person. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.

        (2) __Determining amount__ 

            In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this subsection, the Administrator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator’s business, the violator’s history of compliance with this subchapter, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator’s ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.

        (3) __Effect of Administrator’s action__ 

            (A)

             Action by the Administrator under this subsection shall not affect or limit the Administrator’s authority to enforce any provision of this chapter; except that any violation,

                (i) with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this subsection, or

                (ii) for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this subsection,

                shall not be the subject of civil penalty action under subsection (b) of this section.

            (B) No action by the Administrator under this subsection shall affect any person’s obligation to comply with any section of this chapter.

        (4) __Finality of order__ 

            An order issued under this subsection shall become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (5).

        (5) __Judicial review__ 

            Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where such person’s principal place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. Such person shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued within 30 days. The court shall not set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this subsection unless there is not substantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator’s assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court shall not impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator’s assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.

        (6) __Collection__ 

        If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this subsection—

            (A) after the order making the assessment has become final, or

            (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (5) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,

            the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to [section 6621(a)(2) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s6621/a/2] from the date of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States’ enforcement expenses, including attorneys fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate amount of that person’s penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.
