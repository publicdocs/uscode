    (1) such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year, and

    (2) California and such State adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator).

    Nothing in this section or in subchapter II of this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any such State to prohibit or limit, directly or indirectly, the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in California as meeting California standards, or to take any action of any kind to create, or have the effect of creating, a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine different than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under California standards (a “third vehicle”) or otherwise create such a “third vehicle”.
