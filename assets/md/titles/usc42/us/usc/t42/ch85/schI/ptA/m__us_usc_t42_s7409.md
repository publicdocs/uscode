## § 7409. National primary and secondary ambient air quality standards

    (a) __Promulgation__ 

        (1)

         The Administrator—

            (A) within 30 days after December 31, 1970, shall publish proposed regulations prescribing a national primary ambient air quality standard and a national secondary ambient air quality standard for each air pollutant for which air quality criteria have been issued prior to such date; and

            (B) after a reasonable time for interested persons to submit written comments thereon (but no later than 90 days after the initial publication of such proposed standards) shall by regulation promulgate such proposed national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate.

        (2) With respect to any air pollutant for which air quality criteria are issued after December 31, 1970, the Administrator shall publish, simultaneously with the issuance of such criteria and information, proposed national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for any such pollutant. The procedure provided for in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to the promulgation of such standards.

    (b) __Protection of public health and welfare__ 

        (1) National primary ambient air quality standards, prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall be ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health. Such primary standards may be revised in the same manner as promulgated.

        (2) Any national secondary ambient air quality standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall specify a level of air quality the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria, is requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air. Such secondary standards may be revised in the same manner as promulgated.

    (c) __National primary ambient air quality standard for nitrogen dioxide__ 

        The Administrator shall, not later than one year after August 7, 1977, promulgate a national primary ambient air quality standard for NO2 concentrations over a period of not more than 3 hours unless, based on the criteria issued under [section 7408(c) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7408/c], he finds that there is no significant evidence that such a standard for such a period is requisite to protect public health.

    (d) __Review and revision of criteria and standards; independent scientific review committee; appointment; advisory functions__ 

        (1) Not later than December 31, 1980, and at five-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall complete a thorough review of the criteria published under [section 7408 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7408] and the national ambient air quality standards promulgated under this section and shall make such revisions in such criteria and standards and promulgate such new standards as may be appropriate in accordance with [section 7408 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7408] and subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may review and revise criteria or promulgate new standards earlier or more frequently than required under this paragraph.

        (2)

            (A) The Administrator shall appoint an independent scientific review committee composed of seven members including at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences, one physician, and one person representing State air pollution control agencies.

            (B) Not later than January 1, 1980, and at five-year intervals thereafter, the committee referred to in subparagraph (A) shall complete a review of the criteria published under [section 7408 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7408] and the national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards promulgated under this section and shall recommend to the Administrator any new national ambient air quality standards and revisions of existing criteria and standards as may be appropriate under [section 7408 of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7408] and subsection (b) of this section.

            (C) Such committee shall also (i) advise the Administrator of areas in which additional knowledge is required to appraise the adequacy and basis of existing, new, or revised national ambient air quality standards, (ii) describe the research efforts necessary to provide the required information, (iii) advise the Administrator on the relative contribution to air pollution concentrations of natural as well as anthropogenic activity, and (iv) advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of such national ambient air quality standards.

>     “(a) __Report.—__ 

>     The Administrator shall request the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a report to the Congress on the role of national secondary ambient air quality standards in protecting welfare and the environment. The report shall:

>         “(1) include information on the effects on welfare and the environment which are caused by ambient concentrations of pollutants listed pursuant to section 108 \[[42 U.S.C. 7408][/us/usc/t42/s7408]\] and other pollutants which may be listed;

>         “(4) determine ambient concentrations of each such pollutant which would be adequate to protect welfare and the environment from such effects;

>         “(5) estimate the costs and other impacts of meeting secondary standards; and

>         “(6) consider other means consistent with the goals and objectives of the Clean Air Act \[[42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.\] which may be more effective than secondary standards in preventing or mitigating such effects.
