## § 7671j. Labeling

    (a) __Regulations__ 

        The Administrator shall promulgate regulations to implement the labeling requirements of this section within 18 months after November 15, 1990, after notice and opportunity for public comment.

    (b) __Containers containing class I or class II substances and products containing class I substances__ 

        Effective 30 months after November 15, 1990, no container in which a class I or class II substance is stored or transported, and no product containing a class I substance, shall be introduced into interstate commerce unless it bears a clearly legible and conspicuous label stating:

    (c) __Products containing class II substances__ 

        (1) After 30 months after November 15, 1990, and before January 1, 2015, no product containing a class II substance shall be introduced into interstate commerce unless it bears the label referred to in subsection (b) of this section if the Administrator determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that there are substitute products or manufacturing processes (A) that do not rely on the use of such class II substance, (B) that reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment, and (C) that are currently or potentially available.

        (2) Effective January 1, 2015, the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all products containing a class II substance.

    (d) __Products manufactured with class I and class II substances__ 

        (1) In the case of a class II substance, after 30 months after November 15, 1990, and before January 1, 2015, if the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for public comment, makes the determination referred to in subsection (c) of this section with respect to a product manufactured with a process that uses such class II substance, no such product shall be introduced into interstate commerce unless it bears a clearly legible and conspicuous label stating:    “Warning: Manufactured with \[insert name of substance\], a substance which harms public health and environment by destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere”  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period. </sup></sup> 

        (2) In the case of a class I substance, effective 30 months after November 15, 1990, and before January 1, 2015, the labeling requirements of this subsection shall apply to all products manufactured with a process that uses such class I substance unless the Administrator determines that there are no substitute products or manufacturing processes that (A) do not rely on the use of such class I substance, (B) reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment, and (C) are currently or potentially available.

    (e) __Petitions__ 

        (1) Any person may, at any time after 18 months after November 15, 1990, petition the Administrator to apply the requirements of this section to a product containing a class II substance or a product manufactured with a class I or II substance which is not otherwise subject to such requirements. Within 180 days after receiving such petition, the Administrator shall, pursuant to the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section, either propose to apply the requirements of this section to such product or publish an explanation of the petition denial. If the Administrator proposes to apply such requirements to such product, the Administrator shall, by rule, render a final determination pursuant to such criteria within 1 year after receiving such petition.

        (2) Any petition under this paragaph  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph”. </sup></sup>  shall include a showing by the petitioner that there are data on the product adequate to support the petition.

        (3) If the Administrator determines that information on the product is not sufficient to make the required determination the Administrator shall use any authority available to the Administrator under any law administered by the Administrator to acquire such information.

        (4) In the case of a product determined by the Administrator, upon petition or on the Administrator’s own motion, to be subject to the requirements of this section, the Administrator shall establish an effective date for such requirements. The effective date shall be 1 year after such determination or 30 months after November 15, 1990, whichever is later.

        (5) Effective January 1, 2015, the labeling requirements of this subsection  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be “section”. </sup></sup>  shall apply to all products manufactured with a process that uses a class I or class II substance.

    (f) __Relationship to other law__ 

        (1) The labeling requirements of this section shall not constitute, in whole or part, a defense to liability or a cause for reduction in damages in any suit, whether civil or criminal, brought under any law, whether Federal or State, other than a suit for failure to comply with the labeling requirements of this section.

        (2) No other approval of such label by the Administrator under any other law administered by the Administrator shall be required with respect to the labeling requirements of this section.
