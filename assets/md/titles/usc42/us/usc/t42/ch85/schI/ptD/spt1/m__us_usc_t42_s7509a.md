    (a) __Implementation plans and revisions__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an implementation plan or plan revision required under this chapter shall be approved by the Administrator if—

        (1) such plan or revision meets all the requirements applicable to it under the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “this”. </sup></sup>  chapter other than a requirement that such plan or revision demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the relevant national ambient air quality standards by the attainment date specified under the applicable provision of this chapter, or in a regulation promulgated under such provision, and

        (2) the submitting State establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the implementation plan of such State would be adequate to attain and maintain the relevant national ambient air quality standards by the attainment date specified under the applicable provision of this chapter, or in a regulation promulgated under such provision, but for emissions emanating from outside of the United States.

    (b) __Attainment of ozone levels__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any State that establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that, with respect to an ozone nonattainment area in such State, such State would have attained the national ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date, but for emissions emanating from outside of the United States, shall not be subject to the provisions of section 7511(a)(2) or (5) of this title or [section 7511d of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7511d].

    (c) __Attainment of carbon monoxide levels__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any State that establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator, with respect to a carbon monoxide nonattainment area in such State, that such State has attained the national ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide by the applicable attainment date, but for emissions emanating from outside of the United States, shall not be subject to the provisions of section 7512(b)(2) or (9)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. [Section 7512(b) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7512/b] does not contain a par. (9). </sup></sup>  of this title.

    (d) __Attainment of PM–10 levels__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any State that establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that, with respect to a PM–10 nonattainment area in such State, such State would have attained the national ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide by the applicable attainment date, but for emissions emanating from outside the United States, shall not be subject to the provisions of [section 7513(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t42/s7513/b/2].

([July 14, 1955, ch. 360][/us/act/1955-07-14/ch360], title I, § 179B, as added [Pub. L. 101–549, title VIII][/us/pl/101/549/tVIII], § 818, Nov. 15, 1990, [104 Stat. 2697][/us/stat/104/2697].)

 __Establishment of Program To Monitor and Improve Air Quality in Regions Along Border Between United States and Mexico__ 

[Pub. L. 101–549, title VIII][/us/pl/101/549/tVIII], § 815, Nov. 15, 1990, [104 Stat. 2693][/us/stat/104/2693], provided that:

>     “(a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Administrator’) is authorized, in cooperation with the Department of State and the affected States, to negotiate with representatives of Mexico to authorize a program to monitor and improve air quality in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. The program established under this section shall not extend beyond July 1, 1995.

>     “(b) __Monitoring and Remediation.—__ 

>         “(1)  __Monitoring__  __.—__ 

>         The monitoring component of the program conducted under this section shall identify and determine sources of pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards (hereinafter referred to as ‘NAAQS’) and other air quality goals have been established in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include, but not be limited to, the collection of meteorological data, the measurement of air quality, the compilation of an emissions inventory, and shall be sufficient to the extent necessary to successfully support the use of a state-of-the-art mathematical air modeling analysis. Any such monitoring component of the program shall collect and produce data projecting the level of emission reductions necessary in both Mexico and the United States to bring about attainment of both primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air quality goals, in regions along the border in the United States. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include to the extent possible, data from monitoring programs undertaken by other parties.

>         “(2)  __Remediation__  __.—__ 

>         The Administrator is authorized to negotiate with appropriate representatives of Mexico to develop joint remediation measures to reduce the level of airborne pollutants to achieve and maintain primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air quality goals, in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Such joint remediation measures may include, but not be limited to measures included in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Control Techniques and Control Technology documents. Any such remediation program shall also identify those control measures implementation of which in Mexico would be expedited by the use of material and financial assistance of the United States.

>     “(c)  __Annual Reports__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator shall, each year the program authorized in this section is in operation, report to Congress on the progress of the program in bringing nonattainment areas along the border of the United States into attainment with primary and secondary NAAQS. The report issued by the Administrator under this paragraph shall include recommendations on funding mechanisms to assist in implementation of monitoring and remediation efforts.

>     “(d)  __Funding and Personnel__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator may, where appropriate, make available, subject to the appropriations, such funds, personnel, and equipment as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. In those cases where direct financial assistance of the United States is provided to implement monitoring and remediation programs in Mexico, the Administrator shall develop grant agreements with appropriate representatives of Mexico to assure the accuracy and completeness of monitoring data and the performance of remediation measures which are financed by the United States. With respect to any control measures within Mexico funded by the United States, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize resources of Mexico where such utilization would reduce costs to the United States. Such funding agreements shall include authorization for the Administrator to—

>         “(1) review and agree to plans for monitoring and remediation;

>         “(2) inspect premises, equipment and records to insure compliance with the agreements established under and the purposes set forth in this section; and

>         “(3) where necessary, develop grant agreements with affected States to carry out the provisions of this section.”
