            Not later than 10 years after March 30, 2009, in accordance with subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall—

                (i) increase the number of streamgages funded by the national streamflow information program to a quantity of not less than 4,700 sites; and

                (ii) ensure all streamgages are flood-hardened and equipped with water-quality sensors and modernized telemetry.

        (6) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to operate the national streamflow information program for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2023, to remain available until expended.

            (B) __Network enhancement funding__ 

                There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the network enhancements described in paragraph (4) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2019, to remain available until expended.

    (b) __National groundwater resources monitoring__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall develop a systematic groundwater monitoring program for each major aquifer system located in the United States.

        (2) __Program elements__ 

        In developing the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

            (A) establish appropriate criteria for monitoring wells to ensure the acquisition of long-term, high-quality data sets, including, to the maximum extent possible, the inclusion of real-time instrumentation and reporting;

            (B)

             in coordination with the Advisory Committee and State and local water resource agencies—

                (i) assess the current scope of groundwater monitoring based on the access availability and capability of each monitoring well in existence as of March 30, 2009; and

                (ii) develop and carry out a monitoring plan that maximizes coverage for each major aquifer system that is located in the United States; and

            (C) prior to initiating any specific monitoring activities within a State after March 30, 2009, consult and coordinate with the applicable State water resource agency with jurisdiction over the aquifer that is the subject of the monitoring activities, and comply with all applicable laws (including regulations) of the State.

        (3) __Program objectives__ 

        In carrying out the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

            (A) provide data that is necessary for the improvement of understanding with respect to surface water and groundwater interactions;

            (B) by expanding the network of monitoring wells to reach each climate division, support the groundwater climate response network to improve the understanding of the effects of global climate change on groundwater recharge and availability; and

            (C) support the objectives of the assessment program.

        (4) __Improved methodologies__ 

        The Secretary shall—

            (A) improve methodologies relating to the analysis and delivery of data; and

            (B) investigate, develop, and implement new methodologies and technologies to estimate or measure groundwater recharge, discharge, and storage in a more cost-efficient manner.
