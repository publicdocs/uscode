## § 103. Designation of reports

    All reports covering any of the statistics collected under the provisions of this subchapter shall be designated as “Special Reports” followed by the name of whatever bureau or agency of the Department of Commerce is designated by the Secretary to collect and compile such statistics.

([Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158][/us/act/1954-08-31/ch1158], [68 Stat. 1018][/us/stat/68/1018].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., § 111 ([Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139][/us/act/1902-03-06/ch139], § 7, [32 Stat. 52][/us/stat/32/52]; [June 7, 1906, ch. 3048][/us/act/1906-06-07/ch3048], [34 Stat. 218][/us/stat/34/218]; [June 18, 1929, ch. 28][/us/act/1929-06-18/ch28], § 3, [46 Stat. 21][/us/stat/46/21]; 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, § 4(e), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, [53 Stat. 1431][/us/stat/53/1431]; 1940 Reorganization Plan No. III, § 3, eff. June 30, 1940, 5 F.R. 2107, [54 Stat. 1232][/us/stat/54/1232]; [June 25, 1947, ch. 124][/us/act/1947-06-25/ch124], [61 Stat. 163][/us/stat/61/163]; [Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910][/us/act/1950-09-07/ch910], § 4, [64 Stat. 785][/us/stat/64/785]).

    Section was taken from that part of [section 111 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s111], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to designation of reports prepared under that section. For remainder of such section 111, see this subchapter, and Distribution Table.

    [Section 111 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s111], U.S.C. 1952 ed., provided that the reports prepared under the provisions of that section should be designated as “Special Reports of the Census Office”. In this revised section it is provided that such reports shall be designated as “ ‘Special Reports’ followed by the name of whatever bureau or agency of the Department of Commerce is designated by the Secretary to collect and compile such statistics”. This change conforms with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1263][/us/stat/64/1263], which transferred the functions of all agencies, bureaus, officers, and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary, and vested power in him to delegate any of such transferred functions, or any of his other functions, to any of such agencies, bureaus, officers, or employees. See [section 4 of this title][/us/usc/t13/s4].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

    [Section 7 of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139][/us/act/1902-03-06/ch139/s7], [32 Stat. 52][/us/stat/32/52], cited above, from which [section 111 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s111], U.S.C., 1952 ed., was derived, contained additional provisions (which were not classified to the United States Code) relating to the duty of the Director of the Census to publish the Official Register of the United States, and to the transmission to him of the data to be included therein. Such provisions have been omitted as they were superseded by [act Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 421][/us/act/1925-03-03/ch421], § 2(a)(b), [43 Stat. 1105][/us/stat/43/1105], which was formerly classified to [section 3 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s3], U.S.C., 1952 ed., and which, in turn, was repealed by section 5 of [act Aug. 28, 1935, ch. 795][/us/act/1935-08-28/ch795], [49 Stat. 957][/us/stat/49/957], and superseded by sections 1 and 2 of that act. Such sections 1 and 2, as amended, are classified to [section 654 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s654], U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees. Under that section, the Official Register is published by the Civil Service Commission. Provisions relating to its distribution are contained in sections 139, 139a and 280a of title 44, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Public Printing and Documents.
