## § 161. Quinquennial censuses; inclusion of certain data

    The Secretary shall take, compile, and publish for the year 1957 and for every fifth year thereafter a census of governments. Each such census shall include, but shall not be limited to, data on taxes and tax valuations, governmental receipts, expenditures, indebtedness, and employees of States, counties, cities, and other governmental units.

([Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158][/us/act/1954-08-31/ch1158], [68 Stat. 1021][/us/stat/68/1021]; [Pub. L. 85–207][/us/pl/85/207], § 12, Aug. 28, 1957, [71 Stat. 483][/us/stat/71/483].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., § 251 ([Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910][/us/act/1950-09-07/ch910], § 1, [64 Stat. 784][/us/stat/64/784]).

    Section was derived from subsection (a) of [section 251 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s251], U.S.C., 1952 ed. For remainder of such section 251, see Distribution Table.

    Reference to the year 1957 was substituted for reference to the year 1952, since the latter reference is now obsolete.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1957—[Pub. L. 85–207][/us/pl/85/207] struck out “in the United States and in such of its Territories and possessions as may be determined by the Secretary” in last sentence. Geographical provisions now covered by [section 191 of this title][/us/usc/t13/s191].
