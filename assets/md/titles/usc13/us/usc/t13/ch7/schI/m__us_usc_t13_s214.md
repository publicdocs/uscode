    Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§ 73, 83, 122, 208, 252, and [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442], U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare ([Aug. 7, 1916, ch. 274, § 3][/us/act/1916-08-07/ch274/s3], [39 Stat. 437][/us/stat/39/437]; [Apr. 2, 1924, ch. 80, § 3][/us/act/1924-04-02/ch80/s3], [43 Stat. 31][/us/stat/43/31]; [June 18, 1929, ch. 28][/us/act/1929-06-18/ch28], §§ 8, 21, [46 Stat. 23][/us/stat/46/23], 26; [July 25, 1947, ch. 331][/us/act/1947-07-25/ch331], [61 Stat. 437][/us/stat/61/437]; [June 19, 1948, ch. 502, § 2][/us/act/1948-06-19/ch502/s2], [62 Stat. 479][/us/stat/62/479]; [July 15, 1949, ch. 338][/us/act/1949-07-15/ch338], title VI, § 607, [63 Stat. 441][/us/stat/63/441]; [Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910, § 2][/us/act/1950-09-07/ch910/s2], [64 Stat. 784][/us/stat/64/784]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 73, 83 and 208 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that part of section 122 of such title which made such section 208 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), that part of section 252 of such title which made such section 208 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), and that part of subsection (b) of [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such section 208 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title).

    Words “Secretary or other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof” were substituted for reference to the Director of the Census. See Revision Note to [section 9 of this title][/us/usc/t13/s9], into which other parts of sections 73, 83 and 208 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., have been carried.

    The provision in [section 208 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s208], U.S.C., 1952 ed., designating the offense as a felony, was omitted as covered by [section 1 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1], U.S.C., 1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and words in such section “upon conviction thereof” and “in the discretion of the court”, were omitted as surplusage.
