## § 23. Additional officers and employees

    (a) The Secretary may establish, at rates of compensation to be fixed by him without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as many temporary positions as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the work provided for by law. Bureau employees who are transferred to any such temporary positions shall not lose their permanent civil service status by reason of the transfer. The Secretary may make appointments to such temporary positions in conformity with the civil service laws and rules.

    (b) In addition to employees of the Department of Commerce, employees of other departments and independent offices of the Government may, with the consent of the head of the respective department or office, be employed and compensated for field work in connection with the work provided for by law without regard to section 301 of the Dual Compensation Act.

    (c) The Secretary may utilize temporary staff, including employees of Federal, State, or local agencies or instrumentalities, and employees of private organizations to assist the Bureau in performing the work authorized by this title, but only if such temporary staff is sworn to observe the limitations imposed by [section 9 of this title][/us/usc/t13/s9].

([Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158][/us/act/1954-08-31/ch1158], [68 Stat. 1014][/us/stat/68/1014]; [Pub. L. 86–769, § 2][/us/pl/86/769/s2], Sept. 13, 1960, [74 Stat. 911][/us/stat/74/911]; [Pub. L. 88–448, title IV, § 401(p)][/us/pl/88/448/s401/p], Aug. 19, 1964, [78 Stat. 492][/us/stat/78/492]; [Pub. L. 94–521, § 12(b)][/us/pl/94/521/s12/b], Oct. 17, 1976, [90 Stat. 2465][/us/stat/90/2465].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§ 203, 216, and [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442], U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare ([June 18, 1929, ch. 28][/us/act/1929-06-18/ch28], §§ 3, 16, [46 Stat. 21][/us/stat/46/21], 25; [July 6, 1949, ch. 298][/us/act/1949-07-06/ch298], §§ 1, 2, [63 Stat. 406][/us/stat/63/406]; [July 15, 1949, ch. 338][/us/act/1949-07-15/ch338], title VI, § 607, [63 Stat. 441][/us/stat/63/441]; [Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch782], title XI, § 1106(a), [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972]; [July 16, 1952, ch. 912][/us/act/1952-07-16/ch912], [66 Stat. 736][/us/stat/66/736]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 203 and 216 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of subsection (b) of [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such sections 203 and 216 applicable to the censuses of housing.

    [Section 122 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s122], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, transportation, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and [section 252 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s252], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made section 203 of such title applicable to those censuses. However, since the particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by [section 1442(b) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442/b], U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in such [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442] (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section relates only to such decennial censuses.

    In subsection (a), “Departmental Service” was substituted for “District of Columbia”, since the Bureau of the Census now has its headquarters in Maryland, and not in the District of Columbia.

    In this section, a reference to the Bureau of the Census was changed to a reference to the Department of Commerce, and references to the Director of the Census were changed in all but one case to references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1263][/us/stat/64/1263]. See Revision Note to [section 4 of this title][/us/usc/t13/s4]. The provision of [section 203 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s203], U.S.C., 1952 ed., that appointments under the particular provisions thereof that have been carried into subsection (a) of this revised section should be made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Census, have been omitted from such subsection (a) for the same reason. Further, words “or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this title” were inserted after “Director of the Census” in par. (1) of subsection (a), to conform with such 1950 Reorganization Plan.

    The first paragraph of [section 203 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s203], U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for each decennial census period, was omitted as obsolete and superseded, in view of section 122 of such title, which made such section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures and other businesses, and to surveys (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title), thus rendering such first paragraph ineffective and meaningless. See also [section 121(b) of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s121/b], U.S.C., 1952 ed.

    The third proviso in the second paragraph of [section 203 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s203], U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to disabled war veterans, their widows, and, under certain circumstances, to their wives, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).

    Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

    Remainder of [section 203 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s203], U.S.C., 1952 ed., is incorporated in this subchapter, and for remainder of section 216 thereof, and of [section 1442 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1442], U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.
