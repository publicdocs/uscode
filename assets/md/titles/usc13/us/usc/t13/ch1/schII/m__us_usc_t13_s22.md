## § 22. Qualifications of permanent personnel

    All permanent officers and employees of the Bureau shall be citizens of the United States.

([Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158][/us/act/1954-08-31/ch1158], [68 Stat. 1014][/us/stat/68/1014]; [Pub. L. 86–769][/us/pl/86/769], § 1, Sept. 13, 1960, [74 Stat. 911][/us/stat/74/911].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., §§ 5, 6 ([Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139][/us/act/1902-03-06/ch139], §§ 5, 10, [32 Stat. 51][/us/stat/32/51], 53; [June 18, 1929, ch. 28][/us/act/1929-06-18/ch28], § 21, [46 Stat. 26][/us/stat/46/26]).

    Section consolidates [section 5 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s5], U.S.C., 1952 ed., with section 6 of such title.

    A reference to “officers” was inserted for completeness, and the word “permanent” was inserted before “officers and employees” for the purpose of clarity.

    The provision in [section 5 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s5], U.S.C., 1952 ed., excepting unskilled laborers from the requirements for citizenship, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Classification Act of 1949 (5 U.S.C., 1952 ed., ch. 21).

    The provision that appointments and compensation shall be subject to the Classification Act of 1949 is new but is in accordance with existing law. See chapter 21 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.

    The provision in [section 5 of title 13][/us/usc/t13/s5], U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to war veterans and their widows, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of Title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1960—[Pub. L. 86–769][/us/pl/86/769] struck out references to appointment and compensation under the Civil Service laws and the Classification Act of 1949.

 __Program for Employment of Spanish-Origin Personnel in Bureau; Report to Congress__ 

    [Pub. L. 94–311][/us/pl/94/311], § 6, June 16, 1976, [90 Stat. 689][/us/stat/90/689], required Department of Commerce to implement an affirmative action program within Bureau of the Census for employment of personnel of Spanish origin or descent and to submit a report to Congress within one year of June 16, 1976, on progress of such program.
