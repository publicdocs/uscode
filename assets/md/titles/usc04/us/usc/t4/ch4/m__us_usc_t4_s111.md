    The words “received after December 31, 1938,” are omitted as obsolete. The words “pay or” are added before “compensation” for clarity as the word “pay” is used throughout title 5, United States Code, to refer to the remuneration, salary, wages, or compensation for the personal services of a Federal employee. The word “territory” is not capitalized as there are no longer any “Territories.” The words “to tax such compensation” are omitted as unnecessary.

 __Amendments__ 

    1998—[Pub. L. 105–261][/us/pl/105/261] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, and added subsecs. (b) and (c).

 __Effective Date of 1998 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 105–261, div. A, title X][/us/pl/105/261/dA/tX], § 1075(b)(2), Oct. 17, 1998, [112 Stat. 2139][/us/stat/112/2139], provided that: 

> “The amendment made by this subsection \[amending this section\] shall apply to pay and compensation paid after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Oct. 17, 1998\].”
