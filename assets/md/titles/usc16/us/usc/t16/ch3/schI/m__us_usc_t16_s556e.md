    Beginning in fiscal year 1993, and in each year thereafter, only amounts for emergency rehabilitation and wildfire suppression activities that are in excess of the average of such costs for the previous ten years shall be considered “emergency requirements” pursuant to section 901(b)(2)(D)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 2, and such amounts shall on and after November 13, 1991, be so designated.

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 901 of title 2][/us/usc/t2/s901], referred to in text, was amended, and as so amended, section 901(b)(2)(D) no longer refers to “emergency requirements”. However, “emergency requirements” are referred to elsewhere in section 901.
