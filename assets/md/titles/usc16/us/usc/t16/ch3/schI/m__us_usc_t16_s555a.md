## § 555a. Exchange of lands

    Where lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service have been acquired and are being administered under laws which contain no provision for their exchange, the Secretary of Agriculture may convey such lands and in exchange therefor may accept on behalf of the United States title to any lands which in his opinion are suitable for use in connection with activities of the Forest Service. The value of the lands so conveyed by the Secretary of Agriculture shall not exceed the value of the lands accepted by him.
