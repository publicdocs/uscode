## § 4404. Approval of wetlands conservation projects

    (a) __Consideration by Council__ 

    The Council shall recommend wetlands conservation projects to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission based on consideration of—

        (1) the extent to which the wetlands conservation project fulfills the purposes of this chapter, the Plan, or the Agreement;

        (2) the availability of sufficient non-Federal moneys to carry out any wetlands conservation project and to match Federal contributions in accordance with the requirements of [section 4407(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s4407/b];

        (3) the extent to which any wetlands conservation project represents a partnership among public agencies and private entities;

        (4) the consistency of any wetlands conservation project in the United States with the National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan developed under [section 3921 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3921];

        (5) the extent to which any wetlands conservation project would aid the conservation of migratory nongame birds, other fish and wildlife and species that are listed, or are candidates to be listed, as threatened and endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ([16 U.S.C. 1531][/us/usc/t16/s1531] et seq.);

        (6) the substantiality of the character and design of the wetlands conservation project; and

        (7) the recommendations of any partnerships among public agencies and private entities in Canada, Mexico, or the United States which are participating actively in carrying out one or more wetlands conservation projects under this chapter, the Plan, or the Agreement.

    (b) __Recommendations to Migratory Bird Conservation Commission__ 

        The Council shall submit to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission each year a description, including estimated costs, of the wetlands conservation projects which the Council has considered under subsection (a) of this section and which it recommends, in order of priority, that the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission approve for Federal funding under this chapter and [section 669b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s669b/b]. Solely for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.), recommendations by the Council for carrying out wetlands conservation projects under [section 4405(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s4405/a] shall be considered Federal actions requiring the preparation of environmental assessments or, where appropriate, environmental impact statements.

    (c) __Council procedures__ 

    The Council shall establish practices and procedures for the carrying out of its functions under subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The procedures shall include requirements that—

        (1) a quorum of the Council must be present before any business may be transacted; and

        (2) no recommendations referred to in subsection (b) of this section may be adopted by the Council except by the vote of two-thirds of all members present and voting.

    (d) __Council representation on Migratory Bird Conservation Commission__ 

        The Chairman of the Council shall select 2 Council members of the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  United States citizenship to serve with the Chairman as ex officio members of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for the purposes of considering and voting upon wetlands conservation projects recommended by the Council.

    (e) __Approval of Council recommendations by Migratory Bird Conservation Commission__ 

        The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, along with the two members of the Council referred to in subsection (d) of this section, shall approve, reject or reorder the priority of any wetlands conservation projects recommended by the Council based on, to the greatest extent practicable, the criteria of subsection (a) of this section. If the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission approves any wetlands conservation project, Federal funding shall be made available under this chapter and [section 669b(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s669b/b]. If the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission rejects or reorders the priority of any wetlands conservation project recommended by the Council, the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission shall provide the Council and the appropriate Committees with a written statement explaining its rationale for the rejection or the priority modification.

    (f) __Notification of appropriate Committees__ 

        The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission shall submit annually to the appropriate Committees a report including a list and description of the wetlands conservation projects approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for Federal funding under subsection (e) of this section in order of priority; the amounts and sources of Federal and non-Federal funding for such projects; a justification for the approval of such projects and the order of priority for funding such projects; a list and description of the wetlands conservation projects which the Council recommended, in order of priority that the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission approve for Federal funding; and a justification for any rejection or re-ordering of the priority of wetlands conservation projects recommended by the Council that was based on factors other than the criteria of subsection (a) of this section.
