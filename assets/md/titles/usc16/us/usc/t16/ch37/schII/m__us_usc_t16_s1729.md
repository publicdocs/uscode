## § 1729. Funding

    (a) __Cost sharing__ 

        (1) __Projects by qualified youth or conservation corps__ 

            The Secretary is authorized to pay not more than 75 percent of the costs of any appropriate conservation project carried out pursuant to this subchapter on public lands by a qualified youth or conservation corps. The remaining 25 percent of the costs of such a project may be provided from nonfederal sources in the form of funds, services, facilities, materials, equipment, or any combination of the foregoing. No cost sharing shall be required in the case of any appropriate conservation project carried out on Indian lands or Hawaiian home lands under this subchapter.

        (2) __Public Lands Corps projects__ 

            The Secretary is authorized to accept donations of funds, services, facilities, materials, or equipment for the purposes of operating the Public Lands Corps and carrying out appropriate conservation projects by the Corps. However, nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to require any cost sharing for any project carried out directly by the Corps.

    (b) __Funds available under National and Community Service Act__ 

        In order to carry out the Public Lands Corps or to support resource assistants and qualified youth or conservation corps under this subchapter, the Secretary shall be eligible to apply for and receive assistance under section 121(b) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 \[[42 U.S.C. 12571(b)][/us/usc/t42/s12571/b]\].
