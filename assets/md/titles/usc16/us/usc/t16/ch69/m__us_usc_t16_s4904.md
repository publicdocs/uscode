        A species of exotic birds shall be subject to the prohibition on importation established by paragraph (1) until the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for public comment—

            (A) determines that appropriate remedial measures have been taken in the countries of origin for that species, so as to eliminate the threat of trade to the conservation of the species; and

            (A)

                (i) trade in that species is detrimental to the species,

                (ii) there is not sufficient information available on which to base a judgment that the species is not detrimentally affected by trade in that species, or

                (iii) remedial measures have been recommended by the Standing Committee of the Convention that have not been implemented; and

            (B) the suspension might be necessary for the conservation of the species.

        (2) __Termination of suspension__ 

            A species of exotic birds shall be subject to a suspension of importation under paragraph (1) until the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for public comment, makes the findings described in [section 4905(c) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s4905/c] and includes the species in the list published under [section 4905(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s4905/a].
