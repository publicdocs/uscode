## § 835c. Duties of Secretary of the Interior

    (a) __Administer, sell, and exchange lands, dedicate portions for public purposes, etc.__ 

        For the purposes of assisting in the permanent settlement of farm families, protecting project land, and facilitating project development, the Secretary is authorized to administer public lands of the United States in the project area and lands acquired under this section; to sell, exchange, or lease such lands; to dedicate portions of such lands for public purposes in keeping with sound project development; to acquire in the name of the United States, at prices satisfactory to him, such lands or interests in lands, within or adjacent to the project area, as he deems appropriate for the protection, development, or improvement of the project; and to accept donations of real and personal property for the purposes of this Act. Any moneys realized on account of donations for purposes of this Act shall be covered into the Treasury as trust funds.

    (b) __Terms of contracts; qualifications of applicants; prohibited disposals__ 

        Contracts, exchanges, and leases made under this section shall be on terms that, in the Secretary’s judgment, are in keeping with sound project development. In addition, land sale and exchange contracts shall be on a basis that, in the Secretary’s judgment, provides for the return, in a reasonable period of years, of not less than the appraised value of the land and improvements thereon. Qualification of applicants for the purchase of land for irrigation farming shall be prescribed as provided in [section 433 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s433], notwithstanding any other provisions of law. No farm unit shall be sold to, and no contract to sell a farm unit shall be entered into with, any person, corporation, or joint-stock association which has theretofore purchased or entered into a contract to purchase a farm unit from the United States on the Columbia Basin project. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall apply only to the sale of farm units which are suitable for settlement purposes. Farm units which, in the opinion of the Secretary, are not suitable for settlement purposes may be sold with a preference to resident project landowners as supplemental units, subject to the applicable irrigable acreage limitations on the delivery of water, but the purchasers thereof shall not be entitled to benefits of the Act of August 13, 1953 ([67 Stat. 566][/us/stat/67/566]) \[[43 U.S.C. 451][/us/usc/t43/s451] et seq.\] with respect thereto.

>         “(2) Whenever the Secretary, on presentation of adequate evidence by a prospective purchaser or purchasers under subsections (c)(1), (d)(1), or (f) of this section, shall determine that financing of purchases on reasonable terms cannot be arranged from other sources, he is authorized to enter into contracts with such purchasers under which the purchaser would not be required to make a down payment of more than 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as established under section 5, less applicable discounts under this Act. The remainder of the repayment obligation shall be paid with such terms as to amount, repayment period, installments, and interest rate as the Secretary shall determine to be fair and equitable.

>         “(3) The Secretary may assign any installment contract under this section at such times and on such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate.

Appraisals or reappraisals in the town area shall be made only after representatives of the Coulee Dam community, as determined by the Secretary, and of the Columbia River Commission, or such corresponding organization as may succeed it, have been granted an opportunity to offer advice. All appraisals and reappraisals shall be made on the basis of the properties’ fair market value in the locality. In the sale of property to a tenant under subsections 3(b)(1) and (3)(d)(1) of this Act, the value of structural improvements made at such tenant’s own expense shall, to the extent the appraiser or appraisers hereunder determine that such improvements actually enhance the value of the property, be deducted from what would otherwise be the appraised value of the property to be sold; and the difference shall be deemed the appraised value for the purposes of this Act.

Of this amount the Secretary shall pay not more than $100,000 to Grand Coulee and not more than $30,000 to the municipality.
