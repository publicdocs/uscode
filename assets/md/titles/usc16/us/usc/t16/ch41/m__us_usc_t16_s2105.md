## § 2105. Urban and community forestry assistance

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds that—

        (1) the health of forests in urban areas and communities, including cities, their suburbs, and towns, in the United States is on the decline;

        (2) forest lands, shade trees, and open spaces in urban areas and communities improve the quality of life for residents;

        (3) forest lands and associated natural resources enhance the economic value of residential and commercial property in urban and community settings;

        (4) urban trees are 15 times more effective than forest trees at reducing the buildup of carbon dioxide and aid in promoting energy conservation through mitigation of the heat island effect in urban areas;

        (5) tree plantings and ground covers such as low growing dense perennial turfgrass sod in urban areas and communities can aid in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating the heat island effect, and reducing energy consumption, thus contributing to efforts to reduce global warming trends;

        (6) efforts to encourage tree plantings and protect existing open spaces in urban areas and communities can contribute to the social well-being and promote a sense of community in these areas; and

        (7) strengthened research, education, technical assistance, and public information and participation in tree planting and maintenance programs for trees and complementary ground covers for urban and community forests are needed to provide for the protection and expansion of tree cover and open space in urban areas and communities.

    (b) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this section are to—

        (1) improve understanding of the benefits of preserving existing tree cover in urban areas and communities;

        (2) encourage owners of private residences and commercial properties to maintain trees and expand forest cover on their properties;

        (3) provide education programs and technical assistance to State and local organizations (including community associations and schools) in maintaining forested lands and individual trees in urban and community settings and identifying appropriate tree species and sites for expanding forest cover;

        (4) provide assistance through competitive matching grants awarded to local units of government, approved organizations that meet the requirements of [section 501(c)(3) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/c/3], or other local community tree volunteer groups, for urban and community forestry projects;

        (5) implement a tree planting program to complement urban and community tree maintenance and open space programs and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, conserve energy, and improve air quality in addition to providing other environmental benefits;

        (6) promote the establishment of demonstration projects in selected urban and community settings to illustrate the benefits of maintaining and creating forest cover and trees;

        (7) enhance the technical skills and understanding of sound tree maintenance and arboricultural practices including practices involving the cultivation of trees, shrubs and complementary ground covers, of individuals involved in the planning, development, and maintenance of urban and community forests and trees; and

        (8)

         expand existing research and educational efforts intended to improve understanding of—

            (A) tree growth and maintenance, tree physiology and morphology, species adaptations, and forest ecology,

            (B) the value of integrating trees and ground covers,

            (C) the economic, environmental, social, and psychological benefits of trees and forest cover in urban and community environments, and

            (D) the role of urban trees in conserving energy and mitigating the urban heat island.

    (c) __General authority__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to provide financial, technical, and related assistance to State foresters or equivalent State officials for the purpose of encouraging States to provide information and technical assistance to units of local government and others that will encourage cooperative efforts to plan urban forestry programs and to plant, protect, and maintain, and utilize wood from, trees in open spaces, greenbelts, roadside screens, parks, woodlands, curb areas, and residential developments in urban areas. In providing such assistance, the Secretary is authorized to cooperate with interested members of the public, including nonprofit private organizations. The Secretary is also authorized to cooperate directly with units of local government and others in implementing this section whenever the Secretary and the affected State forester or equivalent State official agree that direct cooperation would better achieve the purposes of this section.

    (d) __Program of education and technical assistance__ 

    The Secretary, in cooperation with State foresters and State extension directors or equivalent State officials and interested members of the public, including nonprofit private organizations, shall implement a program of education and technical assistance for urban and community forest resources. The program shall be designed to—

        (1) assist urban areas and communities in conducting inventories of their forest resources, including inventories of the species, number, location, and health of trees in urban areas and communities, identifying opportunities for the establishment of plantings for the purposes of conserving energy, and determining the status of related resources (including fish and wildlife habitat, water resources, and trails);

        (2) assist State and local organizations (including community associations and schools) in organizing and conducting urban and community forestry projects and programs;

        (3)

         improve education and technical support in—

            (A) selecting tree species appropriate for planting in urban and community environments and for promotion of energy conservation;

            (B) providing for proper tree planting, maintenance, and protection in urban areas and communities;

            (C) protecting individual trees and preserving existing open spaces with or without tree cover; and

            (D) identifying opportunities for expanding tree cover in urban areas and communities;

        (4) assist in the development of State and local management plans for trees and associated resources in urban areas and communities; and

        (5) increase public understanding of the energy conservation, economic, social, environmental, and psychological values of trees and open space in urban and community environments and expand knowledge of the ecological relationships and benefits of trees and related resources in these environments.

    (e) __Procurement of plant materials__ 

        The Secretary, in cooperation with State foresters or equivalent State officials, shall assist in identifying sources of plant materials and may procure or otherwise obtain such plant materials from public or private sources and may make such plant materials available to urban areas and communities for the purpose of reforesting open spaces, replacing dead and dying urban trees, promoting energy conservation, and providing other environmental benefits through expanding tree cover in urban areas and communities.

    (f) __Challenge cost-share program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish an urban and community forestry challenge cost-share program.

The Secretary shall annually make awards under the program in accordance with criteria developed in consultation with, and after consideration of recommendations received from, the National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council established under subsection (g). Each State forester or equivalent State official may make recommendations to the Secretary for awards under the program for project proposals in their State which meet such criteria. Awards shall be consistent with the cost-share requirements of this section.

        (2) __Cost-sharing__
