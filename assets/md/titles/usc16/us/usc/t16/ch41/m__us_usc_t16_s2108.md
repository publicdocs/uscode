## § 2108. Consolidation of payments

    (a) __Request by State; excluded funds__ 

        To provide flexibility in funding activities authorized under this chapter, the Secretary may, upon the request of any State, consolidate the annual financial assistance payments to that State under this chapter, in lieu of functional cost sharing mechanisms, formulas, or agreements. However, consolidated payments shall not include money appropriated under section 2103  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title or money from any special Treasury fund established under this chapter.

    (b) __State forest resources programs as basis__ 

        Consolidation of payments made under this section shall be based upon State forest resources programs developed by State foresters or equivalent State officials, and reviewed by the Secretary.

    (c) __Amount of payments__ 

        Consolidated payments to any State during any fiscal year shall not exceed the total amount of non-Federal funds expended within the State during that year to implement its State forest resources program. However, the Secretary may make payments that exceed the non-Federal amount expended for selected activities under the program, if the total Federal expenditure during any fiscal year does not exceed the total non-Federal expenditure during that year under the State forest resources program.

    (d) __Certification requirement by State forester or equivalent State official for Federal payment__ 

        The Secretary may make consolidated payments on the certificate of the State forester or equivalent State official that the conditions for Federal payment have been met.

    (e) __Administration of consolidated payments program not to adversely affect, etc., other programs__ 

        The Secretary shall administer this section to ensure that the use of consolidated payments does not adversely affect or eliminate any program authorized under this chapter.

    (f) __Total annual amount of financial assistance to participating State; financial assistance for special projects not to be included in determining base amount__ 

        Subject to applicable appropriation Acts, the total annual amount of financial assistance to any participating State after July 1, 1978, shall not be less than the base amount of financial assistance provided to that State under all the provisions of law specified in [section 2111 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2111] during the fiscal year in which this chapter is enacted. However, financial assistance for special projects of two years or less duration shall not be included in determining the base amount for any participating State.
