            (C) many small-sized to medium-sized forest products firms lack the tools that would enable them to meet the increasing challenge of foreign competition in domestic and foreign markets; and

            (D) a new cooperative forest products marketing program will improve the competitiveness of the United States forest products industry.

        (2) __Purposes__ 

        The purposes of this section are to—

            (A) provide direct technical assistance to the United States forest products industry to improve marketing activities;

            (B) provide cost-share grants to States to support State and regional forest products marketing programs; and

        The Secretary shall establish a cooperative national forest products marketing program under this chapter that provides—

            (A) technical assistance to States, landowners, and small-sized to medium-sized forest products firms on ways to improve domestic and foreign markets for forest products; and

            (B) grants of financial assistance with matching requirements to the States to assist in State and regional forest products marketing efforts targeted to aid small-sized to medium-sized forest products firms and private, nonindustrial forest landowners.

        (2) __Interstate cooperative agreements__ 

            Grant agreements shall encourage the establishment of interstate cooperative agreements by the States for the purpose of promoting the development of domestic and foreign markets for forest products.

    (c) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __Cooperation with other Federal agencies__ 

            In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall cooperate with Federal departments and agencies to avoid the duplication of efforts and to increase program efficiency.
