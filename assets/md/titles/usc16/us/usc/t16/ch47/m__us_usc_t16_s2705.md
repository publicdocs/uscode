## § 2705. Simplified and expeditious licensing procedures

    (a) __Establishment of program__ 

        The Commission shall establish, in such manner as the Commission deems appropriate, consistent with the applicable provisions of law, a program to use simple and expeditious licensing procedures under the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\] for small hydroelectric power projects in connection with existing dams.

    (b) __Prerequisites__ 

    Before issuing any license under the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\] for the construction or operation of any small hydroelectric power project the Commission—

        (1) shall assess the safety of existing structures in any proposed project (including possible consequences associated with failure of such structures), and

        (2) shall provide an opportunity for consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to the environmental effects of such project.

        Nothing in this subsection exempts any such project from any requirement applicable to any such project under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \[[42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.\], the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act \[[16 U.S.C. 661][/us/usc/t16/s661] et seq.\], the Endangered Species Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1531][/us/usc/t16/s1531] et seq.\], or any other provision of Federal law.

    (c) __Fish and wildlife facilities__ 

        The Commission shall encourage applicants for licenses for small hydroelectric power proj­ects to make use of public funds and other assistance for the design and construction of fish and wildlife facilities which may be required in connection with any development of such proj­ect.

    (d) __Exemptions from licensing requirements in certain cases__ 

        The Commission may in its discretion (by rule or order) grant an exemption in whole or in part from the requirements (including the licensing requirements) of part I of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\] to small hydroelectric power projects having a proposed installed capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or less, on a case-by-case basis or on the basis of classes or categories of projects, subject to the same limitations (to ensure protection for fish and wildlife as well as other environmental concerns) as those which are set forth in subsections (c) and (d) of section 30 of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 823a][/us/usc/t16/s823a] (c) and (d)\] with respect to determinations made and exemptions granted under subsection (b) of such section 30 \[[16 U.S.C. 823a(b)][/us/usc/t16/s823a/b]\]; and subsections (c) and (d) of such section 30 shall apply with respect to actions taken and exemptions granted under this subsection. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the granting of an exemption to a project under this subsection shall in no case have the effect of waiving or limiting the application (to such project) of the second sentence of subsection (b) of this section.
