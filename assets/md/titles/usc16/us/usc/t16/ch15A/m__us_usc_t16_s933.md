## § 933. Advisory Committee

    (a) __Appointment and number of members; factors in selection__ 

    The United States Section shall appoint an advisory committee for each of the Great Lakes, upon which committee each State bordering on the lake may be represented by not more than four members. In making such appointments, the United States Section shall make its selection for each State from a list proposed by the Governor of that State; and shall give due consideration to the interests of—

        (1) State agencies having jurisdiction over fisheries;

        (2) the commercial fishing industry of the lake;

        (3) the sports fishing of the lake; and

        (4) the public at large.

    (b) __Membership on other committees__ 

        A member of the advisory committee for one lake may also be a member of the advisory committee for one or more other lakes.

    (c) __Compensation__ 

        The members of the advisory committee shall receive no compensation from the Government of the United States for their services as such members. Not more than ten members of all the committees, designated by the committees and approved by the United States Section, may be paid by the Government of the United States for transportation expenses and per diem incident to attendance at the annual meeting of the Commission or of the United States Section.

    (d) __Meetings__ 

        The members of the advisory committee for each lake shall be invited to attend all nonexecutive meetings of the United States Section relating to that lake and at such meetings shall be granted opportunity to examine and be heard on all proposed recommendations, programs, and activities relating to that lake.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 107–228][/us/pl/107/228], which directed the substitution of “ten” for “five” and “the annual” for “each” in subsec. (c) of section 4 of the Great Lakes Fisheries Act of 1956, was executed by making the substitutions in subsec. (c) of this section, which is section 4 of the Great Lakes Fishery Act of 1956, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Termination of Advisory Committees__ 

    Advisory committees in existence on Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period following Jan. 5, 1973, unless, in the case of a committee established by the President or an officer of the Federal Government, such committee is renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a committee established by the Congress, its duration is otherwise provided by law. See [section 14 of Pub. L. 92–463][/us/pl/92/463/s14], Oct. 6, 1972, [86 Stat. 776][/us/stat/86/776], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
