        (3) develop sound scientific information on that species’ habitat condition and carrying capacity, total numbers and population trends, or annual reproduction and mortality.

    (e) __Project sustainability__ 

        To the maximum extent practical, in determining whether to approve project proposals under this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to projects which will enhance sustainable conservation programs to ensure effective long-term conservation of rhinoceros and tigers.

    (f) __Project reporting__ 

        Each person that receives assistance under this section for a project shall provide periodic reports, as the Secretary considers necessary, to the Secretary and the Administrator. Each report shall include all information requested by the Secretary, after consulting with the Administrator, for evaluating the progress and success of the project.
