## § 3147. Arctic research study

    (a) __Mission, facilities, and administration of Naval Arctic Research Laboratory__ 

        The Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Energy shall initiate and carry out a study of the mission, facilities and administration of the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL), at Point Barrow, Alaska. The study shall review the historical responsibilities carried out at NARL and their contribution to applied and basic Arctic research. The study shall specifically address and the Secretary shall make recommendations on the need for redirecting the United States Arctic research policy and the role of the NARL facilities in developing and implementing that policy.

    (b) __Assessment of future uses of NARL__ 

    The Secretaries shall assess the future use of NARL in—

        (1) developing relevant scientific information on the Arctic environment and utilizing applied research to (A) deal with the unique problems the Arctic presents in providing public services; (B) minimize the impact of resource development on the environment and the culture of the Native people; and (C) promote international cooperation among the Nations which share responsibility for the Arctic environment;

        (2) assessing the impact of oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation on the Arctic environment, including impact on fish, marine and land mammals, and migratory waterfowl;

        (3) developing advanced design technologies, operational practices, and transportation systems to improve the environmental safety and efficiency of oil and gas exploration and production in the Arctic, including offshore activities;

        (4) enlarging the body of knowledge on Arctic ice conditions and developing practical and efficient means of dealing with potential oil spills and other hazards associated with resource development in Alaska’s Arctic; and

        (5) developing a comprehensive Arctic policy for the Federal Government that will accommodate the need for development and use of Arctic resources with appropriate recognition and consideration given to the unique nature of the Arctic environment and the needs of its Native residents.

    (c) __Recommendations__ 

    After completion of the study, the Secretaries shall make recommendations on—

        (1) changes in the mission and management of NARL necessary to accomplish the research and policy goals addressed in the study;

        (2) the appropriate Federal agency or agencies that should have primary responsibility for management of NARL;

        (3) changes in the organizational structure of NARL that would allow greater involvement by State and private organizations in the use, management and/or funding of NARL; and

        (4) the appropriate level of Federal funding for scientific and technological research on the Arctic environment and its uses.

    (d) __Consultations; opportunity for public review and comment__ 

        In the course of the study, the Secretaries shall consult with representatives of the Department of Navy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, the State of Alaska, local governments, representatives of public and private institutions conducting Arctic research, and Native Village and Regional Corporations in the areas now affected by the activities of NARL. The Secretaries shall provide an opportunity for public review and comment on the draft report and proposed recommendations prior to final approval, and shall include any recommendations of the local community in the final study.

    (e) __Submission of study to Congress__ 

        The Secretaries shall submit the study and their recommendations to the Congress no later than one year after December 2, 1980.

    (f) __Continuation of level of funding for NARL__ 

        Pending submission of the study to the Congress, the President is directed to continue the operation of NARL at the level of funding provided for in fiscal year 1979.
