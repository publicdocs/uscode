    (a) __Suitability of lands for preservation as wilderness; report to President__ 

        As part of the study, the Secretary shall review the suitability or nonsuitability for preservation as wilderness of the Federal lands described in [section 3141 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3141] and report his findings to the President.

    (b) __Presidential recommendations to Congress__ 

        The President shall advise the Senate and the House of Representatives of his recommendations with respect to the designation of the area or any part thereof as wilderness together with a map thereof and a definition of its boundaries.

    (c) __Preservation of wilderness character and potential__ 

        Subject to valid existing rights and the provisions of [section 3142 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3142], the wilderness study area designated by this section shall, until Congress determines otherwise, be administered by the Secretary so as to maintain presently existing wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System.
