## § 3120. Subsistence and land use decisions

    (a) __Factors considered; requirements__ 

    In determining whether to withdraw, reserve, lease, or otherwise permit the use, occupancy, or disposition of public lands under any provision of law authorizing such actions, the head of the Federal agency having primary jurisdiction over such lands or his designee shall evaluate the effect of such use, occupancy, or disposition on subsistence uses and needs, the availability of other lands for the purposes sought to be achieved, and other alternatives which would reduce or eliminate the use, occupancy, or disposition of public lands needed for subsistence purposes. No such withdrawal, reservation, lease, permit, or other use, occupancy or disposition of such lands which would significantly restrict subsistence uses shall be effected until the head of such Federal agency—

        (1) gives notice to the appropriate State agency and the appropriate local committees and regional councils established pursuant to [section 3115 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3115];

        (2) gives notice of, and holds, a hearing in the vicinity of the area involved; and

        (3) determines that (A) such a significant restriction of subsistence uses is necessary, consistent with sound management principles for the utilization of the public lands, (B) the proposed activity will involve the minimal amount of public lands necessary to accomplish the purposes of such use, occupancy, or other disposition, and (C) reasonable steps will be taken to minimize adverse impacts upon subsistence uses and resources resulting from such actions.

    (b) __Environmental impact statement__ 

        If the Secretary is required to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant to [section 4332(2)(C) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s4332/2/C], he shall provide the notice and hearing and include the findings required by subsection (a) as part of such environmental impact statement.

    (c) __State or Native Corporation land selections and conveyances__ 

        Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or impair the ability of the State or any Native Corporation to make land selections and receive land conveyances pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act or the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\].

    (d) __Management or disposal of lands__ 

        After compliance with the procedural requirements of this section and other applicable law, the head of the appropriate Federal agency may manage or dispose of public lands under his primary jurisdiction for any of those uses or purposes authorized by this Act or other law.
