## § 5951. Congressional findings and statement of policy

    (a) __Findings__ 

    In furtherance of sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this title, which directs the Secretary to administer units of the National Park System in accordance with the fundamental purpose of conserving their scenery, wildlife, and natural and historic objects, and providing for their enjoyment in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations, the Congress hereby finds that the preservation and conservation of park resources and values requires that such public accommodations, facilities, and services as have to be provided within such units should be provided only under carefully controlled safeguards against unregulated and indiscriminate use, so that—

        (1) visitation will not unduly impair these resources and values; and

        (2) development of public accommodations, facilities, and services within such units can best be limited to locations that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of such units.

    (b) __Policy__ 

    It is the policy of the Congress that the development of public accommodations, facilities, and services in units of the National Park System shall be limited to those accommodations, facilities, and services that—

        (1) are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located; and

        (2) are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit.
