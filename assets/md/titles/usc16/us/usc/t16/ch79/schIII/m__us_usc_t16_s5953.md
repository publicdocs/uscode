## § 5953. Term of concessions contracts

    A concessions contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less. However, the Secretary may award a contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term.

([Pub. L. 105–391, title IV, § 404][/us/pl/105/391/s404], Nov. 13, 1998, [112 Stat. 3508][/us/stat/112/3508]; [Pub. L. 106–176, title III, § 311][/us/pl/106/176/s311], Mar. 10, 2000, [114 Stat. 34][/us/stat/114/34].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2000—[Pub. L. 106–176][/us/pl/106/176], which directed the substitution of “contract terms and conditions,” for “conract terms and conditions,”, could not be executed because the words ”conract terms and conditions,” did not appear.
