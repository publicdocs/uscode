Such volunteers shall not be deemed employees of the United States Government, except for the purposes of chapter 81 of title 5 relating to compensation for work injuries, and shall not be deemed employees of the Tennessee Valley Authority except for the purposes of tort claims to the same extent as a regular employee of the Tennessee Valley Authority would be under identical circumstances.
