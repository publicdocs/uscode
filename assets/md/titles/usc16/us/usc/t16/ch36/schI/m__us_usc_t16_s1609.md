Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 473 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s473], no land now or hereafter reserved or withdrawn from the public domain as national forests pursuant to section 471  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, or any act supplementary to and amendatory thereof, shall be returned to the public domain except by an act of Congress.
