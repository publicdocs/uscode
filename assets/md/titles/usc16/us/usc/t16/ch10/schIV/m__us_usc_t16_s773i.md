    (f) __Investigations by Secretary of Commerce; powers; process__ 

        (1) In cooperation with such other agencies as may be appropriate, the Secretary may conduct or cause to be conducted such law enforcement investigations as are deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.
