        (2) unless the application is in accordance with the comprehensive statewide historic preservation plan which has been approved by the Secretary after considering its relationship to the comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan prepared pursuant to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 ([78 Stat. 897][/us/stat/78/897]) \[[16 U.S.C. 460][/us/usc/t16/s460]l–4 et seq.\];

        (4) unless the grantee has agreed to make such reports, in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may from time to time require;

        (5) unless the grantee has agreed to assume, after completion of the project, the total cost of the continued maintenance, repair, and administration of the property in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary; and

        (6) until the grantee has complied with such further terms and conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary or advisable.

        Except as permitted by other law, the State share of the costs referred to in paragraph (3) shall be contributed by non-Federal sources. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no grant made pursuant to this subchapter shall be treated as taxable income for purposes of title 26.

    The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), is [Pub. L. 88–578][/us/pl/88/578], Sept. 3, 1964, [78 Stat. 897][/us/stat/78/897], as amended, which is classified generally to part B (§ 460l–4 et seq.) of subchapter LXIX of chapter 1 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 460l–4 of this title and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    2000—Subsec. (a)(3). [Pub. L. 106–208][/us/pl/106/208] substituted “year;” for “year.” at end.

    1992—Subsec. (a)(3). [Pub. L. 102–575, § 4009(1)][/us/pl/102/575/s4009/1], amended par. (3) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (3) read as follows: “for more than 50 per centum of the aggregate cost of carrying out projects and programs specified in section 470a(d)(1) and (2) of this title in any one fiscal year, except that for the costs of State or local historic surveys or inventories the Secretary shall provide 70 per centum of the aggregate cost involved in any one fiscal year.”

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 102–575, § 4009(2)][/us/pl/102/575/s4009/2], which directed amendment of subsec. (b) by striking out “, in which case a grant to the National Trust may include funds for the maintenance, repair, and administration of the property in a manner satisfactory for the Secretary”, was executed by striking out “, in which case a grant to the National Trust may include funds for the maintenance, repair, and administration of the property in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary” after “United States” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Subsecs. (d), (e). [Pub. L. 102–575, § 4009(3)][/us/pl/102/575/s4009/3], added subsec. (d), relating to availability, and subsec. (e).

    1986—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–515, § 202(a)][/us/pl/96/515/s202/a], (b), in par. (3) substituted provision directing that no grant be made for more than 50 per centum of the aggregate cost of carrying out projects and programs specified in section 470a(d)(1) and (2) of this title in any one fiscal year, except that for costs of State or local historic surveys or inventories the Secretary provide 70 per centum of the aggregate cost involved in any one fiscal year for provision directing that no grant be made for more than 50 per centum of the total cost involved, as determined by the Secretary, which determination was to be final, and inserted provision following cl. (6), that, except as otherwise permitted, the State share of the costs referred to in par. (3) be contributed by non-Federal sources and no grant made be treated as taxable income.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 96–515, § 202(c)][/us/pl/96/515/s202/c], struck out subsec. (c) which authorized the Secretary in his discretion to waive the requirements of subsec. (a)(3) of this section for the purposes of making grants for the preparation of statewide historic preservation plans and surveys and project plans and restricted any grant made pursuant to this subsection to not to exceed 70 per centum of the cost of the project, with the total cost of grants made pursuant to this subsection in any fiscal year not to exceed one-half of the funds appropriated for that fiscal year pursuant to [section 470h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s470h].

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–422][/us/pl/94/422] reenacted subsecs. (a) and (b) without change, added subsec. (c), and redesignated former subsec. (c) as (d).
