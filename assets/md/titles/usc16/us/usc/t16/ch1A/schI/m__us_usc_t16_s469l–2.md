## § 469l–2. Preservation of historic sites or structures

    (a) __Authority to make grants__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior may make grants in accordance with this section for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings or structures associated with the Underground Railroad, and for related research and documentation to sites, programs, or facilities that have been included in the national network.

    (b) __Grant conditions__ 

    Any grant made under this section shall provide that—

        (1) no change or alteration may be made in property for which the grant is used except with the agreement of the property owner and the Secretary;

        (2) the Secretary shall have the right of access at reasonable times to the public portions of such property for interpretive and other purposes; and

        (3) conversion, use, or disposal of such property for purposes contrary to the purposes of sections 469l to 469l–3 of this title, as determined by the Secretary, shall result in a right of the United States to compensation equal to all Federal funds made available to the grantee under sections 469l to 469l–3 of this title.

    (c) __Matching requirement__ 

        The Secretary may obligate funds made available for a grant under this section only if the grantee agrees to match, from funds derived from non-Federal sources, the amount of the grant with an amount that is equal to or greater than the grant. The Secretary may waive the requirement of the preceding sentence with respect to a grant if the Secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such a waiver is in the public interest to assure the preservation of historically significant resources.
