        (2) foster educational programs relating to the history, practice, and contribution to society of historic light stations;

        (3) sponsor or conduct research and study into the history of light stations;

        (4) maintain a listing of historic light stations; and

        (5) assess the effectiveness of the program established by this section regarding the conveyance of historic light stations.

    (b) __Conveyance of historic light stations__ 

        (1) __Process and policy__ 

            Not later than 1 year after October 24, 2000, the Secretary and the Administrator shall establish a process and policies for identifying, and selecting, an eligible entity to which a historic light station could be conveyed for education, park, recreation, cultural, or historic preservation purposes, and to monitor the use of such light station by the eligible entity.

        (2) __Application review__ 

            The Secretary shall review all applications for the conveyance of a historic light station, when the agency with administrative jurisdiction over the historic light station has determined the property to be “excess property” as that term is defined in [section 102(3) of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s102/3], and forward to the Administrator a single approved application for the conveyance of the historic light station. When selecting an eligible entity, the Secretary shall consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer of the State in which the historic light station is located.

        (3) __Conveyance of historic light stations__ 

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall convey, by quitclaim deed, without consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the historic light station, subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (c) of this section after the Secretary’s selection of an eligible entity. The conveyance of a historic light station under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act ([42 U.S.C. 11301][/us/usc/t42/s11301] et seq.) or section 416(d) of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 ([Public Law 105–383][/us/pl/105/383]).

                (i) Historic light stations located within the exterior boundaries of a unit of the National Park System or a refuge within the National Wildlife Refuge System shall be conveyed or sold only with the approval of the Secretary.

                (ii) If the Secretary approves the conveyance of a historic light station referenced in this paragraph, such conveyance shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (c) of this section and any other terms or conditions the Secretary considers necessary to protect the resources of the park unit or wildlife refuge.

                (iii) If the Secretary approves the sale of a historic light station referenced in this paragraph, such sale shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) and (H) of subsection (c)(1) of this section and subsection (c)(2) of this section and any other terms or conditions the Secretary considers necessary to protect the resources of the park unit or wildlife refuge.

                (iv) For those historic light stations referenced in this paragraph, the Secretary is encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate eligible entities, as provided in this subchapter, to the extent such cooperative agreements are consistent with the Secretary’s responsibilities to manage and administer the park unit or wildlife refuge, as appropriate.

    (c) __Terms of conveyance__
