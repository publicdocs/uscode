 __Proc. No. 3339. Establishment of Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve__ 

    Proc. No. 3339, Mar. 15, 1960, 25 F.R. 2352, provided:

    WHEREAS there is situated seaward from the coast of Key Largo, Florida, an undersea coral reef formation which is part of the only living coral reef formation along the coast of North America; and

    WHEREAS this unique coral formation and its associated marine life are of great scientific interest and value to students of the sea; and

    WHEREAS this coral reef is considered to be one of the most beautiful formations of its kind in the world; and

    WHEREAS the reef is being subjected to commercial exploitation and is in danger of destruction; and

    WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve this formation of great scientific and esthetic importance for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and

    WHEREAS a portion of this reef lies inside the three-mile limit in the area relinquished to the State of Florida by the United States through the Submerged Lands Act, approved May 22, 1953 ([67 Stat. 29][/us/stat/67/29]; [43 U.S.C. 1301][/us/usc/t43/s1301] et seq.), and the remainder lies on the sea bed of the outer Continental Shelf outside the seaward boundary of the State of Florida and appertains to the United States, as declared by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, approved August 7, 1953 ([67 Stat. 462][/us/stat/67/462]; [43 U.S.C. 1331][/us/usc/t43/s1331] et seq.); and

    WHEREAS the United States and the State of Florida are desirous of cooperating for the purpose of preserving the scenic and scientific values of this area unimpaired for the benefit of future generations; and

    WHEREAS by the terms of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act the United States has jurisdiction over the lands of the outer Continental Shelf and has the exclusive right to dispose of the natural resources of the sea bed and subsoil thereof; and

    WHEREAS section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \[subsec. (a) of [section 1341 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1341], Public Lands\] authorizes the President to withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf; and

    WHEREAS section 5 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \[[section 1334 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1334]\] authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe rules and regulations for the conservation of the natural resources of the outer Continental Shelf and to cooperate with the conservation agencies of adjacent States in the enforcement of conservation laws, rules, and regulations:

    NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, particularly section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \[subsec. (a) of [section 1341 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1341]\], do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, the following-described area is designated as the Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve, and so much thereof as lies on the outer Continental Shelf is withdrawn from disposition:

    That portion of the outer Continental Shelf situated seaward of a line three geographic miles from Key Largo, Monroe County, Florida, lying and being within the following described area:

    Beginning at a point on the 60-foot depth curve (10-fathom line) as delineated on Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart 1249 (approximate Latitude 25°17′36′′ N., Longitude 80°10′00′′ W.), 200 yards southeast of Flashing White Light—Whistle Buoy “2”; thence northwesterly approximately 7,000 yards through Whistle Buoy “2” to Can Buoy “21” (approximate Latitude 25°20′06′′ N., Longitude 80°12′36′′ W.) southeast of Old Rhodes Key; thence southwesterly about 6,900 yards to Can Buoy “25”; thence southwesterly approximately 5,500 yards to Can Buoy “27”; thence southwesterly approximately 5,000 yards to Flashing Green Light “31BH” in Hawk Channel southeast of Point Elizabeth; thence southwesterly approximately 10,650 yards to Black Day Beacon “33” in Hawk Channel east of Point Willie; thence southwesterly approximately 9,800 yards to Flashing White Light “35” on Mosquito Bank east of Point Charles; thence southwesterly approximately 5,400 yards to Black Day Beacon “37” (approximate Latitude 25°02′25′′ N., Longitude 80°25′36′′ W.), southeast of Rodriguez Key; thence southeasterly approximately 7,100 yards (pass 600 yards southwest of Flashing Light “2” at Molasses Reef) to the 60-foot depth curve (10-fathom line) 800 yards due south of said light at Molasses Reef (approximate Latitude 25°00′18′′ N., Longitude 80°22′30′′ W.); thence northeasterly with the 60-foot depth curve and 10-fathom line (passing easterly of French Reef, Dixie Shoal, The Elbow, and Carysfort Reef) approximately 21 miles to the point of beginning.

    I call upon all persons to join in the effort to protect and preserve this natural wonder for the benefit of future generations.

    The Secretary of the Interior is requested to prescribe rules and regulations governing the protection and conservation of the coral and other mineral resources in this area and to cooperate with the State of Florida and its conservation agencies in the preservation of the reef.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

    DONE at the City of Washington this fifteenth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.

    \[seal\]

                              Dwight D. Eisenhower.
