    During the period beginning on January 1, 2014, and ending on the last day of the calendar year during which the current appraisal cycle is completed under subsection (c), the Secretary shall assess an interim annual fee for recreational residences on National Forest System land that is an amount equal to the lesser of—

    (c) __Completion of current appraisal cycle__ 

        Not later than 1 year after December 19, 2014, the Secretary shall complete the current appraisal cycle, including receipt of timely second appraisals, for recreational residences on National Forest System land in accordance with the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000 ([16 U.S.C. 6201][/us/usc/t16/s6201] et seq.)

If a second appraisal—

        (1) was approved by the Secretary, the value established by the second appraisal shall be the base value assigned to the lot; or

        (2) was not approved by the Secretary, the value established by the initial appraisal shall be the base value assigned to the lot.

        On the date of completion of the current appraisal cycle, and before assessing a fee under subsection (f), the Secretary shall make a 1-time adjustment to the value of each appraised lot on which a recreational residence is located to reflect any change in value occurring after the date of the most recent appraisal for the lot, in accordance with the 4th quarter of 2012 National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index.
