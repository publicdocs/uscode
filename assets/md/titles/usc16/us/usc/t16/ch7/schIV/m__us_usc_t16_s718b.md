            (B) on the condition that the individual so taking the waterfowl wrote the signature of the individual in ink across the face of the stamp prior to the taking; and

            (C) during the hunting year for which the stamp was issued.

        (5) __Unused stamps__ 

            (A) __Definition of retail dealer__ 

            In this paragraph, the term “retail dealer” means—

                (i) any individual or entity that is regularly engaged in the business of retailing hunting or fishing equipment; and

                (ii) any individual or entity duly authorized to act as an agent of a State or political subdivision of a State for the sale of State or county hunting or fishing licenses.

            (B) __Redemption of unused stamps__ 

            The Department of the Interior, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, shall provide for the redemption, on or before the 30th day of June of each year, of unused stamps issued for the year under this subchapter that—

        have been obligated for expenditure.

    (c) __Reduction in price of stamp__
