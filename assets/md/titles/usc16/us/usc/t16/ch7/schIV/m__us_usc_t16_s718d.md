        (2) paid into the Treasury of the United States; and

        (3) reserved and set aside as a special fund, to be known as the “Migratory Bird Conservation Fund” (referred to in this section as the “fund”), to be administered by the Secretary, in which there shall be a subaccount to which the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer all amounts in excess of $15 that are received from the sale of each stamp sold for each hunting year after hunting year 2013.

    (b) __Use of funds__ 

    All funds received into the fund are appropriated for the following purposes, to remain available until expended:

        (2) __Areas for refuges__ 

            Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) and subsection (c), the remainder shall be available for the location, ascertainment, and acquisition of suitable areas for migratory bird refuges under the provisions of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act ([16 U.S.C. 715][/us/usc/t16/s715] et seq.) and for the administrative costs incurred in the acquisition of such areas.
