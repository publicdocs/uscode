            (A) the nature of the investigation;

            (B) the right of the operator to submit comments, information, or evidence bearing on the investigation and to receive, upon the operator’s timely written request to the Secretary, an opportunity to present such comments, information, or evidence orally to the Secretary or the Secretary’s representative within 30 days after receipt of such notification.

    (c) __Notice requirements to Pacific Island Party concerning institution and outcome of legal proceedings__ 

        (1) Prior to instituting any legal proceedings under this chapter for any action which involves an alleged infringement of the Treaty in waters within the jurisdiction of a Pacific Island Party, the Secretary, through the Secretary of State, shall notify the Pacific Island Party in accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 4 of the Treaty that the proceedings will be instituted. Such notice shall include a statement of the facts believed to show an infringement of the Treaty and the nature of the proposed proceedings, including any proposed charges and any proposed penalties. The Secretary shall not institute such proceedings if the Pacific Island Party objects within 30 days after the effective date of the notice under Article 10 of the Treaty.
