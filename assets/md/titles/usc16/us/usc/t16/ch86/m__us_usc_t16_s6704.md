    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall—

        (1) not later than 180 days after October 5, 2004, establish Institutes to promote the use of adaptive ecosystem management to reduce the risk of wildfires, and restore the health of forest and woodland ecosystems, in the interior West; and

        (2) provide assistance to the Institutes to promote the use of collaborative processes and adaptive ecosystem management in accordance with paragraph (1).

    (b) __Location__ 

        (1) __Existing Institutes__ 

            The Secretary may designate an institute in existence on October 5, 2004, to serve as an Institute established under this chapter.

        (2) __States__ 

        Of the Institutes established under this chapter, the Secretary shall establish 1 Institute in each of—

            (A) the State of Arizona, to be located at Northern Arizona University;

            (B) the State of New Mexico, to be located at New Mexico Highlands University, while engaging the full resources of the consortium of universities represented in the Institute of Natural Resource Analysis and Management (INRAM); and

            (C) the State of Colorado.

    (c) __Duties__ 

    Each Institute shall—

        (1) develop, conduct research on, transfer, promote, and monitor restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments to reduce the risk of severe wildfires and improve the health of dry forest and woodland ecosystems in the interior West;

        (2) synthesize and adapt scientific findings from conventional research to implement restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments on a landscape scale using an adaptive ecosystem management framework;

        (3) translate for and transfer to affected entities any scientific and interdisciplinary knowledge about restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments;

        (4) assist affected entities with the design of adaptive management approaches (including monitoring) for the implementation of restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction treatments; and

        (5) provide peer-reviewed annual reports.

    (d) __Qualifications__ 

    Each Institute shall—

        (1) develop and demonstrate capabilities in the natural, physical, social, and policy sciences; and

        (2) explicitly integrate those disciplines in the performance of the duties listed in subsection (c).

    (e) __Cooperation__ 

    Each Institute may cooperate with—

        (1) researchers and cooperative extension programs at colleges, community colleges, and universities in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado that have a demonstrated capability to conduct research described in subsection (c); and

        (2) other organizations and entities in the interior West (such as the Western Governors’ Association).

    (f) __Annual work plans__ 

        As a condition of the receipt of funds made available under this chapter, for each fiscal year, each Institute shall develop in consultation with the Secretary, for review by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, an annual work plan that includes assurances, satisfactory to the Secretaries, that the proposed work of the Institute will serve the informational needs of affected entities.

    (g) __Establishment of additional Institutes__ 

        If after 2 years after October 5, 2004, the Secretary finds that the Institute model established at the locations named in subsection (b)(2) would be constructive for other interior West States, the Secretary may establish 1 institute in each of those States.
