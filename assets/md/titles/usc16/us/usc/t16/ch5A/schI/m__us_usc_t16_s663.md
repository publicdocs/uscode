    (b) __Use and availability of waters, land, or interests therein__ 

        The use of such waters, land, or interests therein for wildlife conservation purposes shall be in accordance with general plans approved jointly (1) by the head of the particular department or agency exercising primary administration in each instance, (2) by the Secretary of the Interior, and (3) by the head of the agency exercising the administration of the wildlife resources of the particular State wherein the waters and areas lie. Such waters and other interests shall be made available, without cost for administration, by such State agency, if the management of the properties relate to the conservation of wildlife other than migratory birds, or by the Secretary of the Interior, for administration in such manner as he may deem advisable, where the particular properties have value in carrying out the national migratory bird management program: Provided, That nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with the States or in making lands available to the States with respect to the management of wildlife and wildlife habitat on lands administered by him.

    (c) __Acquisition of land, waters, and interests therein; report to Congress__ 

        When consistent with the purposes of sections 661 to 666c of this title and the reports and findings of the Secretary of the Interior prepared in accordance with [section 662 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s662], land, waters, and interests therein may be acquired by Federal construction agencies for the wildlife conservation and development purposes of sections 661 to 666c of this title in connection with a project as reasonably needed to preserve and assure for the public benefit the wildlife potentials of the particular project area: Provided, That before properties are acquired for this purpose, the probable extent of such acquisition shall be set forth, along with other data necessary for project authorization, in a report submitted to the Congress, or in the case of a project previously authorized, no such properties shall be acquired unless specifically authorized by Congress, if specific authority for such acquisition is recommended by the construction agency.

    (d) __Use of acquired properties__ 

        Properties acquired for the purposes of this section shall continue to be used for such purposes, and shall not become the subject of exchange or other transactions if such exchange or other transaction would defeat the initial purpose of their acquisition.

    (e) __Availability of Federal lands acquired or withdrawn for Federal water-resource purposes__ 

        Federal lands acquired or withdrawn for Federal water-resource purposes and made available to the States or to the Secretary of the Interior for wildlife management purposes, shall be made available for such purposes in accordance with sections 661 to 666c of this title, notwithstanding other provisions of law.

    (f) __National forest lands__ 

        Any lands acquired pursuant to this section by any Federal agency within the exterior boundaries of a national forest shall, upon acquisition, be added to and become national forest lands, and shall be administered as a part of the forest within which they are situated, subject to all laws applicable to lands acquired under the provisions of the Act of March 1, 1911 ([36 Stat. 961][/us/stat/36/961]), unless such lands are acquired to carry out the National Migratory Bird Management Program.
