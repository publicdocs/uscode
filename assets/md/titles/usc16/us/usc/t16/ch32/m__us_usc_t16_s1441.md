        (2) shall not authorize the conduct of any activity for a period of more than 5 years unless renewed by the Secretary;

        (3) shall require that activities carried out under the permit be conducted in a manner that does not destroy, cause the loss of, or injure sanctuary resources; and

        (4) shall require the permittee to purchase and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, or post an equivalent bond, against claims arising out of activities conducted under the permit and to agree to hold the United States harmless against such claims.

    (d) __Fees__ 

        (1) __Assessment and collection__ 

            The Secretary may assess and collect fees for the conduct of any activity under a permit issued under this section.

            (B) costs incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the Secretary as a direct result of the conduct of the activity for which the permit is issued, including costs of monitoring the conduct of the activity; and

            (C) an amount which represents the fair market value of the use of the sanctuary resource.

        (3) __Use of fees__ 

        Amounts collected by the Secretary in the form of fees under this section may be used by the Secretary—

            (A) for issuing and administering permits under this section; and

            (B) for expenses of managing national marine sanctuaries.

        (4) __Waiver or reduction of fees__ 

            The Secretary may accept in-kind contributions in lieu of a fee under paragraph (2)(C), or waive or reduce any fee assessed under this subsection for any activity that does not derive profit from the access to or use of sanctuary resources.

    (e) __Violations__ 

    Upon violation of a term or condition of a permit issued under this section, the Secretary may—

        (1) suspend or revoke the permit without compensation to the permittee and without liability to the United States;
