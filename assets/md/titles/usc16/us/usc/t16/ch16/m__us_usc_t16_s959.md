        (2) with or without a warrant or other process, to search any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and, if as a result of such search he has reasonable cause to believe that such vessel or any person on board is engaging in operations in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued thereunder, then to arrest such person.

    (e) __Seizures and disposition of fish__

    (f) __Security__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 2464 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2464], when a warrant of arrest or other process in rem is issued in any cause under this section, the marshal or other officer shall stay the execution of such process, or discharge any fish seized if the process has been levied, on receiving from the claimant of the fish a bond or stipulation for the value of the property with sufficient surety to be approved by a judge of the district court having jurisdiction of the offense, conditioned to deliver the fish seized, if condemned, without impairment in value or, in the discretion of the court, to pay its equivalent value in money or otherwise to answer the decree of the court in such cause. Such bond or stipulation shall be returned to the court and judgment thereon against both the principal and sureties may be recovered in event of any breach of the conditions thereof as determined by the court. In the discretion of the accused, and subject to the direction of the court, the fish may be sold for not less than its reasonable market value and the proceeds of such sale placed in the registry of the court pending judgment in the case.
