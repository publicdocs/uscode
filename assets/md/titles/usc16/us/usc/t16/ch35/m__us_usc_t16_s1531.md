## § 1531. Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds and declares that—

        (1) various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation;

        (2) other species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been so depleted in numbers that they are in danger of or threatened with extinction;

        (3) these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people;

        (4)

         the United States has pledged itself as a sovereign state in the international community to conserve to the extent practicable the various species of fish or wildlife and plants facing extinction, pursuant to—

            (A) migratory bird treaties with Canada and Mexico;

            (B) the Migratory and Endangered Bird Treaty with Japan;

            (C) the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere;

            (D) the International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries;

            (E) the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean;

            (F) the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; and

            (G) other international agreements; and

        (5) encouraging the States and other interested parties, through Federal financial assistance and a system of incentives, to develop and maintain conservation programs which meet national and international standards is a key to meeting the Nation’s international commitments and to better safeguarding, for the benefit of all citizens, the Nation’s herit­age in fish, wildlife, and plants.

    (b) __Purposes__ 

        The purposes of this chapter are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Policy__ 

        (1) It is further declared to be the policy of Congress that all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.

        (2) It is further declared to be the policy of Congress that Federal agencies shall cooperate with State and local agencies to resolve water resource issues in concert with conservation of endangered species.
