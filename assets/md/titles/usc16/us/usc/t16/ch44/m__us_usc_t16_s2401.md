## § 2401. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds that—

        (1) for well over a quarter of a century, scientific investigation has been the principal activity of the Federal Government and United States nationals in Antarctica;

        (2) more recently, interest of American tourists in Antarctica has increased;

        (3) as the lead civilian agency in Antarctica, the National Science Foundation has long had responsibility for ensuring that United States scientific activities and tourism, and their supporting logistics operations, are conducted with an eye to preserving the unique values of the Antarctic region;

        (4) the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol establish a firm foundation for the conservation of Antarctic resources, for the continuation of international cooperation and the freedom of scientific investigation in Antarctica; and

        (5) the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol establish international mechanisms and create legal obligations necessary for the maintenance of Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science.

    (b) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the conservation and protection of the fauna and flora of Antarctica, and of the ecosystem upon which such fauna and flora depend, consistent with the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol.
