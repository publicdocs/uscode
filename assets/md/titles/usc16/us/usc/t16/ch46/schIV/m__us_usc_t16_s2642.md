>             “(C) developing plans and programs to use demand response to respond to peak demand or emergency needs; and

>             “(D) identifying specific measures consumers can take to participate in these demand response programs.

>         “(3)  __Report__  __.—__ 

>         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \[Aug. 8, 2005\], the \[Federal Energy Regulatory\] Commission shall prepare and publish an annual report, by appropriate region, that assesses demand response resources, including those available from all consumer classes, and which identifies and reviews—

It is further the policy of the United States that the benefits of such demand response that accrue to those not deploying such technology and devices, but who are part of the same regional electricity entity, shall be recognized.”
