## § 4301. Findings, purposes, and policy

    The Congress finds and declares that—

        (1) significant caves on Federal lands are an invaluable and irreplaceable part of the Nation’s natural heritage; and

        (2) in some instances, these significant caves are threatened due to improper use, increased recreational demand, urban spread, and a lack of specific statutory protection.

    (b) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this chapter are—

        (1) to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use, enjoyment, and benefit of all people; and

        (2) to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.

    (c) __Policy__ 

        It is the policy of the United States that Federal lands be managed in a manner which protects and maintains, to the extent practical, significant caves.
