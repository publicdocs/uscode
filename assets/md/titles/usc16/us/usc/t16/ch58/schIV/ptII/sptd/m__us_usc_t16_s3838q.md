            (F) specify the manner in which the eligible entity will evaluate and report the use of funds to the Secretary;

            (C) __Priority__ 

                The Secretary may accord a higher priority to proposals from eligible entities that leverage a greater share of the purchase price of the easement.

        (4) __Violation__ 

        If an eligible entity violates the terms or conditions of a cooperative agreement entered into under this subsection—

            (A) the cooperative agreement shall remain in force; and
