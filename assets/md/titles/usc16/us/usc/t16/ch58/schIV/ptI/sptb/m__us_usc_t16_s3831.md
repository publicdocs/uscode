## § 3831. Conservation reserve

    (a) __In general__ 

        Through the 2018 fiscal year, the Secretary shall formulate and carry out a conservation reserve program under which land is enrolled through the use of contracts to assist owners and operators of land specified in subsection (b) of this section to conserve and improve the soil, water, and wildlife resources of such land and to address issues raised by State, regional, and national conservation initiatives.

    (b) __Eligible land__ 

    The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart—

        (1)

         highly erodible cropland that—

            (A)

                (i) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the agricultural production capability for future generations; or

                (ii) cannot be farmed in accordance with a plan that complies with the requirements of subchapter II of this chapter; and

            (B) the Secretary determines had a cropping history or was considered to be planted for 4 of the 6 years preceding February 7, 2014 (except for land enrolled in the conservation reserve program as of that date);

        (2) marginal pasture land to be devoted to appropriate vegetation, including trees, in or near riparian areas, or devoted to similar water quality purposes (including marginal pastureland converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat);

        (3)

         grasslands that—

            (A) contain forbs or shrubland (including improved rangeland and pastureland) for which grazing is the predominant use;

            (B) are located in an area historically dominated by grasslands; and

            (C) could provide habitat for animal and plant populations of significant ecological value if the land is retained in its current use or restored to a natural condition;

        (4)

         cropland that is otherwise ineligible if the Secretary determines that—

            (A)

             if permitted to remain in agricultural production, the land would—

                (i) contribute to the degradation of soil, water, or air quality; or

                (ii) pose an on-site or off-site environmental threat to soil, water, or air quality;

            (B)

             the land is a—

                (i) newly-created, permanent grass sod waterway; or

                (ii) a contour grass sod strip established and maintained as part of an approved conservation plan;

            (C) the land will be devoted to newly established living snow fences, permanent wildlife habitat, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or filterstrips or riparian buffers devoted to trees, shrubs, or grasses;

            (D) the land poses an off-farm environmental threat, or a threat of continued degradation of productivity due to soil salinity, if permitted to remain in production; or

            (E) enrollment of the land would facilitate a net savings in groundwater or surface water resources of the agricultural operation of the producer; or

        (5)

         the portion of land in a field not enrolled in the conservation reserve in a case in which—

            (A) more than 50 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a buffer or filterstrip, or more than 75 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a conservation practice other than as a buffer or filterstrip; and

            (B)

             the remainder of the field is—

                (i) infeasible to farm; and

                (ii) enrolled at regular rental rates.

    (c) __Planting status of certain land__ 

        For purposes of determining the eligibility of land to be placed in the conservation reserve established under this subpart, land shall be considered to be planted to an agricultural commodity during a crop year if, during the crop year, the land was devoted to a conserving use.

    (d) __Enrollment__ 

        (1) __Maximum acreage enrolled__ 

        The Secretary may maintain in the conservation reserve at any one time during—

            (A) fiscal year 2014, no more than 27,500,000 acres;

            (B) fiscal year 2015, no more than 26,000,000 acres;

            (C) fiscal year 2016, no more than 25,000,000 acres;

            (D) fiscal year 2017, no more than 24,000,000 acres; and

            (E) fiscal year 2018, no more than 24,000,000 acres.

        (2) __Grasslands__ 

            (A) __Limitation__ 

                For purposes of applying the limitations in paragraph (1), no more than 2,000,000 acres of the land described in subsection (b)(3) may be enrolled in the program at any one time during the 2014 through 2018 fiscal years.

            (B) __Priority__ 

                In enrolling acres under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may give priority to land with expiring conservation reserve program contracts.

            (C) __Method of enrollment__ 

                In enrolling acres under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall make the program available to owners or operators of eligible land on a continuous enrollment basis with one or more ranking periods.

    (e) __Duration of contract__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For the purpose of carrying out this subpart, the Secretary shall enter into contracts of not less than 10, nor more than 15, years.

        (2) __Special rule for certain land__ 

            In the case of land devoted to hardwood trees, shelterbelts, windbreaks, or wildlife corridors under a contract entered into under this subpart, the owner or operator of the land may, within the limitations prescribed under paragraph (1), specify the duration of the contract.

    (f) __Conservation priority areas__ 

        (1) __Designation__ 

            On application by the appropriate State agency, the Secretary shall designate areas of special environmental sensitivity as conservation priority areas.

        (2) __Eligible areas__ 

            Areas eligible for designation under this subsection shall include areas with actual and significant adverse water quality or habitat impacts related to agricultural production activities.

        (3) __Expiration__ 

            Conservation priority area designation under this subsection shall expire after 5 years, subject to redesignation, except that the Secretary may withdraw an area’s designation if the Secretary finds that the area no longer contains actual and significant adverse water quality or habitat impacts related to agricultural production activities.

        (4) __Duty of Secretary__ 

            In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall attempt to maximize water quality and habitat benefits in the watersheds described in paragraph (1) by promoting a significant level of enrollment of land within the watersheds in the program under this subpart by whatever means the Secretary determines are appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this subpart.

    (g) __Multi-year grasses and legumes__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this subpart, alfalfa and other multi-year grasses and legumes in a rotation practice, approved by the Secretary, shall be considered agricultural commodities.

        (2) __Cropping history__ 

            Alfalfa, when grown as part of a rotation practice, as determined by the Secretary, is an agricultural commodity subject to the cropping history criteria under subsection (b)(1)(B) for the purpose of determining whether highly erodible cropland has been planted or considered planted for 4 of the 6 years referred to in such subsection.

    (h) __Eligibility for consideration__ 

        On the expiration of a contract entered into under this subpart, the land subject to the contract shall be eligible to be considered for reenrollment in the conservation reserve.

    (i) __Balance of natural resource purposes__ 

        In determining the acceptability of contract offers under this subpart, the Secretary shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, an equitable balance among the conservation purposes of soil erosion, water quality, and wildlife habitat.

>         “(C)

>             (i) the manner in which differential per acre payment rates potentially impact the types of land (by productivity) enrolled;

>             “(ii) changes to the per acre payment rates that may affect that impact; and

>             “(iii) the manner in which differential per acre payment rates could facilitate retention of productive agricultural land in agriculture; and
