            (B) __Applicability__ 

            Ineligibility under this subsection shall—

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraph (1), ineligibility for crop insurance premium assistance shall apply in accordance with this paragraph.

            (B) __New conversions__ 

            In the case of a wetland that the Secretary determines was converted after February 7, 2014—

                (i) the person shall be ineligible to receive crop insurance premium subsidies in subsequent reinsurance years unless the Secretary determines that an exemption pursuant to [section 3822 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3822] applies; or

                (ii) for any violation that the Secretary determines impacts less than 5 acres of an entire farm, the person may pay a contribution in an amount equal to 150 percent of the cost of mitigation, as determined by the Secretary, to the fund described in [section 3841(f) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3841/f] for wetland restoration in lieu of ineligibility to receive crop insurance premium assistance.

            In the case of an agricultural commodity for which an individual policy or plan of insurance is available for the first time to the person after February 7, 2014—

                (i) ineligibility shall apply only to conversions that take place after the date on which the policy or plan of insurance first becomes available to the person; and

        (3) __Limitations__

                Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a person subject to a final determination, including all administrative appeals, of a violation described in subsection (d) shall have 1 reinsurance year to initiate a mitigation plan to remedy the violation, as determined by the Secretary, before becoming ineligible under this subsection in the following reinsurance year to receive any payment of any portion of the premium paid by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act ([7 U.S.C. 1501][/us/usc/t7/s1501] et seq.).

            (B) __Persons covered for the first time__

            (C) __Good faith__ 

                If the Secretary determines that a person subject to a final determination, including all administrative appeals, of a violation described in this subsection acted in good faith and without intent to commit a violation described in this subsection as described in [section 3822(h) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3822/h], the person shall have 2 reinsurance years to take such steps as the Secretary determines appropriate to remedy or mitigate the violation in accordance with this subsection.

            (D) __Tenant relief__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If a tenant is determined to be ineligible for payments and other benefits under this subsection, the Secretary may limit the ineligibility only to the farm that is the basis for the ineligibility determination if the tenant has established, to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

                    (I) the tenant has made a good faith effort to meet the requirements of this section, including enlisting the assistance of the Secretary to obtain a reasonable plan for restoration or mitigation for the farm;

                    (II) the landlord on the farm refuses to comply with the plan on the farm; and

                    (III) the Secretary determines that the lack of compliance is not a part of a scheme or device to avoid the compliance.

                (ii) __Report__ 

                    The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate an annual report concerning the ineligibility determinations limited during the previous 12-month period under this subparagraph.

                (ii) __Timely evaluation__ 

                The Secretary shall evaluate the certification in a timely manner and—

                    (I) a person who has properly complied with certification shall be held harmless with regard to eligibility during the period of evaluation; and

                    (II) if the Secretary fails to evaluate the certification in a timely manner and the person is subsequently found to be in violation of this subsection, ineligibility shall not apply to the person for that violation.

                (iii) __Equitable contribution__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                    If a person fails to notify the Secretary as required and is subsequently found to be in violation of this subsection, the Secretary shall—

                    (II) __Limitation__ 

                        The contribution shall not exceed the total of the portion of the premium paid by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation for a policy or plan of insurance for all years the person is determined to have been in violation subsequent to the date on which certification was first required under this subparagraph.

                In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall use existing processes and procedures for certifying compliance.

            (B) __Responsibility__ 

                The Secretary, acting through the agencies of the Department of Agriculture, shall be solely responsible for determining whether a producer is eligible to receive crop insurance premium subsidies in accordance with this subsection.

    (d) __Wetland conversion__ 

        Except as provided in [section 3822 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3822] and notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who in any crop year beginning after November 28, 1990, converts a wetland by draining, dredging, filling, leveling, or any other means for the purpose, or to have the effect, of making the production of an agricultural commodity possible on such converted wetland shall be ineligible for those payments, loans, or programs specified in subsection (b) of this section for that crop year and all subsequent crop years.
