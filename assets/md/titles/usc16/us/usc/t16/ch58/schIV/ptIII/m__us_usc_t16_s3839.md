            (A) contains riparian corridors;

            (B) is an area of critical habitat for wildlife, especially threatened or endangered species; or

        (2) __Ineligible land__ 

        The Secretary may not acquire easements on—

            (A) land that contains timber stands established under the conservation reserve under this subchapter; or
