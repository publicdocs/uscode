## § 3851. Agriculture conservation experienced services program

    (a) __Establishment and purpose__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a conservation experienced services program (in this section referred to as the “ACES Program”) for the purpose of utilizing the talents of individuals who are age 55 or older, but who are not employees of the Department of Agriculture or a State agriculture department, to provide technical services in support of the conservation-related programs and authorities carried out by the Secretary. Such technical services may include conservation planning assistance, technical consultation, and assistance with design and implementation of conservation practices.

    (b) __Program agreements__ 

        (1) __Relation to older American community service employment program__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts, to carry out the ACES program during a fiscal year, the Secretary may enter into agreements with nonprofit private agencies and organizations eligible to receive grants for that fiscal year under the Community Service Senior Opportunities Act ([42 U.S.C. 3056][/us/usc/t42/s3056] et seq.) to secure participants for the ACES program who will provide technical services under the ACES program.

        (2) __Required determination__ 

        Before entering into an agreement under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that the agreement would not—

            (A) result in the displacement of individuals employed by the Department, including partial displacement through reduction of non-overtime hours, wages, or employment benefits;

            (B) result in the use of an individual under the ACES program for a job or function in a case in which a Federal employee is in a layoff status from the same or a substantially-equivalent job or function with the Department; or

            (C) affect existing contracts for services.

    (c) __Funding source__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may carry out the ACES program using funds made available to carry out each program under this chapter.

        (2) __Exclusion__ 

            Funds made available to carry out the conservation reserve program may not be used to carry out the ACES program.

    (d) __Liability__ 

    An individual providing technical services under the ACES program is deemed to be an employee of the United States Government for purposes of chapter 171 of title 28 if the individual—

        (1) is providing technical services pursuant to an agreement entered into under subsection (b); and

        (2) is acting within the scope of the agreement.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Community Service Senior Opportunities Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), is title V of [Pub. L. 89–73][/us/pl/89/73], as added [Pub. L. 109–365, title V][/us/pl/109/365/tV], § 501, Oct. 17, 2006, [120 Stat. 2563][/us/stat/120/2563], which is classified generally to subchapter IX (§ 3056 et seq.) of chapter 35 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 3001 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s3001] and Tables.

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (c)(1), was in the original “this title”, meaning title XII of [Pub. L. 99–198][/us/pl/99/198], which enacted this chapter and former [section 2005a of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2005a] and amended sections 590g, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009 of this title, sections 4207 and 4209 of Title 7, Agriculture, and provisions set out as a note under [section 1981 of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1981].

L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246], § 2710, which directed the amendment of subtitle F of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 by inserting this section after section 1251, was executed by inserting this section between subtitles E and G of title XII of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because subtitle F and section 1251 ([16 U.S.C. 2005a][/us/usc/t16/s2005a]) of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 were repealed by [Pub.
