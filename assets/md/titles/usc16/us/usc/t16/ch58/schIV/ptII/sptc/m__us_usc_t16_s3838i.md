            (B) __Landowner contribution__ 

                As part of the non-Federal share of the cost of purchasing a conservation easement or other interest in eligible land, an eligible entity may include a charitable donation or qualified conservation contribution (as defined by [section 170(h) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s170/h]) from the private landowner from which the conservation easement or other interest in land will be purchased.

    (d) __Determination of fair market value__ 

        Effective on the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, the fair market value of the conservation easement or other interest in eligible land shall be determined on the basis of an appraisal using an industry approved method, selected by the eligible entity and approved by the Secretary.

    (e) __Bidding down prohibited__ 

        If the Secretary determines that 2 or more applications for cost-share assistance are comparable in achieving the purpose of the program, the Secretary shall not assign a higher priority to any 1 of those applications solely on the basis of lesser cost to the program.

    (f) __Condition on assistance__ 

        (1) __Conservation plan__ 

            Any highly erodible cropland for which a conservation easement or other interest is purchased using cost-share assistance provided under the program shall be subject to a conservation plan that requires, at the option of the Secretary, the conversion of the cropland to less intensive uses.

        (2) __Contingent right of enforcement__ 

            The Secretary shall require the inclusion of a contingent right of enforcement for the Secretary in the terms of a conservation easement or other interest in eligible land that is purchased using cost-share assistance provided under the program.

        (4) __Minimum requirements__ 

        An eligible entity shall be authorized to use its own terms and conditions, as approved by the Secretary, for conservation easements and other purchases of interests in land, so long as such terms and conditions—

            (B) permit effective enforcement of the conservation purposes of such easements or other interests; and

            (C) include a limit on the impervious surfaces to be allowed that is consistent with the agricultural activities to be conducted.
