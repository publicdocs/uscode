        (3) in the case of a confined livestock feeding operation, provides for development and implementation of a comprehensive nutrient management plan, if applicable; and

        (4)

         in the case of forest land, is consistent with the provisions of a forest management plan that is approved by the Secretary, which may include—

        (2) to the maximum extent practicable, eliminate duplication of planning activities under the program under this part and comparable conservation programs.
