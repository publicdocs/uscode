        (2) __Scope of assistance available__ 

            (A) __Federal share__ 

            An agreement described in paragraph (4) shall provide for a Federal share determined by the Secretary of an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement, as determined by the Secretary using—

                (i) the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice;

                (ii) an areawide market analysis or survey; or

            (B) __Non-federal share__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Under the agreement, the eligible entity shall provide a share that is at least equivalent to that provided by the Secretary.

                (ii) __Source of contribution__ 

                    An eligible entity may include as part of its share under clause (i) a charitable donation or qualified conservation contribution (as defined by [section 170(h) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s170/h]) from the private landowner if the eligible entity contributes its own cash resources in an amount that is at least 50 percent of the amount contributed by the Secretary.

            (C) __Exception__ 

                (i) __Grasslands__ 

                    In the case of grassland of special environmental significance, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may provide an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement.

                (ii) __Cash contribution__ 

                    For purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii), the Secretary may waive any portion of the eligible entity cash contribution requirement for projects of special significance, subject to an increase in the private landowner donation that is equal to the amount of the waiver, if the donation is voluntary and the property is in active agricultural production.

            (C) __Bidding down__ 

                If the Secretary determines that 2 or more applications for cost-share assistance are comparable in achieving the purpose of the program, the Secretary shall not assign a higher priority to any of those applications solely on the basis of lesser cost to the program.
