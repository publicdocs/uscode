    (a) __In general__

        (2) identify not less than 5 priority resource concerns in a particular watershed or other appropriate region or area within a State; and

        (3) establish a science-based stewardship threshold for each priority resource concern identified under paragraph (2).

    (b) __Allocation to States__ 

    The Secretary shall allocate acres to States for enrollment, based—

        (1) primarily on each State’s proportion of eligible land to the total acreage of eligible land in all States; and

        (2)

         also on consideration of—

            (A) the extent and magnitude of the conservation needs associated with agricultural production in each State;

            (B) the degree to which implementation of the program in the State is, or will be, effective in helping producers address those needs; and

            (C) other considerations to achieve equitable geographic distribution of funds, as determined by the Secretary.

    (c) __Acreage enrollment limitation__ 

    During the period beginning on February 7, 2014, and ending on September 30, 2022, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable—

        (1) enroll in the program an additional 10,000,000 acres for each fiscal year; and

            (B) Income forgone by the producer.

            (C) Expected conservation benefits.

        (4) __Delivery of payments__ 

        In making payments under this subsection, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable—

            (A) prorate conservation performance over the term of the contract so as to accommodate, to the extent practicable, producers earning equal annual payments in each fiscal year; and

    (e) __Supplemental payments for resource-conserving crop rotations__ 

        (1) __Availability of payments__

        (2) __Beneficial crop rotations__ 

            The Secretary shall determine whether a resource-conserving crop rotation is a beneficial crop rotation eligible for additional payments under paragraph (1) based on whether the resource-conserving crop rotation is designed to provide natural resource conservation and production benefits.

        (3) __Eligibility__ 

            To be eligible to receive a payment described in paragraph (1), a producer shall agree to adopt and maintain beneficial resource-conserving crop rotations for the term of the contract.

        (4) __Resource-conserving crop rotation__
