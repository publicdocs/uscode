                    In making cost share payments to an owner or operator of land described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the owner or operator for maintaining trees or shrubs, including the cost of replanting (if the trees or shrubs were lost due to conditions beyond the control of the owner or operator).

        (5) __Other Federal cost share assistance__

            In determining the amount of annual rental payments to be paid to owners and operators for converting highly erodible cropland or other eligible lands normally devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity to less intensive use, the Secretary may consider, among other things, the amount necessary to encourage owners or operators of highly erodible cropland or other eligible lands to participate in the program established by this subpart.

        (2) __Methods of determination__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amounts payable to owners or operators in the form of rental payments under contracts entered into under this subpart may be determined through—

        (3) __Acceptance of contract offers__ 

            (A) __Evaluation of offers__

            (B) __Establishment of different criteria in various States and regions__ 

                The Secretary may establish different criteria for determining the acceptability of contract offers in various States and regions of the United States based on the extent to which water quality or wildlife habitat may be improved or erosion may be abated.

                In determining the acceptability of contract offers for new enrollments, the Secretary shall accept, to the maximum extent practicable, an offer from an owner or operator that is a resident of the county in which the land is located or of a contiguous county if, as determined by the Secretary, the land would provide at least equivalent conservation benefits to land under competing offers.

        (4) __Hardwood tree acreage__ 

            In the case of acreage enrolled in the conservation reserve established under this subpart that is to be devoted to hardwood trees, the Secretary may consider bids for contracts under this subsection on a continuous basis.

        (5) __Rental rates__ 

            (A) __Annual estimates__ 

                The Secretary (acting through the National Agricultural Statistics Service) shall, not less frequently than once every other year, conduct a survey of per acre estimates of county average market dryland and irrigated cash rental rates for cropland and pastureland in all counties or equivalent subdivisions within each State that have 20,000 acres or more of cropland and pastureland.

            (B) __Public availability of estimates__ 

                The estimates derived from the survey conducted under subparagraph (A) shall be maintained on a website of the Department of Agriculture for use by the general public.

            (C) __Use__
