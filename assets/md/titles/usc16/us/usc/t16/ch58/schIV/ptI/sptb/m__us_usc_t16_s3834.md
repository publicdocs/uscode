    (a) __Timing__

        (2)

         with respect to any annual rental payment obligation incurred by the Secretary—

            (A) as soon as practicable after October 1 of each calendar year; or

            (B) at the option of the Secretary, at any time prior to such date during the year that the obligation is incurred.

    (b) __Federal percentage of cost sharing payments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In making cost sharing payments to an owner or operator under a contract entered into under this subpart, the Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the cost of establishing water quality and conservation measures and practices required under each contract for which the Secretary determines that cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            The Secretary shall not make any payment to an owner or operator under this subpart to the extent that the total amount of cost sharing payments provided to the owner or operator from all sources would exceed 100 percent of the total cost of establishing measures and practices described in paragraph (1).

        (3) __Trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors__ 

            (A) __Applicability__ 

            This paragraph applies to—

                (i) land devoted to the production of hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, or wildlife corridors under a contract entered into under this subpart after November 28, 1990;

                (ii) land converted to such production under [section 3835a of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3835a]; and

                (iii) land on which an owner or operator agrees to conduct thinning authorized by [section 3832(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3832/a/9], if the thinning is necessary to improve the condition of resources on the land.

            (B) __Payments__ 

                (i) __Percentage__ 

                    In making cost share payments to an owner or operator of land described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the owner or operator for maintaining trees or shrubs, including the cost of replanting (if the trees or shrubs were lost due to conditions beyond the control of the owner or operator) or thinning.

                (ii) __Duration__ 

                The Secretary shall make payments as described in clause (i) for a period of not less than 2 years, but not more than 4 years, beginning on the date of—

                    (I) the planting of the trees or shrubs; or

                    (II) the thinning of existing stands to improve the condition of resources on the land.

        (4) __Hardwood tree planting__ 

            The Secretary may permit owners or operators that contract to devote at least 10 acres of land to the production of hardwood trees under this subpart to extend the planting of the trees over a 3-year period if at least ⅓ of the trees are planted in each of the first 2 years.

        (5) __Other Federal cost share assistance__ 

            An owner or operator shall not be eligible to receive or retain cost share assistance under this subsection if the owner or operator receives any other Federal cost share assistance with respect to the land under any other provision of law.

    (c) __Annual rental payments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In determining the amount of annual rental payments to be paid to owners and operators for converting highly erodible cropland normally devoted to the production of an agricultural commodity to less intensive use, the Secretary may consider, among other things, the amount necessary to encourage owners or operators of highly erodible cropland to participate in the program established by this subpart.

        (2) __Method of determination__ 

        The amounts payable to owners or operators in the form of rental payments under contracts entered into under this subpart may be determined through—

            (A) the submission of bids for such contracts by owners and operators in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe; or

            (B) such other means as the Secretary determines are appropriate.

        (3) __Acceptance of contract offers__ 

            (A) __Evaluation of offers__ 

                In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary may take into consideration the extent to which enrollment of the land that is the subject of the contract offer would improve soil resources, water quality, or wildlife habitat or provide other environmental benefits.

            (B) __Establishment of different criteria in various States and regions__ 

                The Secretary may establish different criteria for determining the acceptability of contract offers in various States and regions of the United States based on the extent to which water quality or wildlife habitat may be improved or erosion may be abated.

            (C) __Local preference__ 

                In determining the acceptability of contract offers for new enrollments, the Secretary shall accept, to the maximum extent practicable, an offer from an owner or operator that is a resident of the county in which the land is located or of a contiguous county if, as determined by the Secretary, the land would provide at least equivalent conservation benefits to land under competing offers.

        (4) __Hardwood tree acreage__ 

            In the case of acreage enrolled in the conservation reserve established under this subpart that is to be devoted to hardwood trees, the Secretary may consider bids for contracts under this subsection on a continuous basis.

        (5) __Rental rates__ 

            (A) __Annual estimates__ 

                The Secretary (acting through the National Agricultural Statistics Service) shall conduct an annual survey of per acre estimates of county average market dryland and irrigated cash rental rates for cropland and pastureland in all counties or equivalent subdivisions within each State that have 20,000 acres or more of cropland and pastureland.

            (B) __Public availability of estimates__ 

                The estimates derived from the annual survey conducted under subparagraph (A) shall be maintained on a website of the Department of Agriculture for use by the general public.

    (d) __Cash or in-kind payments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this section, payments under this subpart—

            (A) shall be made in cash or in commodities in such amount and on such time schedule as is agreed on and specified in the contract; and

            (B) may be made in advance of determination of performance.

        (2) __Method of providing in-kind payments__ 

        If the payment to an owner or operator is made with in-kind commodities, the payment shall be made by the Commodity Credit Corporation—

            (A) by delivery of the commodity involved to the owner or operator at a warehouse or other similar facility located in the county in which the highly erodible cropland is located or at such other location as is agreed to by the Secretary and the owner or operator;

            (B) by the transfer of negotiable warehouse receipts; or

            (C) by such other method, including the sale of the commodity in commercial markets, as is determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to enable the owner or operator to receive efficient and expeditious possession of the commodity.

        (3) __Cash payments__ 

            (A) __Commodity Credit Corporation stocks__ 

                If stocks of a commodity acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation are not readily available to make full payment in kind to the owner or operator, the Secretary may substitute full or partial payment in cash for payment in kind.

            (B) __Special conservation reserve enhancement program__ 

                Payments to an owner or operator under a special conservation reserve enhancement program described in subsection (f)(4) of this section shall be in the form of cash only.

    (e) __Payments on death, disability, or succession__ 

        If an owner or operator that is entitled to a payment under a contract entered into under this subpart dies, becomes incompetent, is otherwise unable to receive the payment, or is succeeded by another person that renders or completes the required performance, the Secretary shall make the payment, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary and without regard to any other provision of law, in such manner as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

    (f) __Payment limitation for rental payments__
