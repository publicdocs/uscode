## § 3837c. Duties of Secretary

    (a) __In general__ 

    In return for the granting of an easement by an owner under this subpart, the Secretary shall—

        (1) share the cost of carrying out the establishment of conservation measures and practices, and the protection of the wetland functions and values, including necessary maintenance activities, as set forth in the plan to the extent that the Secretary determines that cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest; and

        (2) provide necessary technical assistance to assist owners in complying with the terms and conditions of the easement and the plan.

    (b) __Cost-share and technical assistance__ 

        (1) __Easements__ 

        Effective beginning October 1, 1996, in making cost-share payments under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall—

            (A) in the case of a permanent easement, pay the owner an amount that is not less than 75 percent, but not more than 100 percent, of the eligible costs; and

            (B) in the case of a 30-year easement, pay the owner an amount that is not less than 50 percent, but not more than 75 percent, of the eligible costs.

        (2) __Restoration cost-share agreements__ 

            In making cost-share payments in connection with a restoration cost-share agreement entered into under section 3837a(h)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, the Secretary shall pay the owner an amount that is not less than 50 percent, but not more than 75 percent, of the eligible costs.

        (3) __Technical assistance__ 

            The Secretary shall provide owners with technical assistance to assist owners in complying with the terms of easements and restoration cost-share agreements.

    (c) __Ranking of offers__ 

        (1) __Conservation benefits and funding considerations__ 

        When evaluating offers from landowners, the Secretary may consider—

            (A) the conservation benefits of obtaining an easement or other interest in the land;

            (B) the cost-effectiveness of each easement or other interest in eligible land, so as to maximize the environmental benefits per dollar expended; and

            (C) whether the landowner or another person is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds.

        (2) __Additional considerations__ 

        In determining the acceptability of easement offers, the Secretary may take into consideration—

            (A) the extent to which the purposes of the easement program would be achieved on the land;

            (B) the productivity of the land; and

            (C) the on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities.

    (d) __Easement priority__ 

        In carrying out this subpart, to the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, the Secretary shall give priority to obtaining permanent conservation easements before shorter term conservation easements and, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall place priority on acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.
