## § 3838e. Conservation stewardship program

    (a) __Establishment and purpose__ 

    During each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the Secretary shall carry out a conservation stewardship program to encourage producers to address priority resource concerns and improve and conserve the quality and condition of natural resources in a comprehensive manner—

        (1) by undertaking additional conservation activities; and

        (2) by improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities.

    (b) __Exclusions__ 

        (1) __Land enrolled in other conservation programs__ 

        Subject to paragraph (2), the following land (even if covered by the definition of eligible land) is not eligible for enrollment in the program:

            (A)

             Land enrolled in the conservation reserve program, unless—

                (i) the conservation reserve contract will expire at the end of the fiscal year in which the land is to be enrolled in the program; and

                (ii) conservation reserve program payments for land enrolled in the program cease before the first program payment is made to the applicant under this subpart.

            (B) Land enrolled in a wetland reserve easement through the agricultural conservation easement program.

            (C) Land enrolled in the conservation security program.

        (2) __Conversion to cropland__ 

        Eligible land used for crop production after February 7, 2014, that had not been planted, considered to be planted, or devoted to crop production for at least 4 of the 6 years preceding that date shall not be the basis for any payment under the program, unless the land does not meet such requirement because—

            (A) the land had previously been enrolled in the conservation reserve program;

            (B) the land has been maintained using long-term crop rotation practices, as determined by the Secretary; or

            (C) the land is incidental land needed for efficient operation of the farm or ranch, as determined by the Secretary.
