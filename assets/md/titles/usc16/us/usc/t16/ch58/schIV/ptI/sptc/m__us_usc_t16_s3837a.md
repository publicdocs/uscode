## § 3837a. Easements and agreements

    (a) __In general__ 

    To be eligible to place land into the wetland reserve under this subpart, the owner of such land shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary—

        (1) to grant an easement on such land to the Secretary;

        (2) to implement a wetland easement conservation plan as provided for in this section;

        (3) to create and record an appropriate deed restriction in accordance with applicable State law to reflect the easement agreed to under this subpart with respect to such lands; and

        (4) to provide a written statement of consent to such easement signed by those holding a security interest in the land.

    (b) __Terms of easement__ 

    An owner granting an easement under subsection (a) of this section shall be required to provide for the restoration and protection of the functional values of wetland pursuant to a wetland easement conservation plan that—

        (1)

         permits—

            (A) repairs, improvements, and inspections on such land that are necessary to maintain existing public drainage systems if such land is subsequently restored to the condition required by the terms of the easement; and

            (B) landowners to control public access on the easement areas while identifying access routes to be used for wetland restoration activities and management and easement monitoring;

        (2)

         prohibits—

            (A) the alteration of wildlife habitat and other natural features of such land, unless specifically permitted by the plan;

            (B)

             the spraying of such land with chemicals or the mowing of such land, except where such spraying or mowing is permitted by the plan or is necessary—

                (i) to comply with Federal or State noxious weed control laws;

                (ii) to comply with a Federal or State emergency pest treatment program; or

                (iii) to meet habitat needs of specific wildlife species; and

            (C) any activities to be carried out on such participating landowner’s or successor’s land that is immediately adjacent to, and functionally related to, the land that is subject to the easement if such activities will alter, degrade, or otherwise diminish the functional value of the eligible land; and

            (D) the adoption of any other practice that would tend to defeat the purposes of this subpart, as determined by the Secretary;

        (3) provides for the efficient and effective restoration of the functional values of wetlands; and

        (4) includes such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable to carry out this subpart or to facilitate the practical administration thereof.

    (c) __Restoration plans__ 

        The development of a restoration plan, including any compatible use, under this section shall be made through the local Natural Resources Conservation Service representative, in consultation with the State technical committee.

    (d) __Compatible uses__ 

        Wetland reserve program lands may be used for compatible economic uses, including such activities as hunting and fishing, managed timber harvest, or periodic haying or grazing, if such use is specifically permitted by the plan and consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetlands resources for which the easement was established.

    (e) __Type and length of easement__ 

    A conservation easement granted under this section—

        (1) shall be in a recordable form; and

        (2) shall be for 30 years, permanent, or the maximum duration allowed under applicable State laws.

    (f) __Compensation__ 

        (1) __Determination__ 

        Effective on the date of the enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, the Secretary shall pay as compensation for a conservation easement acquired under this subpart the lowest of—

            (A) the fair market value of the land, as determined by the Secretary, using the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices or an area-wide market analysis or survey;

            (B) the amount corresponding to a geographical cap, as determined by the Secretary in regulations; or

            (C) the offer made by the landowner.

        (2) __Form of payment__ 

            Compensation for an easement shall be provided by the Secretary in the form of a cash payment, in an amount determined under paragraph (1) and specified in the easement agreement.

        (3) __Payment schedule for easements__ 

            (A) __Easements valued at $500,000 or less__ 

                For easements valued at $500,000 or less, the Secretary may provide easement payments in not more than 30 annual payments.

            (B) __Easements in excess of $500,000__ 

                For easements valued at more than $500,000, the Secretary may provide easement payments in at least 5, but not more than 30 annual payments, except that, if the Secretary determines it would further the purposes of the program, the Secretary may make a lump sum payment for such an easement.

        (4) __Restoration agreement payment limitation__ 

            Payments made to a person or legal entity, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a restoration cost-share agreement under this subpart may not exceed, in the aggregate, $50,000 per year.

        (5) __Enrollment procedure__ 

            Lands may be enrolled under this subpart through the submission of bids under a procedure established by the Secretary.

    (g) __Violation__ 

        On the violation of the terms or conditions of the easement or related agreement entered into under subsection (a) of this section, the easement shall remain in force and the Secretary may require the owner to refund all or part of any payments received by the owner under this subpart, together with interest thereon as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

    (h) __Wetlands reserve enhancement program__ 

        (1) __Program authorized__ 

            The Secretary may enter into 1 or more agreements with a State (including a political subdivision or agency of a State), nongovernmental organization, or Indian tribe to carry out a special wetlands reserve enhancement program that the Secretary determines would advance the purposes of this subpart.

        (2) __Reserved rights pilot program__ 

            (A) __Reservation of grazing rights__ 

            As part of the wetlands reserve enhancement program, the Secretary shall carry out a pilot program for land in which a landowner may reserve grazing rights in the warranty easement deed restriction if the Secretary determines that the reservation and use of the grazing rights—

                (i) is compatible with the land subject to the easement;

                (ii) is consistent with the long-term wetland protection and enhancement goals for which the easement was established; and

                (iii) complies with a conservation plan.

            (B) __Duration__ 

                The pilot program established under this paragraph shall terminate on September 30, 2012.
