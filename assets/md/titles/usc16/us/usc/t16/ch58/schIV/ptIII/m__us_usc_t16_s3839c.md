    (a) __Time of payment__ 

    The Secretary shall provide payment for obligations incurred by the Secretary under this part—

        (2) with respect to any annual easement payment obligation incurred by the Secretary as soon as possible after October 1 of each calendar year.

    (b) __Cost sharing payments__ 

        In making cost sharing payments to owners under this part, the Secretary may pay up to 100 percent of the cost of establishing conservation measures and practices pursuant to this part.

    (c) __Easement payments; acceptability of offers__ 

        (1) __Determination of amount__ 

            The Secretary shall determine the amount payable to owners in the form of easement payments under this part, and in making such determination may consider, among other things, the amount necessary to encourage owners to participate in the easement program.

        (2) __Acceptability of offers__ 

        In determining the acceptability of easement offers, the Secretary may take into consideration—

            (A) the extent to which the purposes of the easement program would be achieved on the land;

            (B) the productivity of the land; and

            (C) the on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities.

    (d) __Form of payment__ 

    Except as otherwise provided in this section, payments under this part—

        (1) shall be made in cash in such amount and at such time as is agreed on and specified in the easement or related agreement; and

        (2) may be made in advance of a determination of performance.

    (e) __Payments to others__ 

        If an owner who is entitled to a payment under this part dies, becomes incompetent, is otherwise unable to receive such payment, or is succeeded by another person who renders or completes the required performance, the Secretary shall make such payment, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary and without regard to any other provision of law, in such manner as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

    (f) __Payment limitation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The total amount of easement payments made to a person under this part for any year may not exceed $50,000.

        (2) __Regulations__ 

            The Secretary shall issue regulations prescribing such rules as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure a fair and reasonable application of the limitation contained in this subsection.

        (3) __Other payments__ 

            Easement payments received by an owner shall be in addition to, and not affect, the total amount of payments that such owner is otherwise eligible to receive under this Act, the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, or the Agricultural Act of 1949 ([7 U.S.C. 1421][/us/usc/t7/s1421] et seq.).

The Secretary may enter into such agreements for payments to States, political subdivisions, or agencies thereof that the Secretary determines will advance the purposes of this part.
