## § 757e. Application to Columbia River basin

    Sections 757a to 757f of this title shall not be construed to affect, modify, or apply to the same area as the provisions of sections 755 to 757 of this title. The State of Idaho shall be eligible on an equal standing with other States for Federal funding for purposes authorized by sections 757a to 757f of this title.

([Pub. L. 89–304, § 5][/us/pl/89/304/s5], Oct. 30, 1965, [79 Stat. 1126][/us/stat/79/1126]; [Pub. L. 98–146, title I][/us/pl/98/146], Nov. 4, 1983, [97 Stat. 922][/us/stat/97/922].)

 __Codification__ 

    Although the intent of Congress to amend this section is clear from the directory language of [Pub. L. 98–146][/us/pl/98/146] which states that the sentence relating to the eligibility of the State of Idaho be added to “[16 U.S.C. 757e][/us/usc/t16/s757e]”, that directory language has been editorially interpreted as directing the addition of that sentence to [section 5 of Pub. L. 89–304][/us/pl/89/304/s5], because Title 16 of the United States Code \[this title\] has never been enacted into positive law and its sections are therefore not susceptible of amendment as sections of “16 U.S.C.—” and because [section 5 of Pub. L. 89–304][/us/pl/89/304/s5] is the statute which was classified to, and serves as the source for [16 U.S.C. 757e][/us/usc/t16/s757e] \[this section\].

 __Amendments__ 

    1983—[Pub. L. 98–146][/us/pl/98/146] inserted provision that the State of Idaho shall be eligible on an equal standing with other States for Federal funding for purposes authorized by sections 757a to 757f of this title.
