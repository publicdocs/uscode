The amount of the civil penalty shall be consistent with the amount under [section 1858(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1858/a].

            (B) __Compromise or other action by secretary__

        (3) __Action upon failure to pay assessment__ 

            If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty under this chapter after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.

    (c) __Forfeiture__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any foreign vessel (including its fishing gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used, and any fish (or the fair market value thereof) imported or possessed in connection with or as result of the commission of any act prohibited by [section 7406 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7406] shall be subject to forfeiture under [section 1860 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1860].

For seizures and forfeitures of property under this section by the Secretary, such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of property under the customs law may be performed by such officers as are designated by the Secretary or, upon request of the Secretary, by any other agency that has authority to manage and dispose of seized property.

        (3) __Presumption__
