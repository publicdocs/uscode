 __References in Text__ 

    The Act of Congress known as the Reclamation Act, approved June 17, 1902, referred to in subsec.

For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 371 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s371] and Tables. The reclamation fund created by that Act was established by [section 391 of Title 43][/us/usc/t43/s391].
