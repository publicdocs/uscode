## § 824m. Sales by exempt wholesale generators

    No rate or charge received by an exempt wholesale generator for the sale of electric energy shall be lawful under [section 824d of this title][/us/usc/t16/s824d] if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that such rate or charge results from the receipt of any undue preference or advantage from an electric utility which is an associate company or an affiliate of the exempt wholesale generator. For purposes of this section, the terms “associate company” and “affiliate” shall have the same meaning as provided in [section 16451 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s16451]. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

([June 10, 1920, ch. 285][/us/act/1920-06-10/ch285], pt. II, § 214, as added [Pub. L. 102–486, title VII, § 724][/us/pl/102/486/s724], Oct. 24, 1992, [106 Stat. 2920][/us/stat/106/2920]; amended [Pub. L. 109–58, title XII, § 1277(b)(2)][/us/pl/109/58/s1277/b/2], Aug. 8, 2005, [119 Stat. 978][/us/stat/119/978].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 16451 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s16451], referred to in text, was in the original “section 2(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005” and was translated as reading “section 1262” of that Act, meaning section 1262 of subtitle F of title XII of [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because subtitle F of title XII of [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] does not contain a section 2 and section 1262 of subtitle F of title XII of [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] defines terms.

 __Amendments__ 

    2005—[Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] substituted “[section 16451 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s16451]” for “[section 79b(a) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s79b/a]”.

 __Effective Date of 2005 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] effective 6 months after Aug. 8, 2005, with provisions relating to effect of compliance with certain regulations approved and made effective prior to such date, see [section 1274 of Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58/s1274], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 16451 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s16451], The Public Health and Welfare.

 __State Authorities; Construction__ 

    Nothing in this section to be construed as affecting or intending to affect, or in any way to interfere with, authority of any State or local government relating to environmental protection or siting of facilities, see [section 731 of Pub. L. 102–486][/us/pl/102/486/s731], set out as a note under [section 796 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s796].
