## § 825m. Enforcement provisions

    (a) __Enjoining and restraining violations__ 

        Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper District Court of the United States or the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or decree or restraining order shall be granted without bond. The Commission may transmit such evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices to the Attorney General, who, in his discretion, may institute the necessary criminal proceedings under this chapter.

    (b) __Writs of mandamus__ 

        Upon application of the Commission the district courts of the United States and the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission thereunder.

    (c) __Employment of attorneys__ 

        The Commission may employ such attorneys as it finds necessary for proper legal aid and service of the Commission or its members in the conduct of their work, or for proper representation of the public interests in investigations made by it or cases or proceedings pending before it, whether at the Commission’s own instance or upon complaint, or to appear for or represent the Commission in any case in court; and the expenses of such employment shall be paid out of the appropriation for the Commission.

    (d) __Prohibitions on violators__ 

    In any proceedings under subsection (a), the court may prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or for such period of time as the court determines, any individual who is engaged or has engaged in practices constituting a violation of [section 824u of this title][/us/usc/t16/s824u] (and related rules and regulations) from—

        (1) acting as an officer or director of an electric utility; or

([June 10, 1920, ch. 285][/us/act/1920-06-10/ch285], pt. III, § 314, as added [Aug. 26, 1935, ch. 687][/us/act/1935-08-26/ch687], title II, § 213, [49 Stat. 861][/us/stat/49/861]; amended [June 25, 1936, ch. 804][/us/act/1936-06-25/ch804], [49 Stat. 1921][/us/stat/49/1921]; [June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 32(b)][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646/s32/b], [62 Stat. 991][/us/stat/62/991]; [May 24, 1949, ch. 139, § 127][/us/act/1949-05-24/ch139/s127], [63 Stat. 107][/us/stat/63/107]; [Pub. L. 109–58, title XII, § 1288][/us/pl/109/58/s1288], Aug. 8, 2005, [119 Stat. 982][/us/stat/119/982].)

 __Codification__ 

    As originally enacted subsecs. (a) and (b) contained references to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act June 25, 1936, substituted “the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia” for “the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia”, and act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” for “district court of the United States for the District of Columbia”. However, the words “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of [section 132(a) of Title 28][/us/usc/t28/s132/a], Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that “There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district”, and [section 88 of Title 28][/us/usc/t28/s88] which states that “the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district”.

 __Amendments__ 

    2005—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 109–58][/us/pl/109/58] added subsec. (d).
