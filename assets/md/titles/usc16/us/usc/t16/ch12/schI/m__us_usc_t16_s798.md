    (b) __Extension of period__ 

        The Commission may extend the period of a preliminary permit once for not more than 2 additional years beyond the 3 years permitted by subsection (a) if the Commission finds that the permittee has carried out activities under such permit in good faith and with reasonable diligence.

    (c) __Permit conditions__ 

        Each such permit shall set forth the conditions under which priority shall be maintained.

    (d) __Non-transferability and cancellation of permits__ 

        Such permits shall not be transferable, and may be canceled by order of the Commission upon failure of permittees to comply with the conditions thereof or for other good cause shown after notice and opportunity for hearing.
