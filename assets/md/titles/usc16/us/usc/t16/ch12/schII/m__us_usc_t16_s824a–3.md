## § 824a–3. Cogeneration and small power production

    (a) __Cogeneration and small power production rules__ 

    Not later than 1 year after November 9, 1978, the Commission shall prescribe, and from time to time thereafter revise, such rules as it determines necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production, and to encourage geothermal small power production facilities of not more than 80 megawatts capacity, which rules require electric utilities to offer to—

        (1) sell electric energy to qualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power production facilities  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup>  and

        (2) purchase electric energy from such facilities.

        Such rules shall be prescribed, after consultation with representatives of Federal and State regulatory agencies having ratemaking authority for electric utilities, and after public notice and a reasonable opportunity for interested persons (including State and Federal agencies) to submit oral as well as written data, views, and arguments. Such rules shall include provisions respecting minimum reliability of qualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power production facilities (including reliability of such facilities during emergencies) and rules respecting reliability of electric energy service to be available to such facilities from electric utilities during emergencies. Such rules may not authorize a qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility to make any sale for purposes other than resale.

    (b) __Rates for purchases by electric utilities__ 

    The rules prescribed under subsection (a) shall insure that, in requiring any electric utility to offer to purchase electric energy from any qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility, the rates for such purchase—

        (1) shall be just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility and in the public interest, and

        (2) shall not discriminate against qualifying cogenerators or qualifying small power producers.

        No such rule prescribed under subsection (a) shall provide for a rate which exceeds the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy.

    (c) __Rates for sales by utilities__ 

    The rules prescribed under subsection (a) shall insure that, in requiring any electric utility to offer to sell electric energy to any qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility, the rates for such sale—

        (1) shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest, and

        (2) shall not discriminate against the qualifying cogenerators or qualifying small power producers.

    (d) __“Incremental cost of alternative electric energy” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “incremental cost of alternative electric energy” means, with respect to electric energy purchased from a qualifying cogenerator or qualifying small power producer, the cost to the electric utility of the electric energy which, but for the purchase from such cogenerator or small power producer, such utility would generate or purchase from another source.

    (e) __Exemptions__ 

        (1) Not later than 1 year after November 9, 1978, and from time to time thereafter, the Commission shall, after consultation with representatives of State regulatory authorities, electric utilities, owners of cogeneration facilities and owners of small power production facilities, and after public notice and a reasonable opportunity for interested persons (including State and Federal agencies) to submit oral as well as written data, views, and arguments, prescribe rules under which geothermal small power production facilities of not more than 80 megawatts capacity, qualifying cogeneration facilities, and qualifying small power production facilities are exempted in whole or part from the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\], from the Public Utility Holding Company Act, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  from State laws and regulations respecting the rates, or respecting the financial or organizational regulation, of electric utilities, or from any combination of the foregoing, if the Commission determines such exemption is necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production.

        (2) No qualifying small power production facility (other than a qualifying small power production facility which is an eligible solar, wind, waste, or geothermal facility as defined in section 3(17)(E) of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 796(17)(E)][/us/usc/t16/s796/17/E]\]) which has a power production capacity which, together with any other facilities located at the same site (as determined by the Commission), exceeds 30 megawatts, or 80 megawatts for a qualifying small power production facility using geothermal energy as the primary energy source, may be exempted under rules under paragraph (1) from any provision of law or regulation referred to in paragraph (1), except that any qualifying small power production facility which produces electric energy solely by the use of biomass as a primary energy source, may be exempted by the Commission under such rules from the Public Utility Holding Company Act 2 and from State laws and regulations referred to in such paragraph (1).

        (3)

         No qualifying small power production facility or qualifying cogeneration facility may be exempted under this subsection from—

            (A) any State law or regulation in effect in a State pursuant to subsection (f),

            (B) the provisions of section 210, 211, or 212 of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 824i][/us/usc/t16/s824i], 824j, or 824k\] or the necessary authorities for enforcement of any such provision under the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\], or

            (C) any license or permit requirement under part I of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\] any provision under such Act related to such a license or permit requirement, or the necessary authorities for enforcement of any such requirement.

    (f) __Implementation of rules for qualifying cogeneration and qualifying small power production facilities__ 

        (1) Beginning on or before the date one year after any rule is prescribed by the Commission under subsection (a) or revised under such subsection, each State regulatory authority shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, implement such rule (or revised rule) for each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority.

        (2) Beginning on or before the date one year after any rule is prescribed by the Commission under subsection (a) or revised under such subsection, each nonregulated electric utility shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, implement such rule (or revised rule).

    (g) __Judicial review and enforcement__ 

        (1) Judicial review may be obtained respecting any proceeding conducted by a State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility for purposes of implementing any requirement of a rule under subsection (a) in the same manner, and under the same requirements, as judicial review may be obtained under [section 2633 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2633] in the case of a proceeding to which [section 2633 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2633] applies.

        (2) Any person (including the Secretary) may bring an action against any electric utility, qualifying small power producer, or qualifying cogenerator to enforce any requirement established by a State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility pursuant to subsection (f). Any such action shall be brought only in the manner, and under the requirements, as provided under [section 2633 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2633] with respect to an action to which [section 2633 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2633] applies.

    (h) __Commission enforcement__ 

        (1) For purposes of enforcement of any rule prescribed by the Commission under subsection (a) with respect to any operations of an electric utility, a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under part II of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 824][/us/usc/t16/s824] et seq.\], such rule shall be treated as a rule under the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\]. Nothing in subsection (g) shall apply to so much of the operations of an electric utility, a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility as are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under part II of the Federal Power Act.

        (2)

            (A)

             The Commission may enforce the requirements of subsection (f) against any State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility. For purposes of any such enforcement, the requirements of subsection (f)(1) shall be treated as a rule enforceable under the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\]. For purposes of any such action, a State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility shall be treated as a person within the meaning of the Federal Power Act. No enforcement action may be brought by the Commission under this section other than—

                (i) an action against the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility for failure to comply with the requirements of subsection (f)  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup>  or

                (ii) an action under paragraph (1).

            (B) Any electric utility, qualifying cogenerator, or qualifying small power producer may petition the Commission to enforce the requirements of subsection (f) as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. If the Commission does not initiate an enforcement action under subparagraph (A) against a State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility within 60 days following the date on which a petition is filed under this subparagraph with respect to such authority, the petitioner may bring an action in the appropriate United States district court to require such State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility to comply with such requirements, and such court may issue such injunctive or other relief as may be appropriate. The Commission may intervene as a matter of right in any such action.

    (i) __Federal contracts__ 

        No contract between a Federal agency and any electric utility for the sale of electric energy by such Federal agency for resale which is entered into after November 9, 1978, may contain any provision which will have the effect of preventing the implementation of any rule under this section with respect to such utility. Any provision in any such contract which has such effect shall be null and void.

    (j) __New dams and diversions__ 

    Except for a hydroelectric project located at a Government dam (as defined in section 3(10) of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 796(10)][/us/usc/t16/s796/10]\]) at which non-Federal hydroelectric development is permissible, this section shall not apply to any hydroelectric project which impounds or diverts the water of a natural watercourse by means of a new dam or diversion unless the project meets each of the following requirements:

        (1) __No substantial adverse effects__ 

            At the time of issuance of the license or exemption for the project, the Commission finds that the project will not have substantial adverse effects on the environment, including recreation and water quality. Such finding shall be made by the Commission after taking into consideration terms and conditions imposed under either paragraph (3) of this subsection or section 10 of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 803][/us/usc/t16/s803]\] (whichever is appropriate as required by that Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\] or the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986) and compliance with other environmental requirements applicable to the project.

        (2) __Protected rivers__ 

        At the time the application for a license or exemption for the project is accepted by the Commission (in accordance with the Commission’s regulations and procedures in effect on January 1, 1986, including those relating to environmental consultation), such project is not located on either of the following:

            (A) Any segment of a natural watercourse which is included in (or designated for potential inclusion in) a State or national wild and scenic river system.

            (B) Any segment of a natural watercourse which the State has determined, in accordance with applicable State law, to possess unique natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes which would be adversely affected by hydroelectric development.

        (3) __Fish and wildlife terms and conditions__ 

            The project meets the terms and conditions set by fish and wildlife agencies under the same procedures as provided for under section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 823a(c)][/us/usc/t16/s823a/c]\].

    (k) __“New dam or diversion” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “new dam or diversion” means a dam or diversion which requires, for purposes of installing any hydroelectric power project, any construction, or enlargement of any impoundment or diversion structure (other than repairs or reconstruction or the addition of flashboards or similar adjustable devices)  <sup>\[4\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 4 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period. </sup></sup> 

    (l) __Definitions__ 

        For purposes of this section, the terms “small power production facility”, “qualifying small power production facility”, “qualifying small power producer”, “primary energy source”, “cogeneration facility”, “qualifying cogeneration facility”, and “qualifying cogenerator” have the respective meanings provided for such terms under section 3(17) and (18) of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 796(17)][/us/usc/t16/s796/17], (18)\].

    (m) __Termination of mandatory purchase and sale requirements__ 

        (1) __Obligation to purchase__ 

        After August 8, 2005, no electric utility shall be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electric energy from a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility under this section if the Commission finds that the qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility has nondiscriminatory access to—

            (A)

                (i) independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale markets for the sale of electric energy; and (ii) wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; or

            (B)

                (i) transmission and interconnection services that are provided by a Commission-approved regional transmission entity and administered pursuant to an open access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers; and (ii) competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the qualifying facility is interconnected. In determining whether a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of transactions within the relevant market; or

            (C) wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2) __Revised purchase and sale obligation for new facilities__ 

            (A) After August 8, 2005, no electric utility shall be required pursuant to this section to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase from or sell electric energy to a facility that is not an existing qualifying cogeneration facility unless the facility meets the criteria for qualifying cogeneration facilities established by the Commission pursuant to the rulemaking required by subsection (n).

            (B)

             For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “existing qualifying cogeneration facility” means a facility that—

                (i) was a qualifying cogeneration facility on August 8, 2005; or

                (ii) had filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification, self recertification or an application for Commission certification under 18 CFR 292.207 prior to the date on which the Commission issues the final rule required by subsection (n).

        (3) __Commission review__ 

            Any electric utility may file an application with the Commission for relief from the mandatory purchase obligation pursuant to this subsection on a service territory-wide basis. Such application shall set forth the factual basis upon which relief is requested and describe why the conditions set forth in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection have been met. After notice, including sufficient notice to potentially affected qualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power production facilities, and an opportunity for comment, the Commission shall make a final determination within 90 days of such application regarding whether the conditions set forth in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) have been met.

        (4) __Reinstatement of obligation to purchase__ 

            At any time after the Commission makes a finding under paragraph (3) relieving an electric utility of its obligation to purchase electric energy, a qualifying cogeneration facility, a qualifying small power production facility, a State agency, or any other affected person may apply to the Commission for an order reinstating the electric utility’s obligation to purchase electric energy under this section. Such application shall set forth the factual basis upon which the application is based and describe why the conditions set forth in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection are no longer met. After notice, including sufficient notice to potentially affected utilities, and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall issue an order within 90 days of such application reinstating the electric utility’s obligation to purchase electric energy under this section if the Commission finds that the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) which relieved the obligation to purchase, are no longer met.

        (5) __Obligation to sell__ 

        After August 8, 2005, no electric utility shall be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to sell electric energy to a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility under this section if the Commission finds that—

            (A) competing retail electric suppliers are willing and able to sell and deliver electric energy to the qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility; and

            (B) the electric utility is not required by State law to sell electric energy in its service territory.

        (6) __No effect on existing rights and remedies__ 

            Nothing in this subsection affects the rights or remedies of any party under any contract or obligation, in effect or pending approval before the appropriate State regulatory authority or non-regulated electric utility on August 8, 2005, to purchase electric energy or capacity from or to sell electric energy or capacity to a qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility under this Act (including the right to recover costs of purchasing electric energy or capacity).

        (7) __Recovery of costs__ 

            (A) The Commission shall issue and enforce such regulations as are necessary to ensure that an electric utility that purchases electric energy or capacity from a qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility in accordance with any legally enforceable obligation entered into or imposed under this section recovers all prudently incurred costs associated with the purchase.

            (B) A regulation under subparagraph (A) shall be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of law applicable to enforcement of regulations under the Federal Power Act ([16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.).

    (n) __Rulemaking for new qualifying facilities__ 

        (1)

            (A)

             Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Commission shall issue a rule revising the criteria in 18 CFR 292.205 for new qualifying cogeneration facilities seeking to sell electric energy pursuant to this section to ensure—

                (i) that the thermal energy output of a new qualifying cogeneration facility is used in a productive and beneficial manner;

                (ii) the electrical, thermal, and chemical output of the cogeneration facility is used fundamentally for industrial, commercial, or institutional purposes and is not intended fundamentally for sale to an electric utility, taking into account technological, efficiency, economic, and variable thermal energy requirements, as well as State laws applicable to sales of electric energy from a qualifying facility to its host facility; and

                (iii) continuing progress in the development of efficient electric energy generating technology.

            (B) The rule issued pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall be applicable only to facilities that seek to sell electric energy pursuant to this section. For all other purposes, except as specifically provided in subsection (m)(2)(A), qualifying facility status shall be determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of this Act.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding rule revisions under paragraph (1), the Commission’s criteria for qualifying cogeneration facilities in effect prior to the date on which the Commission issues the final rule required by paragraph (1) shall continue to apply to any cogeneration facility that—

            (A) was a qualifying cogeneration facility on August 8, 2005, or

            (B) had filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification, self-recertification or an application for Commission certification under 18 CFR 292.207 prior to the date on which the Commission issues the final rule required by paragraph (1).

If the Commission initially finds that the project will have substantial adverse effects on the environment within the meaning of such paragraph (1), prior to making a final finding under that paragraph the Commission shall afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity to provide for mitigation of such adverse effects. The Commission shall make a final finding under such paragraph (1) at the time the license or exemption is issued. If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has notified the State of its initial finding and the State has not taken any action described in paragraph (2) of section 210(j) before such final finding, the failure to take such action shall be the basis for a rebuttable presumption that there is not a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes for purposes of such finding.

>         “(D) If a petition under subparagraph (A) is denied, all provisions of section 210(j) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \[[16 U.S.C. 824a–3(j)][/us/usc/t16/s824a–3/j]\] shall apply to the project regardless of when the license or exemption is issued.”

[Pub. L. 102–486, title XIII, § 1335][/us/pl/102/486/s1335], Oct. 24, 1992, [106 Stat. 2984][/us/stat/106/2984], provided that: 

> “Nothing in section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ([Public Law 95–617][/us/pl/95/617]) \[[16 U.S.C. 824a–3][/us/usc/t16/s824a–3]\] requires a State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility to treat a cost reasonably identified to be incurred or to have been incurred in the construction or operation of a facility or a project which has been selected by the Department of Energy and provided Federal funding pursuant to the Clean Coal Program authorized by [Public Law 98–473][/us/pl/98/473] \[see Tables for classification\] as an incremental cost of alternative electric energy.”

 __Applicability of 1980 Amendment to Facilities Using Solar Energy as Primary Energy Source__ 

[Pub. L. 100–202, § 101(d)][/us/pl/100/202/s101/d] \[title III, § 310\], Dec. 22, 1987, [101 Stat. 1329–104][/us/stat/101/1329-104], 1329–126, provided that:

>     “(a) The amendments made by section 643(b) of the Energy Security Act ([Public Law 96–294][/us/pl/96/294]) \[amending this section\] and any regulations issued to implement such amendment shall apply to qualifying small power production facilities (as such term is defined in the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 791a][/us/usc/t16/s791a] et seq.\]) using solar energy as the primary energy source to the same extent such amendments and regulations apply to qualifying small power production facilities using geothermal energy as the primary energy source, except that nothing in this Act \[see Tables for classification\] shall preclude the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from revising its regulations to limit the availability of exemptions authorized under this Act as it determines to be required in the public interest and consistent with its obligations and duties under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \[this section\].

>     “(b)

>      The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to a facility using solar energy as the primary energy source only if either of the following is submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during the two-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act \[Dec. 22, 1987\]:

>         “(1) An application for certification of the facility as a qualifying small power production facility.

>         “(2) Notice that the facility meets the requirements for qualification.”

>     “(1) The Commission shall conduct a study (in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \[[42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)][/us/usc/t42/s4332/2/C]\]) of whether the benefits of section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \[[16 U.S.C. 824a–3][/us/usc/t16/s824a–3]\] and section 210 of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 824i][/us/usc/t16/s824i]\] should be applied to hydroelectric power facilities utilizing new dams or diversions (within the meaning of section 210(k) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978).

>     “(2) The study under this subsection shall take into consideration the need for such new dams or diversions for power purposes, the environmental impacts of such new dams and diversions (both with and without the application of the amendments made by this Act to sections 4, 10, and 30 of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 797][/us/usc/t16/s797], 803, 823a\] and section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 \[[16 U.S.C. 824a–3][/us/usc/t16/s824a–3]\]), the environmental effects of such facilities alone and in combination with other existing or proposed dams or diversions on the same waterway, the intent of Congress to encourage and give priority to the application of section 210 of Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to existing dams and diversions rather than such new dams or diversions, and the impact of such section 210 on the rates paid by electric power consumers.

>     “(3) The study under this subsection shall be initiated within 3 months after enactment of this Act \[Oct. 16, 1986\] and completed as promptly as practicable.

>     “(4) A report containing the results of the study conducted under this subsection shall be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate while both Houses are in session.

>     “(5) The report submitted under paragraph (4) shall include a determination (and the basis thereof) by the Commission, based on the study and a public hearing and subject to review under section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act \[[16 U.S.C. 825][/us/usc/t16/s825]l(b)\], whether any of the benefits referred to in paragraph (1) should be available for such facilities and whether applications for preliminary permits (or licenses where no preliminary permit has been issued) for such small power production facilities utilizing new dams or diversions should be accepted by the Commission after the moratorium period specified in subsection (e). The report shall include such other administrative and legislative recommendations as the Commission deems appropriate.

>     “(6) If the study under this subsection has not been completed within 18 months after its initiation, the Commission shall notify the Committees referred to in paragraph (4) of the reasons for the delay and specify a date when it will be completed and a report submitted.”
