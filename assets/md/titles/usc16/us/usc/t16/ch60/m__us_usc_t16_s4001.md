## § 4001. Congressional findings

    The Congress finds that—

    (1) the commercial fishing industry of the United States significantly contributes to the national economy, and could make a greater contribution if fish resources within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone were more fully utilized;

    (2) the commercial fisheries of the United States provide significant employment in coastal areas and in processing and distribution centers;

    (3) fish contribute an important nutritional component to the American diet;

    (4) increased consumption of seafood in the United States could significantly lower the risk of many cardiovascular diseases;

    (5) Federally supported development programs for commercial fisheries are unable to meet present and future marketing needs;

    (6) many fish species are underutilized by the United States fishing industry because of underdeveloped markets; and

    (7) the United States fishing industry has the potential to expand greatly its contribution to interstate and foreign commerce, favorably affecting the balance of trade.
