    (b) __Oaths and affirmations__ 

        For the purpose of investigations under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. The attendance of such witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States.

    (c) __Court orders__
