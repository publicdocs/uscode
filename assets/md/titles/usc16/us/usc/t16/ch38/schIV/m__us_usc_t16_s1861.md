            (A)

             with or without a warrant or other process—

                (i) arrest any person, if he has reasonable cause to believe that such person has committed an act prohibited by [section 1857 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1857];

                (ii) board, and search or inspect, any fishing vessel which is subject to the provisions of this chapter;

The arrest authority described in the preceding sentence may be conferred upon an officer or employee of a State agency, subject to such conditions and restrictions as are set forth by agreement between the State agency, the Secretary, and, with respect to enforcement operations within the exclusive economic zone, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating.

            (F) reimbursement to any Federal or State agency, including the Coast Guard, for services performed, or personnel, equipment, or facilities utilized, under any agreement with the Secretary entered into pursuant to subsection (a), or any similar agreement authorized by law.
