            (B) developing alternative fishing opportunities for participants in the New England groundfish fishery;

            (C) providing technical support and assistance to United States fishermen and fish processors to improve the value-added processing of underutilized species and to make participation in fisheries for underutilized species of the northwest Atlantic Ocean economically viable;

            (D) creating new economic opportunities through the improved processing and expanded use of fish waste; and

            (E) helping to restore overfished New England groundfish stocks through aquaculture or hatchery programs.

        (2)  __Consultation__  __.—__
