## § 1826j. Illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing

    (a) __Identification__ 

        (1) __Identification for actions of fishing vessels__ 

        The Secretary shall, based on a cumulative compilation and analysis of data collected and provided by international fishery management organizations and other nations and organizations, identify, and list in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h], a nation if fishing vessels of that nation are engaged, or have been engaged at any point during the preceding 3 years, in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing—

            (A) that undermines the effectiveness of measures required by an international fishery management organization, taking into account whether the relevant international fishery management organization has failed to implement effective measures to end the illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activity by that nation or the nation is not a party to, or does not maintain cooperating status with, such organization; or

            (B) where no international fishery management organization exists with a mandate to regulate the fishing activity in question.

        (2) __Identification for actions of nation__ 

        Taking into account the factors described under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall also identify, and list in such report, a nation—

            (A) if it is violating, or has violated at any point during the preceding 3 years, conservation and management measures required under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party and the violations undermine the effectiveness of such measures; or

            (B) if it is failing, or has failed in the preceding 3-year period, to effectively address or regulate illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing in areas described under paragraph (1)(B).

        (3) __Application to other entities__ 

            Where the provisions of this Act are applicable to nations, they shall also be applicable, as appropriate, to other entities that have competency to enter into international fishery management agreements.

    (b) __Notification__ 

        The Secretary shall notify the President and that nation of such an identification.

    (c) __Consultation__ 

    No later than 60 days after submitting a report to Congress under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h], the Secretary, acting through the Secretary of State, shall—

        (1) notify nations listed in the report of the requirements of this section;

        (2) initiate consultations for the purpose of encouraging such nations to take the appropriate corrective action with respect to the offending activities of their fishing vessels identified in the report; and

        (3) notify any relevant international fishery management organization of the actions taken by the United States under this section.

    (d) __IUU certification procedure__ 

        (1) __Certification__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a procedure, consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, for determining if a nation identified under subsection (a) and listed in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h] has taken appropriate corrective action with respect to the offending activities identified in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h]. The certification procedure shall provide for notice and an opportunity for comment by any such nation. The Secretary shall determine, on the basis of the procedure, and certify to the Congress no later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary promulgates a final rule containing the procedure, and biennially thereafter in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h]—

            (A) whether the government of each nation identified under subsection (a) has provided documentary evidence that it has taken corrective action with respect to the offending activities identified in the report; or

            (B) whether the relevant international fishery management organization has implemented measures that are effective in ending the illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activity by vessels of that nation.

        (2) __Alternative procedure__ 

        The Secretary may establish a procedure to authorize, on a shipment-by-shipment, shipper-by-shipper, or other basis the importation of fish or fish products from a vessel of a nation issued a negative certification under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that—

            (A) the vessel has not engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party; or

            (B) the vessel is not identified by an international fishery management organization as participating in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activities.

        (3) __Effect of certification__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The provisions of section 1826a(a) and section 1826a(b)(3) and (4) of this title—

                (i) shall apply to any nation identified under subsection (a) for which the Secretary has issued a negative certification under this subsection; but

                (ii) shall not apply to any nation identified under subsection (a) for which the Secretary has issued a positive certification under this subsection.

            (B) __Exceptions__ 

            Subparagraph (A)(i) does not apply—

                (i) to the extent that such provisions would apply to sport fishing equipment or to fish or fish products not managed under the applicable international fishery agreement; or

                (ii) if there is no applicable international fishery agreement, to the extent that such provisions would apply to fish or fish products caught by vessels not engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing.

        (3) __Guidelines__ 

        The Secretary shall include in the definition, at a minimum—

            (B) overfishing of fish stocks shared by the United States, for which there are no applicable international conservation or management measures or in areas with no applicable international fishery management organization or agreement, that has adverse impacts on such stocks; and

            (C) fishing activity that has an adverse impact on seamounts, hydrothermal vents, and cold water corals located beyond national jurisdiction, for which there are no applicable conservation or management measures or in areas with no applicable international fishery management organization or agreement.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 1826a(a) and section 1826a(b)(3) and (4) of this title, referred to in subsec. (d)(3)(A), was in the original “section 101(a) and section 101(b)(3) and (4) of this Act ([16 U.S.C. 1826a(a)][/us/usc/t16/s1826a/a], (b)(3), and (b)(4))” and was translated as meaning section 101(a) and section 101(b)(3) and (4) of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    This Act, referred to in subsecs. (a)(3) and (e)(1), (2), probably means title VI of [Pub.
