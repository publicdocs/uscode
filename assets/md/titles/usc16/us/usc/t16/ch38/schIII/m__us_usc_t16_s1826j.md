    (a) __Identification__ 

    The Secretary shall identify, and list in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h], a nation if fishing vessels of that nation are engaged, or have been engaged at any point during the preceding 2 years, in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing—

        (2) where no international fishery management organization exists with a mandate to regulate the fishing activity in question.

    (b) __Notification__ 

        An identification under subsection (a) or [section 1826k(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826k/a] is deemed to be an identification under [section 1826a(b)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826a/b/1/A], and the Secretary shall notify the President and that nation of such identification.

    (c) __Consultation__

        (3) notify any relevant international fishery management organization of the actions taken by the United States under this section.

    (d) __IUU certification procedure__ 

        (1) __Certification__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a procedure, consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, for determining if a nation identified under subsection (a) and listed in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h] has taken appropriate corrective action with respect to the offending activities of its fishing vessels identified in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h]. The certification procedure shall provide for notice and an opportunity for comment by any such nation. The Secretary shall determine, on the basis of the procedure, and certify to the Congress no later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary promulgates a final rule containing the procedure, and biennially thereafter in the report under [section 1826h of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1826h]—

            (A) whether the government of each nation identified under subsection (a) has provided documentary evidence that it has taken corrective action with respect to the offending activities of its fishing vessels identified in the report; or

            (B) whether the relevant international fishery management organization has implemented measures that are effective in ending the illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activity by vessels of that nation.

        (2) __Alternative procedure__ 

        The Secretary may establish a procedure for certification, on a shipment-by-shipment, shipper-by-shipper, or other basis of fish or fish products from a vessel of a harvesting nation not certified under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that—

            (A) the vessel has not engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party; or

                (i) shall apply to any nation identified under subsection (a) that has not been certified by the Secretary under this subsection, or for which the Secretary has issued a negative certification under this subsection; but

                (ii) shall not apply to any nation identified under subsection (a) for which the Secretary has issued a positive certification under this subsection.

            (B) __Exceptions__
