## § 778. Establishment of experiment stations; purpose of research

    The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish 1 or more centers for the purpose of carrying on a program of research and experimentation—

    (2) to determine methods for production of fingerling fishes for stocking in commercial reservoirs;

    (3) to develop methods for the control of parasites and diseases of brood fishes and of fingerlings prior to stocking;

    (4) to develop economical methods for raising the more desirable species of fishes to a marketable size;

    (5) to determine, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, the effects of fish-rice rotations, including crops other than rice commonly grown on rice farms, upon both the fish and other crops; and

    (6) to develop suitable methods for harvesting the fish crop and preparing it for marketing, including a study of sport fishing as a means of such harvest.
