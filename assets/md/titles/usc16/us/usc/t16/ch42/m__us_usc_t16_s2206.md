    In this section:

        (1) __Emergency measures__ 

        The term “emergency measures” means those measures that—

            (A)

             are necessary to address damage caused by a natural disaster to natural resources on nonindustrial private forest land, and the damage, if not treated—

                (i) would impair or endanger the natural resources on the land; and

                (ii) would materially affect future use of the land; and

            (B) would restore forest health and forest-related resources on the land.

        (2) __Natural disaster__ 

            The term “natural disaster” includes wildfires, hurricanes or excessive winds, drought, ice storms or blizzards, floods, or other resource-impacting events, as determined by the Secretary.

        (3) __Nonindustrial private forest land__ 

        The term “nonindustrial private forest land” means rural land, as determined by the Secretary, that—

            (A) has existing tree cover (or had tree cover immediately before the natural disaster and is suitable for growing trees); and

            (B) is owned by any nonindustrial private individual, group, association, corporation, or other private legal entity, that has definitive decision-making authority over the land.

        (4) __Secretary__ 

            The term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Agriculture.

    (b) __Availability of assistance__ 

        The Secretary may make payments to an owner of nonindustrial private forest land who carries out emergency measures to restore the land after the land is damaged by a natural disaster.

    (c) __Eligibility__ 

        To be eligible to receive a payment under subsection (b), an owner must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the nonindustrial private forest land on which the emergency measures are carried out had tree cover immediately before the natural disaster.

    (d) __Cost share requirement__ 

        Payments made under subsection (b) shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost of the emergency measures carried out by an owner of nonindustrial private forest land.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such funds as may be necessary to carry out this section. Amounts so appropriated shall remain available until expended.
