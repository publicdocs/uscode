## § 7301. Purpose

    The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes through a process that—

    (1) encourages ecological, economic, and social sustainability;

    (2) leverages local resources with national and private resources;

    (3) facilitates the reduction of wildfire management costs, including through reestablishing natural fire regimes and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire; and

    (4)

     demonstrates the degree to which—

        (A)

         various ecological restoration techniques—

            (i) achieve ecological and watershed health objectives; and

            (ii) affect wildfire activity and management costs; and

        (B) the use of forest restoration byproducts can offset treatment costs while benefitting local rural economies and improving forest health.
