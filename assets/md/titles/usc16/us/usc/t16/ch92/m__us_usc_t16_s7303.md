## § 7303. Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall establish a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program to select and fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes in accordance with—

        (1) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ([16 U.S.C. 1531][/us/usc/t16/s1531] et seq.);

        (2) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.); and

        (3) any other applicable law.

    (b) __Eligibility criteria__ 

    To be eligible for nomination under subsection (c), a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal shall—

        (1)

         be based on a landscape restoration strategy that—

            (A) is complete or substantially complete;

            (B)

             identifies and prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period within a landscape that is—

                (i) at least 50,000 acres;

                (ii) comprised primarily of forested National Forest System land, but may also include land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or other Federal, State, tribal, or private land;

                (iii) in need of active ecosystem restoration; and

                (iv) accessible by existing or proposed wood-processing infrastructure at an appropriate scale to use woody biomass and small-diameter wood removed in ecological restoration treatments;

            (C) incorporates the best available science and scientific application tools in ecological restoration strategies;

            (D) fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands according to the pre-fire suppression old growth conditions characteristic of the forest type, taking into account the contribution of the stand to landscape fire adaptation and watershed health and retaining the large trees contributing to old growth structure;

            (E)

             would carry out any forest restoration treatments that reduce hazardous fuels by—

                (i) focusing on small diameter trees, thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and fire use to modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected reduction of uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil impacts, tree mortality or other impacts); and

                (ii) maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire-resilient stands; and

            (F)

                (i) does not include the establishment of permanent roads; and

                (ii) would commit funding to decommission all temporary roads constructed to carry out the strategy;

        (2)

         be developed and implemented through a collaborative process that—

            (A) includes multiple interested persons representing diverse interests; and

            (B)

                (i) is transparent and nonexclusive; or

                (ii) meets the requirements for a resource advisory committee under subsections (c) through (f) of [section 7125 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7125];  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (3)

         describe plans to—

            (A) reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire, including through the use of fire for ecological restoration and maintenance and reestablishing natural fire regimes, where appropriate;

            (F) use woody biomass and small-diameter trees produced from projects implementing the strategy;

            (G) report annually on performance, including through performance measures from the plan entitled the “10 Year Comprehensive Strategy Implementation Plan” and dated December 2006; and

            (H) take into account any applicable community wildfire protection plan;

        (4)

         analyze any anticipated cost savings, including those resulting from—

            (A) reduced wildfire management costs; and

            (B) a decrease in the unit costs of implementing ecological restoration treatments over time;

        (5)

         estimate—

            (A) the annual Federal funding necessary to implement the proposal; and

            (B) Youth Conservation Corps crews or related partnerships, with State, local, and non-profit youth groups;

            (C) existing or proposed small or micro-businesses, clusters, or incubators; or

            (D) other entities that will hire or train local people to complete such contracts, grants, or agreements; and
