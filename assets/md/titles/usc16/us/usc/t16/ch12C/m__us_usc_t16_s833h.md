 __Codification__ 

    Provisions which authorized the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Army, and the Secretary of Energy to appoint such attorneys, engineers, and other experts as may be necessary for carrying out the functions entrusted to them under this chapter “without regard to the provisions of the civil-service laws”, and to fix their compensation “at not to exceed $7,500 per annum”, have been omitted as obsolete and superseded.

    Such appointments are subject to the civil service laws unless specifically excepted by those laws or by laws enacted subsequent to Executive Order No. 8743, Apr. 23, 1941, issued by the President pursuant to the [Act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I][/us/act/1940-11-26/ch919/tI], § 1, [54 Stat. 1211][/us/stat/54/1211], which covered most excepted positions into the classified (competitive) civil service.

[Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

Section 1 of act Aug. 10, 1956, enacted “Title 10, Armed Forces” which in sections 3010 to 3013 continued military Department of the Army under administrative supervision of Secretary of the Army.

    “Secretary of Energy” substituted in text for “Federal Power Commission” pursuant to [Pub. L. 95–91][/us/pl/95/91], § 301(b), which is classified to [section 7151(b) of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s7151/b].
