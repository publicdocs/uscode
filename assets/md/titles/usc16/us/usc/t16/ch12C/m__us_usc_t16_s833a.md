The Bureau shall exercise the powers and perform the duties provided for in this chapter under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with [section 373a of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s373a]. The Bureau shall, as hereinafter provided, make all arrangements for the sale and disposition of electric energy generated at the Fort Peck project not required for the operation of the dam at such project and the navigation facilities employed in connection therewith. The form of administration herein established for the Fort Peck project is intended to be provisional pending the establishment of a permanent administration for Fort Peck and other projects in the Missouri River Basin. The Secretary of the Army shall install and maintain additional machinery, equipment, and facilities for the generation of electric energy at the Fort Peck project when in the judgment of the Bureau such additional generating facilities are desirable to meet actual or potential market requirements for such electric energy. The Secretary of the Army shall schedule the operations of the several electrical generating units and appurtenant equipment of the Fort Peck project in accordance with the requirements of the Bureau. The Secretary of the Army shall provide and maintain for the use of the Bureau at said Fort Peck project adequate station space and equipment, including such switches, switchboards, instruments, and dispatching facilities as may be required by the Bureau for proper reception, handling, and dispatching of the electric energy produced at the said project, together with transformers and other equipment required by the Bureau for the transmission of such energy from that place at suitable voltage to the markets which the Bureau desires to serve.

    (b) __Construction and maintenance of electric transmission lines, substations, and interconnections__ 

        In order to encourage the widest possible use of all electric energy that can be generated and marketed and to provide reasonable outlets therefor, and to prevent the monopolization thereof by limited groups, the Bureau is authorized and directed to provide, construct, operate, maintain, and improve such electric transmission lines and substations, and facilities and structures appurtenant thereto, as it finds necessary, desirable, or appropriate for the purpose of transmitting electric energy, available for sale, from the Fort Peck project to existing and potential markets, and, for the purpose of interchange of electric energy, to interconnect the Fort Peck project with either private or with other Federal projects and publicly owned power systems now or hereafter constructed.

    (c) __Acquisition of real and personal property__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in the name of the United States, to acquire, by purchase, lease, condemnation, or donation, such real and personal property, or any interest therein, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, franchises, electric transmission lines, substations, and facilities and structures appurtenant thereto, as he finds necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Title to all property and property rights acquired by said Secretary shall be taken in the name of the United States.

    (d) __Acquisition of any property or property rights__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior shall have power to acquire any property or property rights, including patent rights, which in his opinion are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, by purchase, lease, donation, or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain and to institute condemnation proceedings therefor in the same manner as is provided by law for the condemnation of real estate.

    (e) __Disposal of real and personal property__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in the name of the United States, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of such personal property as in his judgment is not required for the purposes of this chapter and such real property and interests in land acquired in connection with construction or operation of electric transmission lines or substations as in his judgment are not required for the purposes of this chapter.

    (f) __Contracts by Bureau__ 

        Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Bureau is authorized, in the name of the United States, to negotiate and enter into such contracts, agreements, and arrangements as it shall find necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
