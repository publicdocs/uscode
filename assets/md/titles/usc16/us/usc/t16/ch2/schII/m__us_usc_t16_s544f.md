    (l) __Commission ordinances__ 

        (1) Within ninety days after making a determination that a county has failed to comply with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section, the Commission shall make and publish an ordinance setting standards for the use of non-Federal lands of such county within the boundaries of the special management areas.

        (2) The Commission shall promptly submit the ordinance to the Secretary. The Secretary shall, within ninety days after receipt of the ordinance from the Commission, concur with the tentative determination that the land use ordinance is consistent with the management plan unless a determination of inconsistency is made. Any ordinance submitted to the Secretary shall become effective upon concurrence. Should the Secretary fail to concur within ninety days, the land use ordinance shall be effective.

    (m) __Subsequent compliance__ 

        In the event the Commission has adopted an ordinance pursuant to this section, the affected county may thereafter, upon written notice to the Commission and to the Secretary, elect to adopt a special management area land use ordinance, in which event it shall comply with the provisions of this section for adoption of special management area land use ordinances. Upon concurrence of such land use ordinances by the Secretary they shall supersede any special management area land use ordinances for the county development by the Commission, subject to valid existing rights.

    (n) __Effect of Secretary’s non-concurrence__ 

        If the Secretary does not concur in any land use ordinance approved or adopted by the Commission pursuant to this section, the availability of certain funds to the relevant county shall be governed by [section 544n(c) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s544n/c].
