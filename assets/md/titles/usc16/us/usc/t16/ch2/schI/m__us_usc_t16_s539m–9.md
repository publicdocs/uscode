## § 539m–9. Construction

    (a) __Strict construction__ 

        Sections 539m to 539m–12 of this title recognize only enumerated rights and interests, and no additional rights, interests, obligations, or duties shall be created by implication.

    (b) __Existing rights__ 

        To the extent there exist within the Area as of February 20, 2003, any valid private property rights associated with private land that are not otherwise addressed in sections 539m to 539m–12 of this title, such rights are not modified or otherwise affected by sections 539m to 539m–12 of this title, nor is the exercise of any such right subject to the Pueblo’s right to withhold consent to new uses in the Area as set forth in [section 539m–3(a)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s539m–3/a/3/A].

    (c) __Not precedent__ 

        The provisions of sections 539m to 539m–12 of this title creating certain rights and interests in the National Forest System are uniquely suited to resolve the Pueblo’s claim and the geographic and societal situation involved, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other situation involving management of the National Forest System.

    (d) __Fish and wildlife__ 

        Except as provided in [section 539m–6(b)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s539m–6/b/2/B], nothing in sections 539m to 539m–12 of this title shall be construed as affecting the responsibilities of the State of New Mexico with respect to fish and wildlife, including the regulation of hunting, fishing, or trapping within the Area.
