Such certification shall be submitted on an annual basis to the House of Representatives and the Senate pursuant to the schedule required under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

        (5) Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to change the existing relationship of other Federal laws to the law of a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or to relieve any person or any obligation imposed by any law of any State, or political subdivision of a State. No provision of this subsection shall be construed to invalidate any provision of State or local law unless there is a direct conflict between such provision and the law of the State, or political subdivision of the State, so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. This subsection shall in no way be interpreted to interfere with a State’s right to protect, rehabilitate, preserve, and restore lands within its established boundary.
