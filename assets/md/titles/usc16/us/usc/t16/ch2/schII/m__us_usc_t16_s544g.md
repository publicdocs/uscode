## § 544g. Land acquisition

    (a) __Acquisition authorized__ 

        (1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire any lands or interests therein within the special management areas and the Dodson/Warrendale Special Purchase Unit which the Secretary determines are needed to achieve the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title: Provided, That any lands, waters, or interests therein owned by either State or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange.

        (2) Lands within the State of Oregon acquired by the Secretary pursuant to sections 544 to 544p of this title shall become part of the Mount Hood National Forest. Lands within the State of Washington acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall become part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. All lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to sections 544 to 544p of this title shall be subject to the laws and regulations pertaining to the National Forest System and sections 544 to 544p of this title.

    (b) __Limitations on eminent domain__ 

        (1)

         Where authorized in subsection (a) of this section to acquire land or interests therein without the consent of the owner, the Secretary shall—

            (A) acquire only such land or interests therein as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title; and

            (B) do so only in cases where all reasonable efforts to acquire with the consent of the owner such lands, or interests therein, have failed.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may not acquire without the consent of the owner lands or interests therein which—

            (A) on November 17, 1986, were used primarily for educational, religious, or charitable purposes, single-family residential purposes, farming, or grazing so long as the existing character of that use is not substantially changed or permitted for change;

            (B) are located in counties with land use ordinances in which the Secretary has concurred pursuant to [section 544f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s544f], unless such lands are being used, or are in imminent danger of being used, in a manner incompatible with such ordinances;

            (C) are within the boundaries of the Dodson/Warrendale Special Purchase Unit; or

            (D) are owned by an Indian tribe, held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe, or otherwise administered by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe.

    (c) __Hardship cases__ 

        In exercising authority to acquire lands pursuant to this section the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by any person or entity owning any land, or interest in land, within the boundaries of a special management area. In considering such offer, the Secretary shall take into consideration any hardship to the owner which might result from any undue delay in acquiring the property.

    (d) __Land exchanges__ 

        (1) The Secretary is authorized and directed, in conformance with the provisions of this subsection, to acquire by exchange any parcel of unimproved forest land at least forty acres in size within the boundaries of the special management areas which is owned by any private forest land owner if, after November 17, 1986, but within one hundred and eighty days after final adoption of the management plan, such private forest land owner offers to the United States such parcel of forest land.

        (2) In exercising this authority to acquire forest lands pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may accept title to such lands and convey to the owner federally owned lands deemed appropriate by the Secretary within the States of Oregon and Washington, regardless of the State in which the transferred lands are located. Forest lands exchanged pursuant to this subsection shall be of approximately equal value: Provided, That the Secretary may accept cash from or pay cash to the grantor in such an exchange in order to equalize minor differences in the values of the properties exchanged: Provided further, That the Secretary may reserve in any conveyance pursuant to this subsection such easements, subsurface rights, and any other interests in land deemed necessary or desirable: Provided further, That the valuation of lands exchanged shall be determined in terms of forest uses for timber.

        (3) It is the intention of Congress that land exchanges pursuant to this subsection shall be completed no later than five years after November 17, 1986.

        (4) In the event that exchanges authorized by this section leave any private forest land owner with ownership of an uneconomic remnant of forest land contiguous to a special management area, the Secretary is authorized to acquire such forest lands as if they were within the boundaries of a special management area.

        (5) The following-described Federal lands and interests therein are hereby identified as candidate lands for exchanges conducted pursuant to this section: Provided, That the determination of which candidate lands will be exchanged, and in what sequence, shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Subject to valid existing rights, such lands are hereby withdrawn from all forms of entry or appropriation or disposal under the public land laws, and from location, entry, and patent under the United States mining law, and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and all amendments thereto until the Secretary determines such lands are no longer needed to complete exchanges authorized by this section: Provided, That such period shall not extend beyond five years:
