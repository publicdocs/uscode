## § 471c. Lands in California set aside as reserved forest lands

    The tracts of land in the State of California known and described as follows: Commencing at the northwest corner of township 2 north, range 19 east Mount Diablo meridian, thence eastwardly on the line between townships 2 and 3 north, ranges 24 and 25 east; thence southwardly on the line between ranges 24 and 25 east to the Mount Diablo base line; thence eastwardly on said base line to the corner to township 1 south, ranges 25 and 26 east; thence southwardly on the line between ranges 25 and 26 east to the southeast corner of township 2 south, range 25 east; thence eastwardly on the line between townships 2 and 3 south, range 26 east to the corner to townships 2 and 3 south, ranges 26 and 27 east; thence southwardly on the line between ranges 26 and 27 east to the first standard parallel south; thence westwardly on the first standard parallel south to the southwest corner of township 4 south, range 19 east; thence northwardly on the line between ranges 18 and 19 east to the northwest corner of township 2 south, range 19 east; thence westwardly on the line between townships 1 and 2 south to the southwest corner of township 1 south, range 19 east; thence northwardly on the line between ranges 18 and 19 east to the northwest corner of township 2 north, range 19 east, the place of beginning, are reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and set apart as reserved forest lands; and all persons who shall locate or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed therefrom. Nothing in this section and sections 55, 61, and 471d of this title shall be construed as in anywise affecting any bona fide entry of land made within the limits above described under any law of the United States prior to October 1, 1890.

([Oct. 1, 1890, ch. 1263, § 1][/us/act/1890-10-01/ch1263/s1], [26 Stat. 650][/us/stat/26/650].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly set out as [section 44 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s44]. As originally enacted, this section contained two further provisions that “nothing in this act shall be construed as in any wise affecting the grant of lands made to the State of California by virtue of the act entitled ‘An act authorizing a grant to the State of California of the Yosemite Valley, and of the land’ embracing the Mariposa Big-Tree Grove, approved June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four; or as affecting any bona-fide entry of land made within the limits above described under any law of the United States prior to the approval of this act.” The first quoted provision was omitted from the Code because the land, granted to the state of California pursuant to the Act cited, was receded to the United States. Resolution June 11, 1906, No. 27, accepted the recession.
