## § 539k. Kelly Butte Special Management Area

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        Upon conveyance to the United States of the Plum Creek offered lands in the Kelly Butte area, there is hereby established the Kelly Butte Special Management Area in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, comprising approximately 5,642 acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled “Kelly Butte Special Management Area”, dated October 1998.

    (b) __Management__ 

    The Kelly Butte Special Management Area shall be managed by the Secretary in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to National Forest System lands, and subject to the following additional provisions:

        (1)

         the Area shall be managed with special emphasis on:

            (A) preserving its natural character and protecting and enhancing water quality in the upper Green River watershed;

            (B) permitting hunting and fishing;

            (C) providing opportunities for primitive and semi-primitive recreation and scientific research and study;

            (D) protecting and enhancing populations of fish, wildlife and native plant species; and

            (E) allowing for traditional uses by native American peoples;

        (2) commercial timber harvest and road construction shall be prohibited;

        (3) the Area shall be closed to the use of motor vehicles, except as may be necessary for administrative purposes or in emergencies (including rescue operations) to protect public health and safety; and

        (4) the Area shall, subject to valid existing rights, be permanently withdrawn from all forms of entry and appropriation under the U.S. mining laws and mineral leasing laws, including the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 \[[30 U.S.C. 1001][/us/usc/t30/s1001] et seq.\].

    (c) __No buffer zones__ 

        Congress does not intend that the designation of the Kelly Butte Special Management Area lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the Area. The fact that non-compatible activities or uses can be seen or heard from within the Kelly Butte Special Management Area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the Area.

> “SEC. 602. __FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.__ 

>     “(a)  __Findings__  __.—__ 

>     Congress finds that—

>         “(1) certain parcels of private land located in central and southwest Washington are intermingled with National Forest System land owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as parts of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;

>         “(2) the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of square mile sections;

>         “(3) the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound and efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;

>         “(4)

>          acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including—

>             “(A)

>              enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including—

>                 “(i) the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;

>                 “(ii) the Pacific Crest Trail;

>                 “(iii) Snoqualmie Pass;

>                 “(iv) Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and

>                 “(v) other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;

>             “(B) protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;

>             “(C) consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and

>             “(D)

>              a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through—

>                 “(i) consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;

>                 “(ii) elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;

>                 “(iii) reduced right-of-way, special use, and other permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on National Forest System land; and

>                 “(iv) other administrative cost savings;

>         “(5)

>          Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels—

>             “(A) are intermingled with parcels owned by Plum Creek; and

>             “(B)

>                 (i) are generally located in less environmentally sensitive areas than the Plum Creek offered land; and

>                 “(ii) have lower public recreation and other public values than the Plum Creek offered land;

>         “(6) time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and

>         “(7) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.

>     “(b)  __Purpose__  __.—__ 

>     It is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment.
