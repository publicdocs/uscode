## § 1412. International Dolphin Conservation Program

The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, shall seek to secure a binding international agreement to establish an International Dolphin Conservation Program that requires—

    (1) that the total annual dolphin mortality in the purse seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean shall not exceed 5,000 animals with a commitment and objective to progressively reduce dolphin mortality to a level approaching zero through the setting of annual limits;

    (2) the establishment of a per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit, to be in effect through calendar year 2000, at a level between 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent of the minimum population estimate, as calculated, revised, or approved by the Secretary;

    (3) the establishment of a per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit, beginning with the calendar year 2001, at a level less than or equal to 0.1 percent of the minimum population estimate as calculated, revised, or approved by the Secretary;

    (4)

     that if a dolphin mortality limit is exceeded under—

        (A) paragraph (1), all sets on dolphins shall cease for the applicable fishing year; and

        (B) paragraph (2) or (3), all sets on the stocks covered under paragraph (2) or (3) and any mixed schools that contain any of those stocks shall cease for the applicable fishing year;

    (5)

     a scientific review and assessment to be conducted in calendar year 1998 to—

        (A) assess progress in meeting the objectives set for calendar year 2000 under paragraph (2); and

        (B) as appropriate, consider recommendations for meeting these objectives;

    (6)

     a scientific review and assessment to be conducted in calendar year 2000—

        (A) to review the stocks covered under paragraph (3); and

        (B) as appropriate to consider recommendations to further the objectives set under that paragraph;

    (7) the establishment of a per vessel maximum annual dolphin mortality limit consistent with the established per-year mortality limits, as determined under paragraphs (1) through (3); and

    (8) the provision of a system of incentives to vessel captains to continue to reduce dolphin mortality, with the goal of eliminating dolphin mortality.
