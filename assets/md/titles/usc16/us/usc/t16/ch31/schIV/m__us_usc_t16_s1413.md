## § 1413. Regulatory authority of Secretary

    (a) __Regulations__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall issue regulations, and revise those regulations as may be appropriate, to implement the International Dolphin Conservation Program.

        (2)

            (A) The Secretary shall issue regulations to authorize and govern the taking of marine mammals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, including any species of marine mammal designated as depleted under this chapter but not listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act ([16 U.S.C. 1531][/us/usc/t16/s1531] et seq.), by vessels of the United States participating in the International Dolphin Conservation Program.

            (B)

             Regulations issued under this section shall include provisions—

                (i) requiring observers on each vessel;

                (ii) requiring use of the backdown procedure or other procedures equally or more effective in avoiding mortality of, or serious injury to, marine mammals in fishing operations;

                (iii) prohibiting intentional sets on stocks and schools in accordance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program;

                (iv) requiring the use of special equipment, including dolphin safety panels in nets, monitoring devices as identified by the International Dolphin Conservation Program to detect unsafe fishing conditions that may cause high incidental dolphin mortality before nets are deployed by a tuna vessel, operable rafts, speedboats with towing bridles, floodlights in operable condition, and diving masks and snorkels;

                (v) ensuring that the backdown procedure during sets of purse seine net on marine mammals is completed and rolling of the net to sack up has begun no later than 30 minutes before sundown;

                (vi) banning the use of explosive devices in all purse seine operations;

                (vii) establishing per vessel maximum annual dolphin mortality limits, total dolphin mortality limits and per-stock per-year mortality limits in accordance with the International Dolphin Conservation Program;

                (viii) preventing the making of intentional sets on dolphins after reaching either the vessel maximum annual dolphin mortality limits, total dolphin mortality limits, or per-stock per-year mortality limits;

                (ix) preventing the fishing on dolphins by a vessel without an assigned vessel dolphin mortality limit;

                (x) allowing for the authorization and conduct of experimental fishing operations, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, for the purpose of testing proposed improvements in fishing techniques and equipment that may reduce or eliminate dolphin mortality or serious injury do not require the encirclement of dolphins in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing;

                (xi) authorizing fishing within the area covered by the International Dolphin Conservation Program by vessels of the United States without the use of special equipment or nets if the vessel takes an observer and does not intentionally deploy nets on, or encircle, dolphins, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe; and

                (xii) containing such other restrictions and requirements as the Secretary determines are necessary to implement the International Dolphin Conservation Program with respect to vessels of the United States.

            (C)  __Adjustments to requirements__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary may make such adjustments as may be appropriate to requirements of subparagraph (B) that pertain to fishing gear, vessel equipment, and fishing practices to the extent the adjustments are consistent with the International Dolphin Conservation Program.

    (b) __Consultation__ 

        In developing any regulation under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State, the Marine Mammal Commission, and the United States Commissioners to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission appointed under [section 952 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s952].

    (c) __Emergency regulations__ 

        (1)

         If the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best scientific information available (including research conducted under [section 1414a of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1414a] and information obtained under the International Dolphin Conservation Program) that the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals authorized under this subchapter is having, or is likely to have, a significant adverse impact on a marine mammal stock or species, the Secretary shall—

            (A) notify the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission of his or her determination, along with recommendations to the Commission as to actions necessary to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury and mitigate such adverse impact; and

            (B) prescribe emergency regulations to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury and mitigate such adverse impact.

        (2) Before taking action under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State, the Marine Mammal Commission, and the United States Commissioners to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.

        (3)

         Emergency regulations prescribed under this subsection—

            (A) shall be published in the Federal Register, together with an explanation thereof;

            (B) shall remain in effect for the duration of the applicable fishing year; and

            (C) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination if the Secretary determines that the reasons for the emergency action no longer exist.

        (4) If the Secretary finds that the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is continuing to have a significant adverse impact on a stock or species, the Secretary may extend the emergency regulations for such additional periods as may be necessary.

        (5)

         Within 120 days after the Secretary notifies the United States Commissioners to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission of the Secretary’s determination under paragraph (1)(A), the United States Commissioners shall call for a special meeting of the Commission to address the actions necessary to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury and mitigate the adverse impact which resulted in the determination. The Commissioners shall report the results of the special meeting in writing to the Secretary and to the Secretary of State. In their report, the Commissioners shall—

            (A) include a description of the actions taken by the harvesting nations or under the International Dolphin Conservation Program to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury and measures to mitigate the adverse impact on the marine mammal species or stock;

            (B) indicate whether, in their judgment, the actions taken address the problem adequately; and

            (C) if they indicate that the actions taken do not address the problem adequately, include recommendations of such additional action to be taken as may be necessary.
