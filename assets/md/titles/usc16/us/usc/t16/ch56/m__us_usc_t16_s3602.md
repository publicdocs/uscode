## § 3602. United States representation on Council and Commissions

    (a) __Appointment and qualifications of Commissioners__ 

        The United States shall be represented on the Council and Commissions by three United States Commissioners to be appointed by the President to serve at his pleasure. Of such Commissioners, one shall be an official of the United States Government, and two shall be individuals (not officials of the United States Government) who are knowledgeable or experienced concerning the conservation and management of salmon of United States origin.

    (b) __Alternate Commissioners__ 

        The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, may designate alternate United States Commissioners. In the absence of a Commissioner appointed under subsection (a) of this section, an alternate Commissioner may exercise at any meeting of the Organization, the Council, or any Commission all functions of such Commissioner.

    (c) __Limited Federal employee status__ 

        Individuals who serve as Commissioners and alternate Commissioners shall not receive any compensation for such service. Such individuals shall not be considered to be Federal employees while performing such service, except for purposes of injury compensation or tort claims liability as provided in chapter 81 of title 5 and chapter 171 of title 28.

    (d) __Consultation with other parties__ 

        In carrying out their functions under the Convention, the Commissioners may consult with the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils established by section 302 of the Act of 1976 ([16 U.S.C. 1852][/us/usc/t16/s1852]), and may consult with such other interested parties as they consider appropriate. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. et seq.) shall not apply to consultations described in this subsection.
