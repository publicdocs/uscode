        (2) __Approval of State programs__ 

            (A) __Program approval__ 

                Not later than 30 days after the submission of a program under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Commerce shall approve the program unless the Secretary finds that the program will result in the export of unprocessed timber from public lands in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title and publishes that finding in the Federal Register.

                If the Secretary of Commerce approves a program submitted under paragraph (1), the Governor of the State for which the program was submitted, or such other official of that State as the Governor may designate, may administer and enforce the program, which shall apply in that State in lieu of the regulations issued under subsection (c).

    (g) __Presidential authority__ 

        The President is authorized, after suitable notice and a public comment period of not less than 120 days, to suspend the provisions of this section if a panel of experts has reported to the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization (as the term “World Trade Organization” is defined in [section 3501(8) of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s3501/8]), or a ruling issued under the formal dispute settlement proceeding provided under any other trade agreement finds, that the provisions of this section are in violation of, or inconsistent with, United States obligations under that trade agreement.

    (h) __Removal or modifications of State restrictions__ 

        Based upon a determination that it is in the national economic interest, the President may remove or modify any prohibition on exports from public lands in a State if that State petitions the President to remove or modify such prohibition.

    (i) __Effect of prior Federal law__ 

        No provision of Federal law which imposes requirements with respect to the generation of revenue from State timberlands and was enacted before August 20, 1990, shall be construed to invalidate, supersede, or otherwise affect any action of a State or political subdivision of a State pursuant to sections 620 to 620j of this title.

    (j) __Surplus timber__

Any such determination may, by rule, be withdrawn by the Secretary concerned if the Secretary determines that the affected timber is no longer surplus to the needs of timber manufacturing facilities in the United States.

    (k) __Suspension of prohibitions__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, beginning on January 1, 1998, and annually thereafter, if the President finds, upon review of the purposes and implementation of sections 620 to 620j of this title, that the prohibitions on exports required by subsection (a) no longer promote the purposes of sections 620 to 620j of this title, then the President may suspend such prohibitions, except that such suspension shall not take effect until 90 days after the President notifies the Congress of such finding.

    (l) __Existing authority not affected__ 

        Nothing in sections 620 to 620j of this title shall be construed to limit the authority of the President or the United States Trade Representative to take action authorized by law to respond appropriately to any measures taken by a foreign government in connection with sections 620 to 620j of this title.
