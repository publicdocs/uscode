## § 620i. Eastern hardwoods study

    (a) __Study__ 

    The Secretary of Commerce, in conjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, shall conduct a study of the export from the United States, during the 2-year period beginning on January 1, 1991, of unprocessed hardwood timber harvested from Federal lands or public lands east of the 100th meridian. In order to carry out the provisions of this section—

        (1) the Secretary of Commerce shall require each person exporting such timber from the United States to declare, in addition to the information normally required in the Shipper’s Export Declarations, the State in which the timber was grown and harvested; and

        (2) the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that all hardwood saw timber harvested from Federal lands east of the 100th meridian is marked in such a manner as to make it readily identifiable at all times before its manufacture, and shall take such steps as each Secretary considers appropriate to ensure that such markings are not altered or destroyed before manufacturing.

    (b) __Report to Congress__ 

        Not later than April 1, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to the Committees on Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report describing the volume and value of unprocessed timber grown and harvested from Federal lands or public lands east of the 100th meridian that is exported from the United States during the 2-year period beginning on January 1, 1991, the country to which such timber is exported, and the State in which such timber was grown and harvested.
