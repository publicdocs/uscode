            (A) __In general__

                (i) the benefits of the requirements outweigh the cost of complying with the requirements; and

                (ii)

                    (I) would be exported in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title; or

                    (II) if the unprocessed timber originated from Federal lands, would be substituted for unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th Meridian in the contiguous 48 States in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title.

                (i) the risk of unprocessed timber of that species, grade, and size being exported or used in substitution;

                (ii) the location of the unprocessed timber and the effect of the location on its being exported or used in substitution;

                (iii) the history of the person involved with respect to compliance with log painting and branding requirements; and

                (iv) any other factor that is relevant to determining the likelihood of the unprocessed timber being exported or used in substitution.

        (5) __Reporting__ 

            (A) __In general__

                (ii) __Review and termination of waivers__ 

                A waiver granted under clause (i)—

                    (I) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be reviewed once a year; and

                    (II) shall remain effective until terminated by the Secretary.
