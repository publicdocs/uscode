        (4)

         each person who transfers to another person unprocessed timber originating from public lands in a State that is subject to an order issued by the Secretary of Commerce under [section 620c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s620c/a], other than a State that is administering and enforcing a program under [section 620c(d) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s620c/d], shall, before completing the transfer—

    (c) __Civil penalties for violation__ 

        (1) __Exports__ 

            (A) If the Secretary concerned finds, on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, that a person, with willful disregard for the prohibition contained in sections 620 to 620j of this title against exporting Federal timber, exported or caused to be exported unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title, such Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is greater.

            (B)

                (i) Subject to clause (ii), if the Secretary of Commerce finds, on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, that a person, with willful disregard for the restrictions contained in an order of the Secretary under [section 620c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s620c/a] on exports of unprocessed timber from public lands, exported or caused to be exported unprocessed timber originating from public lands in violation of such order, the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is greater.

                (ii) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to exports of unprocessed timber originating from public lands in a State that is administering and enforcing a program under [section 620c(d) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s620c/d].

        (2) __Other violations__ 

            (A)

             If the Secretary concerned finds, on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, that a person has violated any provision of sections 620 to 620j of this title or any regulation issued under sections 620 to 620j of this title relating to lands which they administer (notwithstanding that such violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title), such Secretary may—

                (i) assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $75,000 for each violation if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation;

                (ii) assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation if the Secretary determines that the person should have known that the action constituted a violation; or

                (iii) assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation willfully.

            (B)

                (i) Subject to clause (ii), if the Secretary of Commerce finds, on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, that a person has violated, on or after June 1, 1993, any provision of sections 620 to 620j of this title or any regulation issued under sections 620 to 620j of this title relating to the export of unprocessed timber originating from public lands (whether or not the violation caused the export of unprocessed timber from public lands in violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title), the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty to the same extent as the Secretary concerned may impose a penalty under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A).

                (ii) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to unprocessed timber originating from public lands in a State that is administering and enforcing a program under [section 620c(d) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s620c/d].

            (C) __Mitigation of penalties.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                The Secretary concerned—

                    (I) in determining the applicability of any penalty imposed under this paragraph, shall take into account all relevant mitigating factors, including mistake, inadvertence, and error; and

                    (II)

                     based on any mitigating factor, may, with respect to any penalty imposed under this paragraph—

                        (aa) reduce the penalty;

                        (bb) not impose the penalty; or

                        (cc) on condition of there being no further violation under this paragraph for a prescribed period, suspend imposition of the penalty.

                (ii)  __Contractural __  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. Probably should be “Contractual”.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __ remedies__  __.—__ 

                In the case of a minor violation of sections 620 to 620j of this title (including a regulation), the Secretary concerned shall, to the maximum extent practicable, permit a contracting officer to redress the violation in accordance with the applicable timber sale contract rather than assess a penalty under this paragraph.

        (3) __Penalties not exclusive; judicial review__ 

            A penalty assessed under this subsection shall not be exclusive of any other penalty provided by law and shall be subject to review in an appropriate United States district court.

    (d) __Administrative remedies__ 

        (1) __Debarment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the head of the appropriate Federal department or agency under sections 620 to 620j of this title may debar any person who violates sections 620 to 620j of this title, or any regulation or contract issued under sections 620 to 620j of this title, from entering into any contract for the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands for a period of not more than 5 years. Such person shall also be precluded from taking delivery of Federal timber purchased by another party for the period of debarment.

            (B) __Prerequisites for debarment__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    No person may be debarred from bidding for or entering into a contract for the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands under subparagraph (A) unless the head of the appropriate Federal department or agency first finds, on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, that debarment is warranted.

                (ii) __Withholding of awards during debarment proceedings__ 

                    The head of an appropriate Federal department or agency may withhold an award under sections 620 to 620j of this title of a contract for the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands during a debarment proceeding.

            The head of the appropriate Federal department or agency under sections 620 to 620j of this title may cancel any contract entered into with a person found to have violated sections 620 to 620j of this title or regulations issued under sections 620 to 620j of this title.
