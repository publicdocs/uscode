        (A) fire regimes on the land have been moderately altered from historical ranges;

        (B) there exists a moderate risk of losing key ecosystem components from fire;

        (C)

         fire frequencies have increased or decreased from historical frequencies by 1 or more return intervals, resulting in moderate changes to—

            (i) the size, frequency, intensity, or severity of fires; or

            (ii) landscape patterns; and

        (D) vegetation attributes have been moderately altered from the historical range of the attributes.

    (5) __Condition class 3__ 

    The term “condition class 3”, with respect to an area of Federal land, means the condition class description developed by the Rocky Mountain Research Station in the general technical report referred to in paragraph (4) (including any subsequent revision to the report), under which—

        (A) fire regimes on land have been significantly altered from historical ranges;

        (B) there exists a high risk of losing key ecosystem components from fire;

        (C)

         fire frequencies have departed from historical frequencies by multiple return intervals, resulting in dramatic changes to—

            (i) the size, frequency, intensity, or severity of fires; or

            (ii) landscape patterns; and

        (D) vegetation attributes have been significantly altered from the historical range of the attributes.

    (6) __Day__ 

    The term “day” means—

        (A) a calendar day; or

        (B) if a deadline imposed by this subchapter would expire on a nonbusiness day, the end of the next business day.

    (7) __Decision document__ 

    The term “decision document” means—

        (A) a decision notice (as that term is used in the Forest Service Handbook);

        (B) a decision record (as that term is used in the Bureau of Land Management Handbook); and

        (C) a record of decision (as that term is used in applicable regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality).

    (8) __Fire regime I__ 

    The term “fire regime I” means an area—

        (A) in which historically there have been low-severity fires with a frequency of 0 through 35 years; and

        (B) that is located primarily in low elevation forests of pine, oak, or pinyon juniper.

    (9) __Fire regime II__ 

    The term “fire regime II” means an area—

        (A) in which historically there are stand replacement severity fires with a frequency of 0 through 35 years; and

        (B) that is located primarily in low- to mid-elevation rangeland, grassland, or shrubland.

    (10) __Fire regime III__ 

    The term “fire regime III” means an area—

        (A) in which historically there are mixed severity fires with a frequency of 35 through 100 years; and

        (B) that is located primarily in forests of mixed conifer, dry Douglas fir, or wet Ponderosa pine.

    (11) __Implementation Plan__ 

        The term “Implementation Plan” means the Implementation Plan for the Comprehensive Strategy for a Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment, dated May 2002, developed pursuant to the conference report to accompany the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (House Report No. 106–64) (and subsequent revisions).

    (12) __Municipal water supply system__
