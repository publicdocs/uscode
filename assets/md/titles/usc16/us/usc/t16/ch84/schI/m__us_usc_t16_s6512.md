## § 6512. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects

    (a) __Authorized projects__ 

    As soon as practicable after December 3, 2003, the Secretary shall implement authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects, consistent with the Implementation Plan, on—

        (1) Federal land in wildland-urban interface areas;

        (2) condition class 3 Federal land, in such proximity to a municipal water supply system or a stream feeding such a system within a municipal watershed that a significant risk exists that a fire disturbance event would have adverse effects on the water quality of the municipal water supply or the maintenance of the system, including a risk to water quality posed by erosion following such a fire disturbance event;

        (3) condition class 2 Federal land located within fire regime I, fire regime II, or fire regime III, in such proximity to a municipal water supply system or a stream feeding such a system within a municipal watershed that a significant risk exists that a fire disturbance event would have adverse effects on the water quality of the municipal water supply or the maintenance of the system, including a risk to water quality posed by erosion following such a fire disturbance event;

        (4) Federal land on which windthrow or blowdown, ice storm damage, the existence of an epidemic of disease or insects, or the presence of such an epidemic on immediately adjacent land and the imminent risk it will spread, poses a significant threat to an ecosystem component, or forest or rangeland resource, on the Federal land or adjacent non-Federal land; and

        (5)

         Federal land not covered by paragraphs (1) through (4) that contains threatened and endangered species habitat, if—

            (A) natural fire regimes on that land are identified as being important for, or wildfire is identified as a threat to, an endangered species, a threatened species, or habitat of an endangered species or threatened species in a species recovery plan prepared under [section 1533 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1533], or a notice published in the Federal Register determining a species to be an endangered species or a threatened species or designating critical habitat;

            (B) the authorized hazardous fuel reduction project will provide enhanced protection from catastrophic wildfire for the endangered species, threatened species, or habitat of the endangered species or threatened species; and

            (C) the Secretary complies with any applicable guidelines specified in any management or recovery plan described in subparagraph (A).

    (b) __Relation to agency plans__ 

        An authorized hazardous fuel reduction project shall be conducted consistent with the resource management plan and other relevant administrative policies or decisions applicable to the Federal land covered by the project.

    (c) __Acreage limitation__ 

        Not more than a total of 20,000,000 acres of Federal land may be treated under authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects.

    (d) __Exclusion of certain Federal land__ 

    The Secretary may not conduct an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project that would occur on—

        (1) a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System;

        (2) Federal land on which the removal of vegetation is prohibited or restricted by Act of Congress or Presidential proclamation (including the applicable implementation plan); or

        (3) a Wilderness Study Area.

            (B) __Covered project__ 

                The term “covered project” means an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project carried out on land described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (5) of subsection (a).

            (C) __Management direction__ 

                The term “management direction” means definitions, designations, standards, guidelines, goals, or objectives established for an old growth stand under a resource management plan developed in accordance with applicable law, including [section 1604(g)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1604/g/3/B].

            (D) __Old growth stand__ 

                The term “old growth stand” has the meaning given the term under management direction used pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4), based on the structure and composition characteristic of the forest type, and in accordance with applicable law, including [section 1604(g)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1604/g/3/B].

        (2) __Project requirements__ 

            In carrying out a covered project, the Secretary shall fully maintain, or contribute toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands according to the pre-fire suppression old growth conditions characteristic of the forest type, taking into account the contribution of the stand to landscape fire adaptation and watershed health, and retaining the large trees contributing to old growth structure.

        (3) __Newer management direction__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the management direction for an old growth stand was established on or after December 15, 1993, the Secretary shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2) in carrying out a covered project by implementing the management direction.

            (B) __Amendments or revisions__ 

                Any amendment or revision to management direction for which final administrative approval is granted after December 3, 2003, shall be consistent with paragraph (2) for the purpose of carrying out covered projects.

        (4) __Older management direction__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the management direction for an old growth stand was established before December 15, 1993, the Secretary shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2) in carrying out a covered project during the applicable period by implementing the management direction.

            (B) __Review required__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (C), during the applicable period for management direction referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall—

                (i) review the management direction for affected covered projects, taking into account any relevant scientific information made available since the adoption of the management direction; and

                (ii) amend the management direction for affected covered projects to be consistent with paragraph (2), if necessary to reflect relevant scientific information the Secretary did not consider in formulating the management direction.

            (C) __Review not completed__ 

            If the Secretary does not complete the review of the management direction in accordance with subparagraph (B) before the end of the applicable period, the Secretary shall not carry out any portion of affected covered projects in stands that are identified as old growth stands (based on substantial supporting evidence) by any person during scoping, within the period—

                (i) beginning at the close of the applicable period for the management direction governing the affected covered projects; and

                (ii)

                 ending on the earlier of—

                    (I) the date the Secretary completes the action required by subparagraph (B) for the management direction applicable to the affected covered projects; or

        Except in old growth stands where the management direction is consistent with subsection (e)(2), the Secretary shall carry out a covered project in a manner that—

            (A) focuses largely on small diameter trees, thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and prescribed fire to modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected reduction of uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil impacts, tree mortality or other impacts); and

            (B) maximizes the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire-resilient stands.

        (2) __Wildfire risk__ 

            Nothing in this subsection prevents achievement of the purposes described in [section 6501(1) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s6501/1].
