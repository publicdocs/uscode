## § 6501. Purposes

    The purposes of this chapter are—

    (1) to reduce wildfire risk to communities, municipal water supplies, and other at-risk Federal land through a collaborative process of planning, prioritizing, and implementing hazardous fuel reduction projects;

    (2) to authorize grant programs to improve the commercial value of forest biomass (that otherwise contributes to the risk of catastrophic fire or insect or disease infestation) for producing electric energy, useful heat, transportation fuel, and petroleum-based product substitutes, and for other commercial purposes;

    (3) to enhance efforts to protect watersheds and address threats to forest and rangeland health, including catastrophic wildfire, across the landscape;

    (4) to promote systematic gathering of information to address the impact of insect and disease infestations and other damaging agents on forest and rangeland health;

    (5) to improve the capacity to detect insect and disease infestations at an early stage, particularly with respect to hardwood forests; and

    (6)

     to protect, restore, and enhance forest ecosystem components—

        (A) to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered species;

        (B) to improve biological diversity; and

        (C) to enhance productivity and carbon sequestration.
