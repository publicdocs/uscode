    Information concerning the nature and location of any archaeological resource for which the excavation or removal requires a permit or other permission under this chapter or under any other provision of Federal law may not be made available to the public under subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 or under any other provision of law unless the Federal land manager concerned determines that such disclosure would—

        (1) further the purposes of this chapter or chapter 3125 of title 54, and

        (2) not create a risk of harm to such resources or to the site at which such resources are located.

    (b) __Request for disclosure by Governors__ 

    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, upon the written request of the Governor of any State, which request shall state—

        (2) the purpose for which such information is sought,

        (3) a commitment by the Governor to adequately protect the confidentiality of such information to protect the resource from commercial exploitation,

        the Federal land manager concerned shall provide to the Governor information concerning the nature and location of archaeological resources within the State of the requesting Governor.
