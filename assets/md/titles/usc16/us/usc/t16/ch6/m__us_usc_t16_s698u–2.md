        The Preserve shall consist of the lands and interests in land, including approximately 10,894 acres, generally depicted on the map entitled “Boundary Map, Flint Hills Prairie National Monument” numbered NM–TGP 80,000 and dated June 1994, more particularly described in the deed filed at 8:22 a.m. on June 3, 1994, with the Office of the Register of Deeds in Chase County, Kansas, and recorded in Book L–106 at pages 328 through 339, inclusive.
