    In the interest of maintaining the ecological integrity of the preserve, the Secretary shall limit the construction of roads, vehicular campgrounds, employee housing, and other public use and administrative facilities and he shall promulgate and publish such rules and regulations in the Federal Register as he deems necessary and appropriate to limit and control the use of, and activities on, Federal lands and waters with respect to:

        (2) exploration for, and extraction of, oil, gas, and other minerals;

        (3) new construction of any kind;

        The Secretary shall permit hunting, fishing, and trapping on lands and waters under his jurisdiction within the preserve in accordance with the applicable laws of the United States and the State of Texas, except that he may designate zones where and periods when, no hunting, fishing, trapping, or entry may be permitted for reasons of public safety, administration, floral and faunal protection and management, or public use and enjoyment. Except in emergencies, any regulations prescribing such restrictions relating to hunting, fishing, or trapping shall be put into effect only after consultation with the appropriate State agency having jurisdiction over hunting, fishing and trapping activities.
