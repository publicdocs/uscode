 __References in Text__ 

    The Federal Tort Claims Act, referred to in subsec. (f), is title IV of [act Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753], [60 Stat. 842][/us/stat/60/842], which was classified principally to chapter 20 (§§ 921, 922, 931–934, 941–946) of former Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary. Title IV of act Aug. 2, 1946, was substantially repealed and reenacted as sections 1346(b) and 2671 et seq. of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, by [act June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 992][/us/stat/62/992], the first section of which enacted Title 28. The Federal Tort Claims Act is also commonly used to refer to chapter 171 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. For complete classification of title IV to the Code, see Tables. For distribution of former sections of Title 28 into the revised Title 28, see Table at the beginning of Title 28.

    The Ethics in Government Act, referred to in subsec. (f), probably means the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, [Pub. L. 95–521][/us/pl/95/521], Oct. 26, 1978, [92 Stat. 1824][/us/stat/92/1824], as amended. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 101 of Pub. L. 95–521][/us/pl/95/521/s101] in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    2005—Subsec. (e)(2). [Pub. L. 109–132, § 3(1)][/us/pl/109/132/s3/1], substituted “Except as provided in paragraph (3), trustees” for “Trustees”.

    Subsec. (e)(3). [Pub. L. 109–132, § 3(2)][/us/pl/109/132/s3/2], designated existing provisions as subpar. (A), inserted subpar. heading, and added subpars. (B) and (C).

 __Compensation for Trustees__ 

[Pub. L. 106–291, title II][/us/pl/106/291], Oct. 11, 2000, [114 Stat. 968][/us/stat/114/968], provided in part: 

> “That notwithstanding the limitations of 107(e)(2) of the Valles Caldera Preservation Act ([Public Law 106–248][/us/pl/106/248]) \[[16 U.S.C. 698v–5(e)(2)][/us/usc/t16/s698v–5/e/2]\], for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the members of the Board of Trustees of the Valles Caldera Trust may receive, upon request, compensation for each day (including travel time) that they are engaged in the performance of the functions of the Board. Compensation shall not exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate in effect for members of the Senior Executive Service at the ES–1 level, and shall be in addition to any reimbursement for travel, subsistence and other necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. Members of the Board who are officers or employees of the United States shall not receive any additional compensation by reason of service on the Board”.
