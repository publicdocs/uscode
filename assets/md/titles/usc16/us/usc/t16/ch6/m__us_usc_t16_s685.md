([Jan. 24, 1905, ch. 137, § 2][/us/act/1905-01-24/ch137/s2], [33 Stat. 614][/us/stat/33/614]; [June 29, 1906, ch. 3593, § 2][/us/act/1906-06-29/ch3593/s2], [34 Stat. 607][/us/stat/34/607]; 1939 Reorg. Plan No. II, § 4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, [53 Stat. 1433][/us/stat/53/1433]; [June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], §§ 8, 9, [62 Stat. 860][/us/stat/62/860].)

 __Codification__ 

    Words “in the Wichita National Forest and in the Grand Canyon National Forest” inserted, and “Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively” substituted for “Secretary of Agriculture” because of Reorg. Plan No. II of 1939, which transferred Bureau of Biological Survey from Department of Agriculture to Department of the Interior. The successor to Wichita National Forest, which was then administered by that Bureau, was affected by the transfer. However, the successor to Grand Canyon National Forest was administered by Forest Service and was consequently not affected.

    For successors to Wichita National Forest and Grand Canyon National Forest, see Presidential Designation note set out under [section 684 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s684].

 __Amendments__ 

    1948—Act June 25, 1948, struck out penal provisions. See [section 41 of Title 18][/us/usc/t18/s41], Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

 __Effective Date of 1948 Amendment__ 

    Section 20 of act June 25, 1948, provided that the amendment made by that act is effective Sept. 1, 1948.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    Transfer of functions of Secretary of Agriculture to Secretary of the Interior by Reorg. Plan No. II of 1939, see Transfer of Functions note set out under [section 671 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s671].
