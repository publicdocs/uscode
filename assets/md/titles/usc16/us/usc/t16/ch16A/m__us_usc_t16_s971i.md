## § 971i. Research on Atlantic highly migratory species

    (a) __Omitted__ 

    (b) __Highly migratory species research and monitoring__ 

        (1)

         Within 6 months after November 3, 1995, the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the advisory committee established under section 4 of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 ([16 U.S.C. 971b][/us/usc/t16/s971b]) and in consultation with the United States Commissioners on the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (referred to elsewhere in this section as the “Commission”) and the Secretary of State, shall develop and implement a comprehensive research and monitoring program to support the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species that shall—

            (A) identify and define the range of stocks of highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean, including Atlantic bluefin tuna; and

            (B) provide for appropriate participation by nations which are members of the Commission.

        (2)

         The program shall provide for, but not be limited to—

            (A) statistically designed cooperative tagging studies;

            (B) genetic and biochemical stock analyses;

            (C) population censuses carried out through aerial surveys of fishing grounds and known migration areas;

            (D) adequate observer coverage and port sampling of commercial and recreational fishing activity;

            (E) collection of comparable real-time data on commercial and recreational catches and landings through the use of permits, logbooks, landing reports for charter operations and fishing tournaments, and programs to provide reliable reporting of the catch by private anglers;

            (F) studies of the life history parameters of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species;

            (G) integration of data from all sources and the preparation of data bases to support management decisions;

            (H) include a cooperative research program on Atlantic billfish based on the Southeast Fisheries Science Center Atlantic Billfish Research Plan of 2002; and

            (I) other research as necessary.

        (3)

         In developing a program under this section, the Secretary shall—

            (A) ensure that personnel and resources of each regional research center shall have substantial participation in the stock assessments and monitoring of highly migratory species that occur in the region;

            (B) provide for comparable monitoring of all United States fishermen to which the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 applies with respect to effort and species composition of catch and discards;

            (C) consult with relevant Federal and State agencies, scientific and technical experts, commercial and recreational fishermen, and other interested persons, public and private, and shall publish a proposed plan in the Federal Register for the purpose of receiving public comment on the plan; and

            (D) through the Secretary of State, encourage other member nations to adopt a similar program.
