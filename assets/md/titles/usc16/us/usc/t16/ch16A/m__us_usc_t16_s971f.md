## § 971f. Enforcement

    (a) __Particular powers__ 

    Any person authorized in accordance with the provisions of this chapter to enforce the provisions of this chapter and the regulations issued thereunder may—

        (1) with or without a warrant, board any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and inspect such vessel and its catch and, if as a result of such inspection, he has reasonable cause to believe that such vessel or any person on board is engaging in operations in violation of this chapter or any regulations issued thereunder, he may, with or without a warrant or other process, arrest such person;

        (2) arrest, with or without a warrant, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter or any regulation issued thereunder in his presence or view;

        (3) execute any warrant or other process issued by an officer or court of competent jurisdiction; and

        (4) seize, whenever and wherever lawfully found, all fish taken or retained by a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any regulations issued pursuant thereto. Any fish so seized may be disposed of pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or, if perishable, in a manner prescribed by regulation of the Secretary.

    (b) __International enforcement__ 

        To the extent authorized under the convention or by agreements between the United States and any contracting party concluded pursuant to [section 971c(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s971c/b] for international enforcement, the duly authorized officials of such party shall have the authority to carry out the enforcement activities specified in subsection (a) of this section with respect to persons or vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the officials of the United States authorized pursuant to this section shall have the authority to carry out the enforcement activities specified in subsection (a) of this section with respect to persons or vessels subject to the jurisdiction of such party, except that where any agreement provides for arrest or seizure of persons or vessels under United States jurisdiction it shall also provide that the person or vessel arrested or seized shall be promptly handed over to a United States enforcement officer or another authorized United States official.

    (c) __Bonds or stipulations__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 2464 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2464], when a warrant of arrest or other process in rem is issued in any cause under this section, the marshal or other officer shall stay the execution of such process, or discharge any fish seized if the process has been levied, on receiving from the claimant of the fish a bond or stipulation for the value of the property with sufficient surety to be approved by a judge of the district court having jurisdiction of the offense, conditioned to deliver the fish seized, if condemned, without impairment in value or, in the discretion of the court, to pay its equivalent value in money or otherwise to answer the decree of the court in such cause. Such bond or stipulation shall be returned to the court and judgment thereon against both the principal and sureties may be recovered in event of any breach of the conditions thereof as determined by the court. In the discretion of the accused, and subject to the direction of the court, the fish may be sold for not less than its reasonable market value at the time of seizure and the proceeds of such sale placed in the registry of the court pending judgment in the case.
