## § 5106. Secretarial action

    (a) __Secretarial review of Commission determination of noncompliance__ 

    Within 30 days after receiving a notification from the Commission under [section 5105(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5105/b] and after review of the Commission’s determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall make a finding on—

        (1) whether the State in question has failed to carry out its responsibility under [section 5104 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5104]; and

        (2) if so, whether the measures that the State has failed to implement and enforce are necessary for the conservation of the fishery in question.

    (b) __Consideration of comments__ 

    In making a finding under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall—

        (A) give careful consideration to the comments of the State that the Commission has determined under [section 5105(a) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5105/a] is not in compliance with a coastal fishery management plan, and provide such State, upon request, with the opportunity to meet with and present its comments directly to the Secretary; and

        (B) solicit and consider the comments of the Commission and the appropriate Councils.

    (c) __Moratorium__ 

        (1) Upon making a finding under subsection (a) of this section that a State has failed to carry out its responsibility under [section 5104 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5104] and that the measures it failed to implement and enforce are necessary for conservation, the Secretary shall declare a moratorium on fishing in the fishery in question within the waters of the noncomplying State. The Secretary shall specify the moratorium’s effective date, which shall be any date within 6 months after declaration of the moratorium.

        (2) If after a moratorium is declared under paragraph (1) the Secretary is notified by the Commission that the Commission is withdrawing under [section 5105(c) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5105/c] the determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall immediately determine whether the State is in compliance with the applicable plan. If so, the moratorium shall be terminated.

    (d) __Implementing regulations__ 

    The Secretary may issue regulations necessary to implement this section. Such regulations—

        (1) may provide for the possession and use of fish which have been produced in an aquaculture operation, subject to applicable State regulations; and

        (2)

         shall allow for retention of fish that are subject to a moratorium declared under this section and unavoidably taken as incidental catch in fisheries directed toward menhaden if—

            (A) discarding the retained fish is impracticable;

            (B) the retained fish do not constitute a significant portion of the catch of the vessel; and

            (C) retention of the fish will not, in the judgment of the Secretary, adversely affect the conservation of the species of fish retained.

    (e) __Prohibited acts during moratorium__ 

    During the time in which a moratorium under this section is in effect, it is unlawful for any person to—

        (1) violate the terms of the moratorium or of any implementing regulation issued under subsection (d) of this section;

        (2) engage in fishing for any species of fish to which the moratorium applies within the waters of the State subject to the moratorium;

        (3) land, attempt to land, or possess fish that are caught, taken, or harvested in violation of the moratorium or of any implementing regulation issued under subsection (d) of this section;

        (4) fail to return to the water immediately, with a minimum of injury, any fish to which the moratorium applies that are taken incidental to fishing for species other than those to which the moratorium applies, except as provided by regulations issued under subsection (d) of this section;

        (5) refuse to permit any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter to board a fishing vessel subject to such person’s control for purposes of conducting any search or inspection in connection with the enforcement of this chapter;

        (6) forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with any such authorized officer in the conduct of any search or inspection under this chapter;

    (g) __Civil forfeitures__ 

        (1) Any vessel (including its gear, equipment, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used, and any fish (or the fair market value thereof) taken or retained, in any manner, in connection with, or as the result of, the commission of any act that is unlawful under subsection (e) of this section, shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States as provided in section 310 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act ([16 U.S.C. 1860][/us/usc/t16/s1860]).

        (2) Any fish seized pursuant to this chapter may be disposed of pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or, if perishable, in a manner prescribed in regulation.

    (h) __Enforcement__
