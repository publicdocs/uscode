        Before January 1, 1998, the Secretary shall monitor, on a timely basis, landings of American lobster, and, if the Secretary determines that catches from vessels that take lobsters in the exclusive economic zone by a method other than pots or traps have increased significantly, then the Secretary may, consistent with the national standards in section 301 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1851][/us/usc/t16/s1851]\], and after opportunity for public comment and consultation with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, implement regulations under [section 5103(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5103/b] that are necessary for the conservation of American lobster.

    (c) __Regulations to remain in effect until plan implemented__ 

        Regulations issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall remain in effect until the Secretary implements regulations under [section 5103(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s5103/b] to implement a coastal fishery management plan for American lobster.
