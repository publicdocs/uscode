        Subject to [section 7128 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7128], if a resource advisory committee fails to comply with subsection (a) for a fiscal year, any project funds reserved by the participating county in the preceding fiscal year and remaining unobligated shall be available for use as part of the project submissions in the next fiscal year.

    (c) __Effect of rejection of projects__ 

        Subject to [section 7128 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7128], any project funds reserved by a participating county in the preceding fiscal year that are unobligated at the end of a fiscal year because the Secretary concerned has rejected one or more proposed projects shall be available for use as part of the project submissions in the next fiscal year.

    (d) __Effect of court orders__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If an approved project under this chapter is enjoined or prohibited by a Federal court, the Secretary concerned shall return the unobligated project funds related to the project to the participating county or counties that reserved the funds.
