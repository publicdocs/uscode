## § 742m. Relinquishment of exclusive legislative jurisdiction

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, may relinquish to a State, or to a Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States over all or part of any United States Fish and Wildlife Service lands or interests therein, including but not limited to National Wildlife Refuge System and National Fish Hatchery System lands, in that State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession. Relinquishment of exclusive legislative jurisdiction under this subsection may be accomplished (1) by filing with the Governor (or, if none, the chief executive officer) of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession concerned, a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance thereof, or (2) as the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession may otherwise provide.
