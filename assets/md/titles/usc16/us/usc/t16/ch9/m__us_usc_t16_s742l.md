        (1) direct the advance of funds which may be deposited in commercial banks or other financial institutions;

        (2) use appropriations for payment for information, rewards, or evidence concerning violations, without reference to any rewards to which such persons may otherwise be entitled by law, and any moneys subsequently recovered shall be reimbursed to the current appropriation; and
