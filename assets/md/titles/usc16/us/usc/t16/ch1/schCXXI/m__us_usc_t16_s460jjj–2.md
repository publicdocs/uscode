The United States Claims Court  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any such claim in accordance with [section 1491 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1491].

    (b) __Withdrawal__

    (c) __Reclamation__ 

        No mining activity involving any surface disturbance of lands or waters within such area, including disturbance through subsidence, shall be permitted except in accordance with requirements imposed by the Secretary, including requirements for reasonable reclamation of disturbed lands to a visual and hydrological condition as close as practical to their premining condition.

        The Secretary of Agriculture shall undertake and complete within 3 years after October 12, 1993, an expedited program to examine all unpatented mining claims, including those for which a patent application has been filed, within the recreation area. Upon determination by the Secretary of Agriculture that the elements of a contest are present, the Secretary of the Interior shall immediately determine the validity of such claims. If a claim is determined to be invalid, the Secretary shall promptly declare the claim to be null and void.

    (e) __Public purposes__ 

        The Secretary may utilize mineral materials from within the recreation area for public purposes such as maintenance and construction of roads, trails, and facilities as long as such use is compatible with the purposes of the recreation area.
