## § 430a–1. Revision of boundaries

    In order to consolidate the Federal ownership of lands in, and to facilitate protection and preservation of, Kings Mountain National Military Park, South Carolina, the boundaries are revised as follows:

    (1) Federally owned lands lying west of the easterly right-of-way line of State Route P–11–123, containing approximately two hundred acres, are excluded from the park;

    (2) Privately owned lands lying east of the easterly right-of-way line of State Route P–11–123, containing approximately eighty acres, are included in the park; and

    (3) Lands of the Mary Morris estate lying south of the southerly right-of-way line of the historic Yorkville-Shelbyville Road, and forming the triangle bounded by the new State Route P–11–86, the historic Yorkville-Shelbyville Road and the present park boundary (Old Houser tract), aggregating approximately sixty acres, are included in the park.
