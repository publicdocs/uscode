        The Secretary may from time to time make minor revisions in the boundaries of the park in accordance with [section 100506(c) of title 54][/us/usc/t54/s100506/c].

    (f) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), there are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 410r–5 to 410r–8 of this title.
