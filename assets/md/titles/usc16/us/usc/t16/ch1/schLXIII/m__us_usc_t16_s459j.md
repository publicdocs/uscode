    In order to preserve and protect the outstanding natural, scenic, scientific, ecologic, and historic values of certain lands, shoreline, and waters of the State of Florida, and to provide for public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment of the same, there is hereby established the Canaveral National Seashore (hereinafter referred to as the “seashore”), as generally depicted on the map entitled “Boundary Map, Canaveral National Seashore”, dated August 1974 and numbered NS–CAN–40,000A. Such seashore shall comprise approximately sixty-seven thousand five hundred acres within the area more particularly described by a line beginning at the intersection of State Highway 3 and State Road 402, thence generally easterly following State Road 402 to a point one-half mile offshore in the Atlantic Ocean, thence northwesterly along a line which is at each point one-half mile distant from the high water mark to Bethune Beach, thence inland in a generally westerly direction through Turner Flats and Shipyard Canal, thence northwesterly to the Intracoastal Waterway, thence southerly along the Intracoastal Waterway to the boundary of the Kennedy Space Center, thence southwesterly to United States Highway 1, thence southerly along State Highway 3 to the point of beginning. The boundary map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, District of Columbia. After advising the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, in writing, at least sixty days prior to making any boundary revisions, the Secretary may from time to time make minor revisions in the boundaries of the seashore by publication of a revised map or other boundary description in the Federal Register: Provided, That the total acreage included within the boundaries shall not exceed that enumerated in this section.
