## § 1a–2. Secretary of the Interior’s authorization of activities

In order to facilitate the administration of the national park system, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, under such terms and conditions as he may deem advisable, to carry out the following activities:

    (a) __Transportation__ 

        Provide transportation of employees located at isolated areas of the national park system and to members of their families, where (1) such areas are not adequately served by commercial transportation, and (2) such transportation is incidental to official transportation services.

    (b) __Recreation__ 

        Provide recreation facilities, equipment, and services for use by employees and their families located at isolated areas of the national park system.

    (c) __Advisory committees; compensation and travel expenses__ 

        Appoint and establish such advisory committees in regard to the functions of the National Park Service as he may deem advisable, members of which shall receive no compensation for their services as such but who shall be allowed necessary travel expenses as authorized by [section 5703 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5703].

    (d) __Park equipment purchases__ 

        Purchase field and special purpose equipment required by employees for the performance of assigned functions which shall be regarded and listed as park equipment.

    (e) __Services, resources, or water contracts__ 

    Enter into contracts which provide for the sale or lease to persons, States, or their political subdivisions, of services, resources, or water available within an area of the national park system, as long as such activity does not jeopardize or unduly interfere with the primary natural or historic resource of the area involved, if such person, State, or its political subdivision—

        (1) provides public accommodations or services within the immediate vicinity of an area of the national park system to persons visiting the area; and

        (2) has demonstrated to the Secretary that there are no reasonable alternatives by which to acquire or perform the necessary services, resources, or water.

    (f) __Vehicular air-conditioning__ 

        Acquire, and have installed, air-conditioning units for any Government-owned passenger motor vehicles used by the National Park Service, where assigned duties necessitate long periods in automobiles or in regions of the United States where high temperatures and humidity are common and prolonged.

    (g) __Exhibits and demonstrations; sale of products and services; contracts and cooperative arrangements; credits to appropriation__ 

    Sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41 products and services produced in the conduct of living exhibits and interpretive demonstrations in areas of the national park system, to enter into contracts including cooperative arrangements with respect to such living exhibits and interpretive demonstrations, and to credit the proceeds therefrom to the appropriation bearing the cost of such exhibits and demonstrations. Sixty percent of the fees paid by permittees for the privilege of entering into Glacier Bay for the period beginning on the first full fiscal year following November 12, 1996, shall be deposited into a special account and that such funds shall be available—

        (1) to the extent determined necessary, to acquire and preposition necessary and adequate emergency response equipment to prevent harm or the threat of harm to aquatic park resources from permittees; and

        (2) to conduct investigations to quantify any effect of permittees’ activity on wildlife and other natural resource values of Glacier Bay National Park. The investigations provided for in this subsection shall be designed to provide information of value to the Secretary, in determining any appropriate limitations on permittees’ activity in Glacier Bay. The Secretary may not impose any additional permittee operating conditions in the areas of air, water, and oil pollution beyond those determined and enforced by other appropriate agencies. When competitively awarding permits to enter Glacier Bay, the Secretary may take into account the relative impact particular permittees will have on park values and resources, provided that no operating conditions or limitations relating to noise abatement shall be imposed unless the Secretary determines, based on the weight of the evidence from all available studies including verifiable scientific information from the investigations provided for in this subsection, that such limitations or conditions are necessary to protect park values and resources. Fees paid by certain permittees for the privilege of entering into Glacier Bay shall not exceed $5 per passenger. For the purposes of this subsection, “certain permittee” shall mean a permittee which provides overnight accommodations for at least 500 passengers for an itinerary of at least 3 nights, and “permittee” shall mean a concessionaire providing visitor services within Glacier Bay. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the Secretary to require additional categories of permits in, or otherwise increase the number of permits to enter Glacier Bay National Park.

    (h) __Regulations; promulgation and enforcement__ 

        Promulgate and enforce regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to waters located within areas of the National Park System, including waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States: Provided, That any regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be complementary to, and not in derogation of, the authority of the United States Coast Guard to regulate the use of waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

    (i) __United States Park Police and other National Park Service employees; meals and lodging__ 

        Provide meals and lodging, as the Secretary deems appropriate, for members of the United States Park Police and other employees of the National Park Service, as he may designate, serving temporarily on extended special duty in areas of the National Park System, and for this purpose he is authorized to use funds appropriated for the expenses of the Department of the Interior.

    (j) __Cooperative research and training programs__ 

        Enter into cooperative agreements with public or private educational institutions, States, and their political subdivisions, for the purpose of developing adequate, coordinated, cooperative research and training programs concerning the resources of the National Park System, and, pursuant to any such agreements, to accept from and make available to the cooperator such technical and support staff, financial assistance for mutually agreed upon research projects, supplies and equipment, facilities, and administrative services relating to cooperative research units as the Secretary deems appropriate; except that this paragraph shall not waive any requirements for research projects that are subject to the Federal procurement regulations.

    (k) __Leases__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary may enter into a lease with any person or governmental entity for the use of buildings and associated property administered by the Secretary as part of the National Park System.

        (2) __Prohibited activities__ 

            The Secretary may not use a lease under paragraph (1) to authorize the lessee to engage in activities that are subject to authorization by the Secretary through a concessions contract, commercial use authorization, or similar instrument.

        (3) __Use__ 

        Buildings and associated property leased under paragraph (1)—

            (A) shall be used for an activity that is consistent with the purposes established by law for the unit in which the building is located;

            (B) shall not result in degradation of the purposes and values of the unit; and

            (C) shall be compatible with National Park Service programs.

        (4) __Rental amounts__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            With respect to a lease under paragraph (1)—

                (i) payment of fair market value rental shall be required; and

                (ii) [section 1302 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s1302] shall not apply.

            (B) __Adjustment__ 

                The Secretary may adjust the rental amount as appropriate to take into account any amounts to be expended by the lessee for preservation, maintenance, restoration, improvement, or repair and related expenses.

            (C) __Regulation__ 

                The Secretary shall promulgate regulations implementing this subsection that includes provisions to encourage and facilitate competition in the leasing process and provide for timely and adequate public comment.

        (5) __Special account__ 

            (A) __Deposits__ 

                Rental payments under a lease under paragraph (1) shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury of the United States.

        (1) __In general__ 

            Where a unit of the National Park System is located adjacent to or near a State or local park area, and cooperative management between the National Park Service and a State or local government agency of a portion of either park will allow for more effective and efficient management of the parks, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State or local government agency to provide for the cooperative management of the Federal and State or local park areas. The Secretary may not transfer administration responsibilities for any unit of the National Park System under this paragraph.

        (2) __Provision of goods and services__ 

            Under a cooperative management agreement, the Secretary may acquire from and provide to a State or local government agency goods and services to be used by the Secretary and the State or local governmental agency in the cooperative management of land.

        (3) __Assignment__ 

            An assignment arranged by the Secretary under [section 3372 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3372] of a Federal, State, or local employee for work in any Federal, State, or local land or an extension of such an assignment may be for any period of time determined by the Secretary and the State or local agency to be mutually beneficial.
