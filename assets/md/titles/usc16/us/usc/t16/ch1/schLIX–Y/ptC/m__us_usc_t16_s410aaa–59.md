Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the applicability of any provision of [section 1865(b) of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1865/b], subchapter III of chapter 1007 of title 54, the Clean Air Act ([42 U.S.C. 7401][/us/usc/t42/s7401] et seq.), or regulations applicable to oil and gas development as set forth in 36 CFR 9B.
