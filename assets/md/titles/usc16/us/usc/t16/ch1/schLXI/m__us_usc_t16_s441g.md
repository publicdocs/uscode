## § 441g. Orders to effectuate revision of boundaries; publication

    The revision of boundaries of the national park, as authorized in [section 441f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s441f], shall be accomplished by the issuance, by the Secretary of the Interior, of an appropriate order, or orders, such order or orders to be effective upon publication in the Federal Register: Provided, That federally owned land under the administrative jurisdiction of any other department or agency of the Federal Government shall be included within the park only with the approval of the head of such department or agency.

([May 7, 1952, ch. 244, § 2][/us/act/1952-05-07/ch244/s2], [66 Stat. 65][/us/stat/66/65]; [Pub. L. 95–625, title VI, § 611][/us/pl/95/625/s611], Nov. 10, 1978, [92 Stat. 3521][/us/stat/92/3521].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 441f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s441f], referred to in text, was in the original “sections 1 and 5 of this Act”. Section 1 of the Act is classified to [section 441f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s441f]. Section 5 is probably a reference to section 5 of the original bill, which would have authorized the inclusion of up to 4,000 acres of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation within the Badlands National Monument. Such section 5 was stricken from the bill by Senate amendment, and as enacted the Act contained only four sections.

 __Change of Name__ 

    Word “park” substituted in text for “monument” pursuant to [Pub. L. 95–625, § 611][/us/pl/95/625/s611], which is classified to [section 441e–1 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s441e–1] and which redesignated Badlands National Monument as Badlands National Park.
