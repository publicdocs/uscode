## § 460ww–2. Miscellaneous

    (a) __Lands and waters__ 

        The Secretary may acquire lands or interests in lands within the boundaries of the recreation area by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. When any tract of land is only partly within such boundaries, the Secretary may acquire all or any portion of the land outside of such boundaries in order to minimize the payment of severance costs.

    (b) __Jurisdiction__ 

        Lands, waters and interests therein within the recreation area which are administered by any other agency of the United States and which are not identified under [section 460ww–1 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s460ww–1] as directly related to the Summersville project and essential to the operation of that project shall be transferred without reimbursement to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary.

    (c) __Protection of existing project__ 

        Nothing in this Act shall impair or affect the requirements of [section 1102 of Public Law 99–662][/us/pl/99/662/s1102] or otherwise affect the authorities of any department or agency of the United States to carry out the project purposes of the Summersville project, including recreation. In releasing water from such project, in order to protect public health and safety and to provide for enjoyment of the resources within the recreation area, other departments and agencies of the United States shall cooperate with the Secretary to facilitate and enhance whitewater recreational use and other recreational use of the recreation area.
