## § 410aaa. Findings

    The Congress hereby finds that—

    (2) Death Valley National Monument is today recognized as a major unit of the National Park System, having extraordinary values enjoyed by millions of visitors;

    (3) the monument boundaries established in the 1930’s exclude and thereby expose to incompatible development and inconsistent management, contiguous Federal lands of essential and superlative natural, ecological, geological, archeological, paleontological, cultural, historical ad  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “and”. </sup></sup>  wilderness values;

    (4) Death Valley National Monument should be substantially enlarged by the addition of all contiguous Federal lands of national park caliber and afforded full recognition and statutory protection as a National Park; and

    (5) the wilderness within Death Valley should receive maximum statutory protection by designation pursuant to the Wilderness Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1131][/us/usc/t16/s1131] et seq.\].

>     “(2) Since 1936, the Tribe has lived and governed the affairs of the Tribe on approximately 40 acres of land near Furnace Creek in the Park.

>     “(3) The Tribe achieved Federal recognition in 1983 but does not have a land base within the Tribe’s ancestral homeland.

>     “(4) Since the Tribe commenced use and occupancy of the Furnace Creek area, the Tribe’s membership has grown. Tribal members have a desire and need for housing, government and administrative facilities, cultural facilities, and sustainable economic development to provide decent, safe, and healthy conditions for themselves and their families.

>     “(5) The interests of both the Tribe and the National Park Service would be enhanced by recognizing their coexistence on the same land and by establishing partnerships for compatible land uses and for the interpretation of the Tribe’s history and culture for visitors to the Park.

>     “(6) The interests of both the Tribe and the United States would be enhanced by the establishment of a land base for the Tribe and by further delineation of the rights and obligations of each with respect to the Furnace Creek area and to the Park as a whole.

> “SEC. 3. __PURPOSES.__ 

> “Consistent with the recommendations of the report required by section 705(b) of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 \[[16 U.S.C. 410aaa–75(b)][/us/usc/t16/s410aaa–75/b]\] ([Public Law 103–433][/us/pl/103/433]; [108 Stat. 4498][/us/stat/108/4498]), the purposes of this Act are—

>     “(6) to provide appropriate opportunities for economically viable and ecologically sustainable visitor-related development, by the Tribe within the Park, that is not in derogation of the purposes and values for which the Park was established; and
