## § 407r. Authorization of appropriations

    For the purpose of acquiring the property described in [section 407m of this title][/us/usc/t16/s407m], there is authorized to be appropriated not to exceed the sum of $12,792,000. Funds appropriated pursuant to this subchapter shall be available for any expenses incidental to acquisition of property as prescribed by this subchapter, including the employment of the necessary services in the District of Columbia, and including to the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior, the employment without regard to the civil-service laws of such experts and other officers and employees as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter efficiently and in the public interest.

([June 28, 1948, ch. 687, § 6][/us/act/1948-06-28/ch687/s6], [62 Stat. 1062][/us/stat/62/1062]; [July 10, 1952, ch. 653, § 3][/us/act/1952-07-10/ch653/s3], [66 Stat. 575][/us/stat/66/575]; [Pub. L. 85–764, § 3(b)][/us/pl/85/764/s3/b], Aug. 27, 1958, [72 Stat. 862][/us/stat/72/862]; [Pub. L. 91–293][/us/pl/91/293], June 25, 1970, [84 Stat. 333][/us/stat/84/333]; [Pub. L. 93–477, title I, § 101(5)][/us/pl/93/477/s101/5], Oct. 26, 1974, [88 Stat. 1445][/us/stat/88/1445].)

 __Codification__ 

    Provisions that authorized the employment of such experts and other officers and employees as are necessary to carry out this subchapter “without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, as amended”, were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exception contained in this section because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632] (the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, into law). [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorized the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

 __Amendments__ 

    1974—[Pub. L. 93–477][/us/pl/93/477] substituted “$12,792,000” for “$11,200,000”.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–293][/us/pl/91/293] substituted “$11,200,000” for “$7,950,000”.

    1958—[Pub. L. 85–764][/us/pl/85/764] substituted “$7,950,000” for “$7,700,000”.

    1952—Act July 10, 1952, substituted “$7,700,000” for “$4,435,000”.
