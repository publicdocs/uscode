## § 403h–1. Acceptance of jurisdiction by United States; saving provisions

    Sole and exclusive jurisdiction is assumed by the United States over certain lands within the States of North Carolina and Tennessee as may be acquired for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, saving, however, to the State of North Carolina and to the State of Tennessee, respectively, the right to serve civil or criminal process within the limits of the area ceded by such State in suits or prosecutions for or on account of any rights acquired, obligations incurred, or crimes committed in such State outside of said park; and saving further to each such State the right to tax persons and corporations, their franchises and property on the lands included in such ceded area; and saving also to the persons residing in said park now, or hereafter, the right to vote at all elections held within the county in which they reside; and saving further to each such State the right to tax sales in such ceded area of gasoline and other motor-vehicle fuels and oil for use in motor vehicles. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a consent by the United States to the taxation by the States of such sales for the exclusive use of the United States.
