For disposition of former sections of this title, see Disposition Table preceding [section 100101 of Title 54][/us/usc/t54/s100101].

L. 89–665][/us/pl/89/665], Oct. 15, 1966, [80 Stat. 915][/us/stat/80/915], known as the National Historic Preservation Act, which was classified generally to subchapter II (§ 470 et seq.) of chapter 1A of this title. The Act, except for section 1, was repealed and restated in division A (§ 300101 et seq.) of subtitle III of Title 54, National Park Service and Related Programs, by [Pub. L. 113–287][/us/pl/113/287], §§ 3, 7, Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 3094][/us/stat/128/3094], 3272. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.
