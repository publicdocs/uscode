## § 460m–6. Free-roaming horses

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary, in accordance with this section, shall allow free-roaming horses in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. Within 180 days after November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the Missouri Wild Horse League or another qualified nonprofit entity to provide for management of free-roaming horses. The agreement shall provide for cost-effective management of the horses and limit Federal expenditures to the costs of monitoring the agreement. The Secretary shall issue permits for adequate pastures to accommodate the historic population level of the free-roaming horse herd, which shall be not less than the number of horses in existence on November 12, 1996, nor more than 50.

    (b) __Removal of horses__ 

    The Secretary may not remove, or assist in, or permit the removal of any free-roaming horses from Federal lands within the boundary of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways unless—

        (1) the entity with whom the Secretary has entered into the agreement under subsection (a) of this section, following notice and a 90-day response period, substantially fails to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement;

        (2) the number of free-roaming horses exceeds 50; or

        (3) in the case of an emergency or to protect public health and safety, as defined in the agreement.

    (c) __Construction; liability of United States__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating liability for the United States for any damages caused by the free-roaming horses to property located inside or outside the boundaries of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.

 __Codification__ 

    November 12, 1996, referred to in subsec.

L. 104–333][/us/pl/104/333], which amended this section generally, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–333][/us/pl/104/333] amended section generally, substituting provisions relating to free-roaming horses for provisions relating to Ozark National Scenic Riverways Commission.
