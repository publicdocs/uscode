Following reasonable notice in writing to the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives of his intention to do so, the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the “Secretary”) may make minor revisions of the boundary of the park by publication of a revised map or other boundary description in the Federal Register.
