The following provisions are made with respect to additional needs of the leprosy patients and Native Hawaiians for employment and training.

    (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall give first preference to qualified patients and Native Hawaiians in making appointments to positions established for the administration of the park, and the appointment of patients and Native Hawaiians shall be without regard to any provision of the Federal civil service laws giving an employment preference to any other class of applicant and without regard to any numerical limitation on personnel otherwise applicable.

    (2) The Secretary shall provide training opportunities for patients and Native Hawaiians to develop skills necessary to qualify for the provision of visitor services and for appointment to positions referred to in paragraph (1).
