The additional acreage authorized by this section is in recognition of the historical significance of the Memorial site to the westward expansion of the United States and the historical linkage of this site on the Mississippi in both Missouri and Illinois to such expansion, the international recognition of the Gateway Arch, designed by Eero Saarinen, as one of the world’s great sculptural and architectural achievements, and the increasing use of the Memorial site by millions of people from all over the United States and the world.

    (b) Within the area designated in accordance with this section, the Secretary of the Interior may acquire lands and interests in lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, except that lands owned by the State of Illinois or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation.
