## § 410aaa–5. Grazing

    (a) __In general__ 

        The privilege of grazing domestic livestock on lands within the park shall continue to be exercised at no more than the current level, subject to applicable laws and National Park Service regulations.

    (b) __Sale of property__ 

        If a person holding a grazing permit referred to in subsection (a) of this section informs the Secretary that such permittee is willing to convey to the United States any base property with respect to which such permit was issued and to which such permittee holds title, the Secretary shall make the acquisition of such base property a priority as compared with the acquisition of other lands within the park, provided agreement can be reached concerning the terms and conditions of such acquisition. Any such base property which is located outside the park and acquired as a priority pursuant to this section shall be managed by the Federal agency responsible for the majority of the adjacent lands in accordance with the laws applicable to such adjacent lands.
