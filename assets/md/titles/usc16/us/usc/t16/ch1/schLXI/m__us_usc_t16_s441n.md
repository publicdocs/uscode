The lands acquired under paragraph (ii) shall become a part of the Badlands Air Force gunnery range retained by the Department of the Air Force. The United States and the Oglala Sioux Tribe shall reserve all mineral rights in the lands so conveyed.

        The Oglala Sioux Tribal Council may authorize the execution of the necessary instruments to effect the exchange on behalf of the tribe, and the Secretary may execute the necessary instruments on behalf of the United States.

    (c) __Trust title__ 

        After the exchange is effected the title of the Oglala Sioux Tribe to the property acquired by the exchange shall be held in trust subject to the same restrictions and authorities that apply to other lands of the tribe that are held in trust.
