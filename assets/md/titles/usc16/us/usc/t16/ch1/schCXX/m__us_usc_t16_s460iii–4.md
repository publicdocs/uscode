    (a) __Acquisitions__ 

        (1) The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests therein within the boundaries of the conservation area by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer from another Federal agency, except that such lands or interests owned by the State of Idaho or a political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange.

        (2) Any lands located within the boundaries of the conservation area that are acquired by the United States on or after August 4, 1993, shall become a part of the conservation area and shall be subject to this subchapter.

    (b) __Purchase of lands__ 

        In addition to the authority in [section 1748(d) of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1748/d] and notwithstanding section 460l–9(a)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, monies appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund may be used as authorized in [section 1534(b) of this title][/us/usc/t16/s1534/b], for the purposes of acquiring lands or interests therein within the conservation area for administration as public lands as a part of the conservation area.

    (c) __Land exchanges__ 

        The Secretary shall, within 4 years after August 4, 1993, study, identify, and initiate voluntary land exchanges which would resolve ownership related land use conflicts within the conservation area.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 460l–9(a) of this title, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “section 7(a) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1964 ([16 U.S.C. 460][/us/usc/t16/s460]l–9(a)),” and was translated as reading section 7(a) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
