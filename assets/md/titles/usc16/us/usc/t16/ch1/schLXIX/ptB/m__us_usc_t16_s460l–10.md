## § 460l–10. Availability of land and water conservation fund for publicity purposes; standardized temporary signing; standards and guidelines

    Moneys derived from the sources listed in section 460l–5 of this title shall not be available for publicity purposes: Provided, however, That in each case where significant acquisition or development is initiated, appropriate standardized temporary signing shall be located on or near the affected site, to the extent feasible, so as to indicate the action taken is a product of funding made available through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Such signing may indicate the per centum and dollar amounts financed by Federal and non-Federal funds, and that the source of the funding includes moneys derived from Outer Continental Shelf receipts. The Secretary shall prescribe standards and guidelines for the usage of such signing to assure consistency of design and application.
