## § 410nn. Establishment

    (a) __In general__ 

        In order to preserve and interpret the history and achievements of seafaring Americans and of the Nation’s maritime heritage, especially on the Pacific coast, there is hereby established the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “park”).

    (b) __Area included__ 

        The park shall consist of the lands and interests therein within the area generally depicted on the map entitled “Boundary Map, San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park”, numbered 641/80,053 and dated April 7, 1987. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior and in the office of the Superintendent of the park. If the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “Secretary”) determines, upon completion of the General Management Plan for the park, that the inclusion of the property at Jefferson and Hyde Streets, San Francisco, known as the Haslett Warehouse, would promote the purposes of the park, the Secretary may adjust the boundaries of the park to include that property after notification to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate. The Secretary may make other minor revisions of the boundary of the park in accordance with section 460l–9(c) of this title.

    (c) __Golden Gate National Recreation Area__ 

        The Secretary shall revise the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to exclude from the National Recreation Area the area within the park (as depicted on the boundary map referred to in subsection (b) of this section). The Secretary shall transfer to the jurisdiction of the park all real and personal property of the United States administered by the Secretary as part of the National Recreation Area located within the boundaries of the park (including the museum building), together with all vessels, marine collections, libraries, historic documents, equipment and other marine artifacts which are administered by the Secretary as part of the National Recreation Area and which relate to maritime history.

    (d) __Museum building__ 

        The building housing and displaying the marine collections, libraries, historic documents, equipment, and marine artifacts shall be named the “Sala Burton Building” and an appropriate plaque with this designation shall be prominently displayed as part of the structure.
