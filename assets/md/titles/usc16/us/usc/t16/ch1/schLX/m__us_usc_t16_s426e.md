## § 426e. Lands acquired declared national battlefield; name

    Upon the ceding of jurisdiction by the legislature of the State of Tennessee and the report of the Attorney General of the United States that a perfect title has been acquired, the lands acquired under the provisions of sections 426 to 426j of this title, together with the area already inclosed within the national cemetery at the battlefield of Stones River and the Government reservation in said battlefield upon which is erected a large monument to the memory of the officers and soldiers of General Hazen’s brigade who fell on the spot, are declared to be a national battlefield, to be known as the Stones River National Battlefield.
