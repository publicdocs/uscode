## § 460l–10c. Repeal of provisions prohibiting collection of recreation fees or user charges

    All other provisions of law that prohibit the collection of entrance, admission, or other recreation user fees or charges authorized by this part or that restrict the expenditure of funds if such fees or charges are collected are hereby also repealed: Provided, That no provision of any law or treaty which extends to any person or class of persons a right of free access to the shoreline of any reservoir or other body of water, or to hunting and fishing along or on such shoreline, shall be affected by this repealer.

([Pub. L. 88–578, title I, § 11][/us/pl/88/578/s11], formerly § 2(a) (in part), Sept. 3, 1964, [78 Stat. 899][/us/stat/78/899]; renumbered § 10, [Pub. L. 90–401, § 1(a)][/us/pl/90/401/s1/a], July 15, 1968, [82 Stat. 354][/us/stat/82/354]; renumbered § 11, [Pub. L. 92–347, § 2][/us/pl/92/347/s2], July 11, 1972, [86 Stat. 459][/us/stat/86/459].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This part, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 88–578][/us/pl/88/578], Sept. 3, 1964, [78 Stat. 897][/us/stat/78/897], which is classified principally to this part. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 460l–4 of this title and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    In addition to the text set out in the section above, the original contained provisions directing the repeal of [section 14 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s14] and the deletion of “, without charge,” in the sentence of [section 460d of this title][/us/usc/t16/s460d] beginning “The water areas of all such projects shall be open to public use generally”. The repeals and deletions called for by those provisions were executed as thus directed so that those provisions have been omitted from the text as executed.

    Section formerly constituted the fourth paragraph of [section 2(a) of Pub. L. 88–578][/us/pl/88/578/s2/a] which was classified to section 460l–5(a) of this title. The paragraph was lifted out of section 2(a) and redesignated section 10 by [section 1(a) of Pub. L. 90–401][/us/pl/90/401/s1/a], which, for purposes of classification, resulted in the designation of the paragraph as section 460l–10c of this title \[this section\].

 __Effective Date__ 

    Section effective Jan. 1, 1965, see note set out under section 460l–4 of this title. Transfer of the provisions of this section from section 460l–5(a) of this title to this section effective Dec. 31, 1971, see [section 1(d) of Pub. L. 90–401][/us/pl/90/401/s1/d], as amended by [section 1 of Pub. L. 91–308][/us/pl/91/308/s1], set out as an Effective Date of 1968 Amendment note under section 460l–5 of this title.
