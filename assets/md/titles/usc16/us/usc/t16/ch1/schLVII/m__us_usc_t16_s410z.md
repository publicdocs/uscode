    (b) __Acquisition of properties with appropriated funds__ 

        In the event that the properties described in this section are not donated to the United States or purchased with donated funds, they may be acquired by the Secretary with appropriated funds: Provided, That, except for privately held lands within the Charlestown Navy Yard as described in subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall not acquire any such properties by eminent domain so long as he determines that a binding, written cooperative agreement, assuring the preservation and historical integrity of such properties remains in force and effect. Lands owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or any of its political subdivisions, may be acquired only by donation.

    (c) __Publication of notice__ 

        At such time as the Secretary determines that sufficient lands, improvements, and interests therein have been acquired or that cooperative agreements satisfying the preservation and historical objective of this subchapter have been executed, he may establish the Boston National Historical Park by publication of notice to that effect in the Federal Register, together with a detailed description or map setting forth the properties included therein.

The Secretary shall consult with representatives of the city of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts concerning the development of suitable transportation plans consistent with the purposes for which the Navy Yard was included in the historical park and the Secretary is authorized to grant, in accordance with such terms and conditions as he deems necessary and consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, easements and rights-of-way to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any political subdivision thereof including the Boston Redevelopment Authority for purposes of the vehicular, pedestrian and utility access to that portion of the Boston Navy Yard outside the boundaries of the Park.
