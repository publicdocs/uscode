## § 410aaa–75. Native American uses and interests

    (a) __Access__ 

        In recognition of the past use of the National Park System units and wilderness areas designed under this Act by Indian people for traditional cultural and religious purposes, the Secretary shall ensure access to such park system units and wilderness areas by Indian people for such traditional cultural and religious purposes. In implementing this section, the Secretary, upon the request of an Indian tribe or Indian religious community, shall temporarily close to the general public use of one or more specific portions of the park system unit or wilderness area in order to protect the privacy of traditional cultural and religious activities in such areas by Indian people. Any such closure shall be made to affect the smallest practicable area for the minimum period necessary for such purposes. Such access shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of [Public Law 95–341][/us/pl/95/341] ([42 U.S.C. 1996][/us/usc/t42/s1996] \[, 1996a\]) commonly referred to as the “American Indian Religious Freedom Act”, and with respect to areas designated as wilderness, the Wilderness Act ([78 Stat. 890][/us/stat/78/890]; [16 U.S.C. 1131][/us/usc/t16/s1131]).

    (b) __Study__ 

        (1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe and relevant Federal agencies, shall conduct a study, subject to the availability of appropriations, to identify lands suitable for a reservation for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe that are located within the Tribe’s aboriginal homeland area within and outside the boundaries of the Death Valley National Monument and the Death Valley National Park, as described in part A of this subchapter.

        (2) Not later than 1 year after October 31, 1994, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the United States Senate, and the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1).
