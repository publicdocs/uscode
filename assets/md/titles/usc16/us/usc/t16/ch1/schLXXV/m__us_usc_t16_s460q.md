    In order to provide, in a manner coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley project, for the public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment of the Whiskeytown, Shasta, Clair Engle, and Lewiston reservoirs and surrounding lands in the State of California by present and future generations and the conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment of such lands and waters, there is hereby established, subject to valid existing rights, the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area in the State of California (hereinafter referred to as the “recreation area”). The boundaries of the recreation area, which consists of the Whiskeytown unit, the Shasta unit, and the Clair Engle-Lewiston unit, shall be those shown in drawing numbered BOR–WST 1004, dated July 1963, entitled “Proposed Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area”, which is on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, Department of the Interior. The Whiskeytown unit shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior; and the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston units shall be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, except that lands or waters needed or used for the operation of the Central Valley project shall continue to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior to the extent he determines to be required for such operation. The two Secretaries shall coordinate their planning and administration of the respective units in such manner as to provide integrated management policies for the recreation area as a whole for the purposes of this subchapter in order to bring about uniformity to the fullest extent feasible in the administration and use of the recreation area.
