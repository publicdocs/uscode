## § 230c. Cooperative agreements; specific provisions

    In furtherance of the purposes of this part, and after consultation with the Commission created by [section 230f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230f], the Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with the owners of properties of natural, historical, or cultural significance, including but not limited to the resources described in paragraphs (1) through (5)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of [section 230 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230], pursuant to which the Secretary may mark, interpret, restore and/or provide technical assistance for the preservation and interpretation of such properties, and pursuant to which the Secretary may provide assistance including management services, program implementation, and incremental financial assistance in furtherance of the standards for administration of the park pursuant to [section 230e of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230e]. Such agreements shall contain, but need not be limited to, provisions that the Secretary, through the National Park Service, shall have the right of access at all reasonable times to all public portions of the property covered by such agreement for the purpose of conducting visitors through such properties and interpreting them to the public, and that no changes or alterations shall be made in such properties except by mutual agreement between the Secretary and the other parties to such agreements. The agreements may contain specific provisions which outline in detail the extent of the participation by the Secretary in the restoration, preservation, interpretation, and maintenance of such properties.

([Pub. L. 95–625, title IX, § 904][/us/pl/95/625/s904], Nov. 10, 1978, [92 Stat. 3536][/us/stat/92/3536]; [Pub. L. 96–87, title IV, § 401(q)(2)][/us/pl/96/87/s401/q/2], Oct. 12, 1979, [93 Stat. 666][/us/stat/93/666].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Paragraphs (4) and (5) of [section 230 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230], included within the reference in text to paragraphs (1) through (5) of [section 230 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230], were redesignated paragraphs (5) and (6), respectively, of [section 230 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230], and a new paragraph (4) was added, by [Pub. L. 100–250, § 1(a)][/us/pl/100/250/s1/a], Feb. 16, 1988, [102 Stat. 16][/us/stat/102/16].

 __Amendments__ 

    1979—[Pub. L. 96–87][/us/pl/96/87] substituted reference to “[section 907 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s907]” for reference to “[section 7 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7]” in the original. Since “[section 7 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s7]” had already been translated as “[section 230f of this title][/us/usc/t16/s230f]” as the probable intent of Congress the substitution of “907” for “7” required no change in text as set out in this section.

 __“Secretary” Defined__ 

    Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior, see [section 2 of Pub. L. 95–625][/us/pl/95/625/s2], set out as a note under [section 2503 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s2503].
