## § 19f. Board: membership, term of office, vacancies, Chairman, Secretary, non-Federal office, quorum, seal, meetings, compensation, traveling and subsistence expenses; Foundation as successor to right, title, and interest of National Park Trust Fund Board in property or funds; abolition and repeal of National Park Trust Fund and Board provisions

    The National Park Foundation shall consist of a Board having as members the Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the National Park Service, ex officio, and no less than six private citizens of the United States appointed by the Secretary of the Interior whose initial terms shall be staggered to assure continuity of administration. Thereafter, the term shall be six years, unless a successor is chosen to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was chosen, in which event the successor shall be chosen only for the remainder of that term. The Secretary of the Interior shall be the Chairman of the Board and the Director of the National Park Service shall be the Secretary of the Board. Membership on the Board shall not be deemed to be an office within the meaning of the statutes of the United States. A majority of the members of the Board serving at any one time shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the Foundation shall have an official seal, which shall be judicially noticed. The Board shall meet at the call of the Chairman and there shall be at least one meeting each year.

    No compensation shall be paid to the members of the Board for their services as members, but they shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary traveling and subsistence expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties as such members out of National Park Foundation funds available to the Board for such purposes. The Foundation shall succeed to all right, title, and interest of the National Park Trust Fund Board established in any property or funds, including the National Park Trust Fund, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. The National Park Trust Fund is hereby abolished, and the Act of July 10, 1935 ([49 Stat. 477][/us/stat/49/477]), as amended, is hereby repealed.

([Pub. L. 90–209, § 2][/us/pl/90/209/s2], Dec. 18, 1967, [81 Stat. 656][/us/stat/81/656].)
