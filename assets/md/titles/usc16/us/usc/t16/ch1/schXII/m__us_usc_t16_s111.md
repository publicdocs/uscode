([June 29, 1906, ch. 3607][/us/act/1906-06-29/ch3607], §§ 1, 2, [34 Stat. 616][/us/stat/34/616], 617; [June 30, 1913, ch. 4][/us/act/1913-06-30/ch4], § 1, [38 Stat. 83][/us/stat/38/83].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section is based on sections 1 and 2 of act June 29, 1906, and a portion of section 1 of act June 30, 1913.

    The first sentence to the colon is from a part of section 1 of act June 29, 1906.

    The second paragraph is from section 1 of act June 30, 1913. It extended the park on the south and described the boundaries as thus changed, thereby superseding the description contained in section 1 of act June 29, 1906. Section 1 of act June 30, 1913, also recited that the lands added to the park by its provisions were lands relinquished by Indians pursuant to an agreement incorporated and ratified therein. The agreement was one dated May 10, 1911, with the Wiminuche Band of Southern Ute Indians.

    The last sentence of this section is taken from section 2 of act June 29, 1906, which is also the source of [section 112 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s112].
