## § 410yy–7. Financial and technical assistance

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary may provide to any owner of property within the park containing nationally significant historic or cultural resources, in accordance with cooperative agreements or grant agreements, as appropriate, such financial and technical assistance to mark, interpret, and restore non-Federal properties within the park as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, provided that—

        (1) the Secretary, acting through the National Park Service, shall have right of access at reasonable times to public portions of the property covered by such agreement for the purpose of conducting visitors through such properties and interpreting them to the public; and

        (2) no changes or alterations shall be made in such properties except by mutual agreement between the Secretary and the other parties to the agreements.

    (b) __Matching funds__ 

        Funds authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for the purposes of this section shall be expended in the ratio of $1 of Federal funds for each $1 of funds contributed by non-Federal sources. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to accept from non-Federal sources, and to utilize for purposes of this subchapter, any money so contributed. Donations of land, or interests in land, by the State of Michigan may be considered as a contribution from non-Federal sources for the purposes of this subsection.
