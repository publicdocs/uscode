## § 346e. Authorization for park facilities to be located outside the boundaries of Zion National Park and Yosemite National Park

In order to facilitate the administration of Zion National Park and Yosemite National Park, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, under such terms and conditions as he may deem advisable, to expend donated or appropriated funds for transportation systems or for the establishment of essential facilities for park administration and visitor use outside the boundaries, but within the vicinity, of the park. Such systems or facilities and the use thereof shall be in conformity with approved plans for the park. The Secretary shall use existing facilities wherever feasible. Such facilities may only be constructed by the Secretary upon a finding that the location of such facilities would—

    (1) avoid undue degradation of natural or cultural resources within the park;

    (2) enhance service to the public; or

    (3) provide a cost saving to the Federal Government.

        The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with State or local governments or private entities to undertake the authority granted under this section. The Secretary is encouraged to identify and utilize funding sources to supplement any Federal funding used for these facilities.
