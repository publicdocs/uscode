## § 410eee. Findings and purposes

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress finds that—

        (1) in 1946, Secretary of the Interior J.A. Krug, by means of the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior under [section 1866(a) of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1866/a] and [section 320102 of title 54][/us/usc/t54/s320102], established the Adams Mansion National Historic Site, located in Quincy, Massachusetts;

        (2) in 1952, Acting Secretary of the Interior Vernon D. Northrup enlarged the site and renamed it the Adams National Historic Site, using the Secretary’s authority as provided in the Historic Sites Act;  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (3) in 1972, Congress, through [Public Law 92–272][/us/pl/92/272], authorized the Secretary of the Interior to add approximately 3.68 acres at Adams National Historic Site;

        (4) in 1978, Congress, through [Public Law 95–625][/us/pl/95/625], authorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept by conveyance the birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, both in Quincy, Massachusetts, to be managed as part of the Adams National Historic Site;

        (5) in 1980, Congress, through [Public Law 96–435][/us/pl/96/435], authorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept the conveyance of the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, the burial place of John Adams, Abigail Adams, and John Quincy Adams and his wife, to be administered as part of the Adams National Historic Site;

        (6) the actions taken by past Secretaries of the Interior and past Congresses to preserve for the benefit, education and inspiration of present and future generations of Americans the home, property, birthplaces and burial site of John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Abigail Adams, have resulted in a multi-site unit of the National Park System with no overarching enabling or authorizing legislation; and

        (7) that  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. The word “that” probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  the sites and resources associated with John Adams, second President of the United States, his wife Abigail Adams, and John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States, require recognition as a national historical park in the National Park System.

    (b) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this subchapter is to establish the Adams National Historical Park in the City of Quincy, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to preserve, maintain and interpret the home, property, birthplaces, and burial site of John Adams and his wife Abigail, John Quincy Adams, and subsequent generations of the Adams family associated with the Adams property in Quincy, Massachusetts, for the benefit, education and inspiration of present and future generations of Americans.
