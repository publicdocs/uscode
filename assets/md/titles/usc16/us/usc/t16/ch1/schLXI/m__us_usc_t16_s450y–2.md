    The Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by him, which regulations shall be substantially similar to those now in effect, shall permit—

    Grazing of livestock within the memorial area to the extent now permitted within the said area when such grazing will not interfere with recreational development authorized by sections 450y to 450y–4 of this title.
