## § 460qq. Establishment

    (a) __Designation of area; revision of boundaries__ 

        In furtherance of the findings and purposes of this subchapter, certain lands in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, which comprise approximately twenty-three thousand one hundred acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled “Allegheny National Recreation Area—Proposed”, dated March 1984, are hereby designated as the Allegheny National Recreation Area (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “national recreation area”). The Secretary of Agriculture may revise the boundaries of the national recreation area to correct errors or to include additional lands acquired adjacent to the area.

    (b) __Description of purposes__ 

    The national recreation area shall be managed for the purposes of—

        (1) outdoor recreation including, but not limited to, hunting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, camping, nature study, and the use of motorized and nonmotorized boats on the Allegheny Reservoir;

        (2) the conservation of fish and wildlife populations and habitat;

        (3) the protection of watersheds and the maintenance of free flowing streams and the quality of ground and surface waters in accordance with applicable law;

        (4) the conservation of scenic, cultural, and other natural values of the area;

        (5) allowing the development of privately owned oil, gas, and mineral resources subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (c) of this section for the protection of the area; and

        (6) minimizing, to the extent practicable, environmental disturbances caused by resource development, consistent with the exercise of private property rights.

    (c) __Administration; plan of operations__ 

        The Secretary shall administer the national recreation area in accordance with the purposes described in subsection (b) of this section and the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the National Forest System. Subject to valid existing rights, any activity associated with the exploration, development, or transportation of oil, gas, or other minerals shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and in accordance with the management plan described in subsection (d) of this section, to achieve the purposes, described in subsection (b) of this section, of the national recreation area. For any such activity, the Secretary shall require a plan of operations which shall include provisions for adequate reclamation, including, to the extent practicable, revegetation and rehabilitation after each phase of operations is completed.

    (d) __Management plan__ 

        The Secretary shall prepare, and may from time to time amend, a management plan for the national recreation area. The plan may be prepared in conjunction with, or incorporated with, ongoing planning for the Allegheny National Forest in accordance with the National Forest Management Act of 1976. The initial management plan and significant amendments or revisions shall be accompanied by an environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \[[42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.\].

    (e) __Hunting, fishing, and trapping__ 

        The Secretary shall permit hunting, fishing, and trapping within the boundaries of the national recreation area in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws except that the Secretary may designate zones where, and establish periods when, no hunting, fishing, or trapping shall be permitted for reasons of public safety, administration, or public use and enjoyment. Except in emergencies, any prohibitions or restrictions made pursuant to this subsection shall be put into effect only after consultation with the appropriate State fish and game department.

    (f) __Withdrawal of minerals from appropriation and disposition__ 

        Subject to valid existing rights, the minerals in all federally owned lands within the national recreation area designated by this subchapter are withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing, including all laws pertaining to geothermal leasing, and all amendments thereto.

    (g) __Other National Forest management areas unaffected__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to or have any effect on any other management area of the National Forest System, including any wilderness area or any other national recreation area.
