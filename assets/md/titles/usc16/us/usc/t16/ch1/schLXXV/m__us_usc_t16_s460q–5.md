    The lands within the recreation area, subject to valid existing rights, are hereby withdrawn from location, entry, and patent under the United States mining laws. The Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as he deems appropriate, may permit the removal of the nonleasable minerals from lands or interests in lands under his jurisdiction within the recreation area in the manner prescribed by [section 387 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s387], and from those under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture within the recreation area in accordance with the provisions of [section 192c of title 30][/us/usc/t30/s192c], and he may permit the removal of leasable minerals from lands or interests in lands within the recreation area in accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended \[[30 U.S.C. 181][/us/usc/t30/s181] et seq.\], or the Acquired Lands Mineral Leasing Act of August 7, 1947 \[[30 U.S.C. 351][/us/usc/t30/s351] et seq.\], if he finds that such disposition would not have significant adverse effects on the purposes of the Central Valley project or the administration of the recreation area: Provided, That any lease or permit respecting such minerals in lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be issued only with his consent and subject to such conditions as he may prescribe.

    All receipts derived from permits and leases issued under the authority of this section on lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be paid into the same funds or accounts in the Treasury of the United States and shall be distributed in the same manner as provided for other receipts from the lands affected by the lease or permit, except that any receipts derived from permits or leases issued on those or other lands in the recreation area under the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended, or the Act of August 7, 1947, shall be disposed of as provided in the applicable Act; and receipts from the disposition of nonleasable minerals from public lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior shall be disposed of in the same manner as moneys received from the sale of public lands.
