## § 460l–6d. Commercial filming

    (a) __Commercial filming fee__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter individually referred to as the “Secretary” with respect to land (except land in a System unit as defined in [section 100102 of title 54][/us/usc/t54/s100102]) under their respective jurisdictions) shall require a permit and shall establish a reasonable fee for commercial filming activities or similar projects on Federal land administered by the Secretary. The fee shall provide a fair return to the United States and shall be based on the following criteria:

            (A) The number of days the filming activity or similar project takes place on Federal land under the Secretary’s jurisdiction.

            (B) The size of the film crew present on Federal land under the Secretary’s jurisdiction.

            (C) The amount and type of equipment present.

        (2) __Other factors__ 

            The Secretary may include other factors in determining an appropriate fee as the Secretary considers necessary.

    (b) __Recovery of costs__

        (1) there is a likelihood of resource damage;

        (2) there would be an unreasonable disruption of the public’s use and enjoyment of the site; or

        (3) the activity poses health or safety risks to the public.

    (e) __Use of proceeds__ 

        (1) __Fees__ 

            All fees collected under this section shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation and shall remain available until expended.

        (2) __Costs__ 

            All costs recovered under this section shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, at the site where the costs are collected and shall remain available until expended.

    (f) __Processing of permit applications__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a process to ensure that the Secretary responds in a timely manner to permit applicants for commercial filming, still photography, or other activity.
