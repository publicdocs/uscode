## § 47–1. Administrative site for Yosemite National Park

    (a) __Establishment of site__ 

        To enable the Secretary of the Interior to preserve the extraordinary natural qualities of Yosemite National Park, notwithstanding its increasing use by the public, the Secretary is hereby authorized to provide in the manner hereinafter set forth an administrative site in the El Portal area adjacent to Yosemite National Park, in order that utilities, facilities, and services required in the operation and administration of Yosemite National Park may be located on such site outside the park.

    (b) __Acquisition of land__ 

        For said site the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire by purchase or donation, or with donated funds, approximately twelve hundred acres, as shown on map numbered NP–YOS–7011, of non-Federal land, interests in land, and appurtenances thereto, and, to avoid severing parcels in private ownership which extend beyond the area so depicted, the Secretary of the Interior may acquire in their entirety such parcels of land or interests therein.

    (c) __Transfers of jurisdiction__ 

        The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior are authorized to arrange and effect mutually satisfactory transfers of jurisdiction over land administered by each in the El Portal area.

    (d) __Pre-existing claim, location, or entry__ 

        Nothing herein contained shall affect any valid claim, location, or entry existing under the land laws of the United States, or the rights of any such claimant, locator, or entryman to the full use and enjoyment of his land.

    (e) __Status of acquired land__ 

        Until further action by the Congress, the lands acquired by or transferred to the Secretary of the Interior hereunder shall not become a part of Yosemite National Park, nor be subject to the laws and regulations governing said park, but the Secretary of the Interior shall have supervision, management, and control of the area and shall make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary and proper for its use and management: Provided, That he may grant nonexclusive privileges, leases, and permits for the use of land in the area and enter into contracts relating to the same, subject to the limitations and conditions applying to the similar authority provided in [section 3 of the Act of August 25, 1916][/us/act/1916-08-25/s3] ([39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535]), as amended ([45 Stat. 235][/us/stat/45/235], 16 U.S.C., 1952 edition, sec. 3). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>
