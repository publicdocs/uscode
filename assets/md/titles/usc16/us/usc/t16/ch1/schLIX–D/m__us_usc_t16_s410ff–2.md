        (1) an inventory of all terrestrial and marine species, indicating their population dynamics, and probable trends as to future numbers and welfare;

        (2) recommendations as to what actions should be considered for adoption to better protect the natural resources of the park.

        Such report shall be submitted within two complete fiscal years from March 5, 1980, to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate, and updated revisions of such report shall be similarly submitted at subsequent two year intervals to cover a period of ten years after March 5, 1980.

No provision of this subchapter shall be deemed to affect the rights and jurisdiction of the State of California within the park, including, but not limited to, authority over submerged lands and waters within the park boundaries, and the marine resources therein.
