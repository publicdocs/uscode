## § 460kk. Establishment

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds that—

        (1) there are significant scenic, recreational, educational, scientific, natural, archeological, and public health benefits provided by the Santa Monica Mountains and adjacent coastline area;

        (2) there is a national interest in protecting and preserving these benefits for the residents of and visitors to the area; and

        (3) the State of California and its local units of government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses of the Santa Monica Mountains and adjacent coastline area and can, to a great extent, protect the health, safety, and general welfare by the use of such authority.

    (b) __Establishment; management__ 

        There is hereby established the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (hereinafter referred to as the “recreation area”). The Secretary shall manage the recreation area in a manner which will preserve and enhance its scenic, natural, and historical setting and its public health value as an airshed for the Southern California metropolitan area while providing for the recreational and educational need of the visiting public.

    (c) __Description; boundary revisions: notice to Congressional committees, publication in Federal Register; acquisition of property: manner, transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary, exchange of lands with city of Los Angeles, development of municipal cultural resource management program; Nike Site transfer to Secretary__ 

        (1) The recreation area shall consist of the lands and waters and interests generally depicted as the recreation area on the map entitled “Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Santa Monica Mountains Zone, California, Boundary Map”, numbered 80,047–C and dated August 2001, which shall be on file and available for inspection in the offices of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, and in the offices of the General Services Administration in the Federal Office Building in West Los Angeles, California, and in the main public library in Ventura, California. After advising the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate, in writing, the Secretary may make minor revisions of the boundaries of the recreation area when necessary by publication of a revised drawing or other boundary description in the Federal Register.

        (2)

            (A) Not later than ninety days after November 10, 1978, the Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of the State of California, the California Coastal Commission, and the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission, shall commence acquisition of lands, improvements, waters, or interests therein within the recreation area. Such acquisition may be by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer from any Federal agency, exchange, or otherwise. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any lands or interests therein owned by the State of California or any political subdivision thereof (including any park district or other public entity) may be acquired only by donation, except that such lands acquired after November 10, 1978, by the State of California or its political subdivisions may be acquired by purchase or exchange if the Secretary determines that the lands were acquired for purposes which further the national interest in protecting the area and that the purchase price or value on exchange does not exceed fair market value on the date that the State acquired the land or interest: Provided, however, That the value of any lands acquired by the Secretary under the exception in this sentence shall be deducted from the amount of moneys available for grants to the State under subsection (n) of this section. Lands within the “Wildlife Corridor Expansion Zone” identified on the boundary map referred to in paragraph (1) may be acquired only by donation or with donated funds. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within the boundaries of the recreation area shall, with the concurrence of the head of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without cost, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of the recreation area.

            (B) The Secretary shall negotiate, and carry out, and exchange with the city of Los Angeles (acting through its department of water and power) certain federally owned lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir in Inyo County for certain lands owned by the city of Los Angeles which are associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir in the city of Los Angeles. Lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to such exchange shall be transferred without cost to the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service for inclusion within the recreation area. The Secretary shall include in such exchange a provision for an easement to be granted to the city of Los Angeles for the existing water pipeline associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir and for the city of Los Angeles to provide for replacement water to maintain the water elevations of the Franklin Reservoir to the current levels. The values of lands exchanged under this provision shall be equal, or shall be equalized, in the same manner as provided in [section 1716 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1716].

            (C) The city shall assume full responsibility for the protection of cultural resources and shall develop a cultural resource management program for the public lands to be transferred to the city in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir. The program shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the California State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

        (3) The Administrator of the General Services Administration is hereby authorized and directed to transfer the site generally known as Nike Site 78 to the Secretary for inclusion in the recreation area: Provided, That the county of Los Angeles shall be permitted to continue to use without charge the facilities together with sufficient land as in the determination of the Secretary shall be necessary to continue to maintain and operate a fire suppression and training facility and shall be excused from payment for any use of the land and facilities on the site prior to November 10, 1978. At such time as the county of Los Angeles, California, relinquishes control of such facilities and adjacent land or ceases the operation of the fire suppression and training facility, the land and facilities shall be managed by the Secretary as a part of the recreation area.

    (d) __Identification and revision of areas: public ownership for critical purposes; land and area plan: submission to Congressional committees__ 

        (1) Within six months after November 10, 1978, the Secretary shall identify the lands, waters, and interests within the recreation area which must be acquired and held in public ownership for the following critical purposes: preservation of beaches and coastal uplands; protection of undeveloped inland stream drainage basins; connection of existing State and local government parks and other publicly owned lands to enhance their potential for public recreation use; protection of existing park roads and scenic corridors, including such right-of-way as is necessary for the protection of the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Corridor; protection of the public health and welfare; and development and interpretation of historic sites and recreation areas in connection therewith, to include, but not be limited to, parks, picnic areas, scenic overlooks, hiking trails, bicycle trails, and equestrian trails. The Secretary may from time to time revise the identification of such areas, and any such revisions shall become effective in the same manner as herein provided for revisions in the boundaries of the recreation area.

        (2)

         By January 1, 1980, the Secretary shall submit, in writing, to the committees referred to in subsection (c) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the United States Congress a detailed plan which shall indicate—

            (A) the lands and areas identified in paragraph (1),

            (B) the lands which he has previously acquired by purchase, donation, exchange, or transfer for the purpose of this recreation area,

            (C) the annual acquisition program (including the level of funding) recommended for the ensuing five fiscal years, and

            (D) the final boundary map for the recreation area.

    (e) __Improved property and scenic easement acquisitions__ 

        With respect to improved properties, as defined in this section, fee title shall not be acquired unless the Secretary finds that such lands are being used, or are threatened with uses, which are detrimental to the purposes of the recreation area, or unless each acquisition is necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. The Secretary may acquire scenic easements to such improved property or such other interests as, in his judgment are necessary for the purposes of the recreation area.

    (f) __“Improved property” defined__ 

    For the purposes of this section, the term “improved property” means—

        (1) a detached single-family dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1978 (hereafter referred to as “dwelling”), together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated as is in the same ownership as the dwelling and as the Secretary designates to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures necessary to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated, and

        (2) property developed for agricultural uses, together with any structures accessory thereto as were used for agricultural purposes on or before January 1, 1978.

        In determining when and to what extent a property is to be treated as “improved property” for purposes of this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1978, and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed prior to such date.

    (g) __Owner’s reservation of right of use and occupancy for fixed term of years or life; election of term; fair market value; termination; notification__ 

        The owner of an improved property, as defined in this section, on the date of its acquisition, as a condition of such acquisition, may retain for herself or himself, her or his heirs and assigns, a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for noncommercial residential or agriculture purposes, as the case may be, for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or, in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner or the death of her or his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Unless the property is wholly or partially donated, the Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of its acquisition, less the fair market value on that date of the right retained by the owner. A right retained by the owner pursuant to this section shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that it is being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this section, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.

    (h) __Hardship sale offers__ 

        In exercising the authority to acquire property under this section, the Secretary shall give prompt and careful consideration to any offer made by an individual owning property within the recreation area to sell such property, if such individual notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship.

    (i) __Administration__ 

        The Secretary shall administer the recreation area in accordance with this Act and provisions of laws generally applicable to units of the National Park System, including the Act of August 25, 1916 ([39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535]; [16 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t16/s1] et seq.). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  In the administration of the recreation area, the Secretary may utilize such statutory authority available for the conservation and management of wildlife and natural resources as appropriate to carry out the purpose of this section. The fragile resource areas of the recreation area shall be administered on a low-intensity basis, as determined by the Secretary.

    (j) __Cooperative agreements for rescue, fire prevention and firefighting, and law enforcement services__ 

        The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with the State of California, or any political subdivision thereof, for the rendering, on a reimbursable basis, of rescue, firefighting, and law enforcement services and cooperative assistance by nearby law enforcement and fire preventive agencies.

    (k) __Donations__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized to accept donations of funds, property, or services from individuals, foundations, corporations, or public entities for the purpose of land acquisition and providing services and facilities which the Secretary deems consistent with the purposes of this section.

    (l) __Report of Advisory Commission to Secretary__ 

    By January 1, 1981, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Commission, established by this section, shall submit a report to the Secretary which shall—

        (1) assess the capability and willingness of the State of California and the local units of government to manage and operate the recreation area,

        (2) recommend any changes in ownership, management, and operation which would better accomplish the purposes of this section, and

        (3) recommend any conditions, joint management agreements, or other land use mechanisms to be contingent on any transfer of land.

    (m) __Report of Secretary to Congressional committees__ 

    The Secretary, after giving careful consideration to the recommendations set forth by the Advisory Commission, shall, by January 1, 1982, submit a report to the committees referred to in subsection (c) which shall incorporate the recommendations of the Advisory Commission as well as set forth the Secretary’s recommendations. Such report shall—

        (1) assess the benefits and costs of continued management as a unit of the National Park System,

        (2) assess the capability and willingness of the State of California and the local units of government to manage and operate the recreation area, and

        (3) recommend any changes in ownership, management, and operation which would better accomplish the purposes of this section.

    (n) __Comprehensive plan; contents; approval considerations; environmental consultations; grants and funds; assurance and grant requirements; plan changes: liability for reimbursement of funds, approval by Secretary__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall request the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission to submit a comprehensive plan, prepared in accord with this section and title 7.75 of the California Government Code (commencing with section 67450), for the Santa Monica Mountains Zone generally depicted on the map referred to in subsection (c) of this section for approval.

        (2)

         The comprehensive plan shall include, in addition to the requirements of California State law—

            (A) an identification and designation of public and private uses which are compatible with and which would not significantly impair the significant scenic, recreational, educational, scientific, natural, archeological, and public health benefits present in the zone and which would not have an adverse impact on the recreation area or on the air quality of the south coast air basin;

            (B) a specific minimum land acquisition program which shall include, but not be limited to, fee and less than fee acquisition of strategic and critical sites not to be acquired by the Federal Government for public recreational and other related uses; and a program for the complementary use of State and local authority to regulate the use of lands and waters within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone to the fullest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this section; and

            (C) a recreation transportation system which may include but need not be limited to existing public transit.

        (3)

         No plan submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be approved unless the Secretary finds the plan consistent with paragraph (2) and finds that—

            (A) the planning commission has afforded adequate opportunity, including public hearings, for public involvement in the preparation and review of the plan, and public comments were received and considered in the plan or revision as presented to him;

            (B) the State and local units of government identified in the plan as responsible for implementing its provisions have the necessary authority to implement the plan and such State and local units of government have indicated their intention to use such authority to implement the plan;

            (C) the plan, if implemented, would preserve significant natural, historical, and archeological benefits and, consistent with such benefits, provide increased recreational opportunities for persons residing in the greater Los Angeles-southern California metropolitan area; and

            (D) implementation of the plan would not have a serious adverse impact on the air quality or public health of the greater Los Angeles region.

            Before making his findings on the air quality and public health impacts of the plan, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

        (4)

         Following approval of the plan with respect to the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, upon receipt of adequate assurances that all aspects of that jurisdiction’s implementation responsibilities will be adopted and put into effect, the Secretary shall—

            (A) provide grants to the State and through the State to local governmental bodies for acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein identified in paragraph (2)(B), and for development of essential public facilities, except that such grants shall be made only for the acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein, and related essential public facilities, for park, recreation, and conservation purposes; and

            (B) provide, subject to agreements that in the opinion of the Secretary will assure additional preservation of the lands and waters of the zone, such funds as may be necessary to retire bonded indebtedness for water and sewer and other utilities already incurred by property owners which in the opinion of the Secretary would if left outstanding contribute to further development of the zone in a manner inconsistent with the approved plan developed by the planning commission.

            No grant for acquisition of land may be made under subparagraph (A) unless the Secretary receives satisfactory assurances that such lands acquired under subparagraph (A) shall not be converted to other than park, recreation, and conservation purposes without the approval of the Secretary and without provision for suitable replacement land.

        (5) Grants under this section shall be made only upon application of the recipient State and shall be in addition to any other Federal financial assistance for any other program, and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Any jurisdiction that implements changes to the approved plan which are inconsistent with the purposes of this section, or adopts or acquiesces in changes to laws, regulations or policies necessary to implement or protect the approved plan, without approval of the Secretary, may be liable for reimbursement of all funds previously granted or available to it under the terms of this section without regard to such additional terms and conditions or other requirements of law that may be applicable to such grants. During the life of the planning commission, changes to the plan must be submitted by the planning commission to the Secretary for approval. No such application for a grant may be made after the date five years from the date of the Secretary’s approval of the plan.

    (o) __Comments on undertakings prior to expenditure of Federal funds or issuance of licenses or permits__ 

        The head of any Federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in the lands and waters within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, generally depicted on the map referred to in subsection (c), and the head of any Federal agency having authority to license or permit any undertaking in such lands and waters shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on such undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license or permit, as the case may be, afford the Secretary a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking and shall give due consideration to any comments made by the Secretary and to the effect of such undertaking on the “findings” and purposes of this section.
