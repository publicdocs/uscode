([Pub. L. 91–660][/us/pl/91/660], § 1, Jan. 8, 1971, [84 Stat. 1967][/us/stat/84/1967]; [Pub. L. 106–554][/us/pl/106/554], § 1(a)(4) \[div. B, title I, § 137(a)\], Dec. 21, 2000, [114 Stat. 2763][/us/stat/114/2763], 2763A–231.)

 __References in Text__ 

    Sections 459h to 459h–10 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(3), was in the original “this title”, and was translated as reading “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 91–660][/us/pl/91/660], which enacted sections 459h to 459h–10 of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 91–660][/us/pl/91/660] does not contain titles.

 __Amendments__ 

    2000—[Pub. L. 106–554][/us/pl/106/554] inserted section catchline and subsec. (a) designation and heading, substituted “In order” for “That, in order”, inserted subsec.
