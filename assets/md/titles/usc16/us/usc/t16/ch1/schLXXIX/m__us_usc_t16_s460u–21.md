    (f) __Alternative improvement plans; cost estimates; sources of funding__ 

        The study shall present alternative plans to improve, construct, and extend access roads, public transportation, and bicycle and pedestrian trails. It shall include cost estimates of all plans considered in this study, and shall discuss existing and proposed sources of funding for the implementation of the recommended plan alternatives.
