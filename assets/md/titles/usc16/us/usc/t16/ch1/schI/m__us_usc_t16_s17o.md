## § 17o. National Park Service housing improvement

    (1) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this section are—

        (A) to develop where necessary an adequate supply of quality housing units for field employees of the National Park Service within a reasonable time frame;

        (B) to expand the alternatives available for construction and repair of essential Government housing;

        (C) to rely on the private sector to finance or supply housing in carrying out this section, to the maximum extent possible, in order to reduce the need for Federal appropriations;

        (D) to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide for long-term maintenance needs of field employee housing; and

        (E) to eliminate unnecessary Government housing and locate such housing as is required in a manner such that primary resource values are not impaired.

    (2) __General authority__ 

        To enhance the ability of the Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in this section referred to as “the Secretary”), acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to effectively manage units of the National Park System, the Secretary is authorized where necessary and justified to make available employee housing, on or off the lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service, and to rent or lease such housing to field employees of the National Park Service at rates based on the reasonable value of the housing in accordance with requirements applicable under [section 5911 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5911].

    (3) __Review and revision of housing criteria__ 

        On November 12, 1996, the Secretary shall review and revise the existing criteria under which housing is provided to employees of the National Park Service.

    (4) __Submission of report__ 

        A report detailing the results of the revisions required by paragraph (3) shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 180 days after November 12, 1996.

The review shall include an assessment of the physical condition of such housing and the suitability of such housing to effectively carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. For each unit of such housing, the Secretary shall determine whether the unit is needed and justified. The review shall include estimates of the cost of bringing each unit that is needed and justified into usable condition that meets all applicable legal housing requirements or, if the unit is determined to be obsolete but is still warranted to carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service, the cost of replacing the unit.

    (6) __Authorization for housing agreements__ 

        For those units of the National Park System for which the review required by paragraphs (3) and (5) has been completed, the Secretary is authorized, pursuant to the authorities contained in this section and subject to the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, to enter into housing agreements with housing entities under which such housing entities may develop, construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing, located on or off public lands, for rent or lease to National Park Service employees who meet the housing eligibility criteria developed by the Secretary pursuant to this section.

            (iv) may be granted at less than fair market value if the Secretary determines that such lease will improve the quality and availability of field employee quarters available.

        (D) __Contributions by United States__

            (i) the requirement for such seasonal field employee quarters is temporary; or

            (ii) leasing would be more cost-effective than construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.
