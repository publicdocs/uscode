        (1) the amount of land acquired during the current fiscal year and the amount expended therefor;

        (2) the amount of land remaining to be acquired; and

        (3) the amount of land programed for acquisition in the ensuing fiscal year and the estimated cost thereof.

    (b) __Development of essential public facilities__ 

        For the development of essential public facilities there are authorized to be appropriated $2.6 million in addition to the sums previously appropriated.
