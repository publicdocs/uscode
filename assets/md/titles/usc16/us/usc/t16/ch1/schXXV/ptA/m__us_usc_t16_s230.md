    2009—[Pub. L. 111–11, § 7105(f)(2)(B)][/us/pl/111/11/s7105/f/2/B], which directed amendment of title IX of [Pub. L. 95–625][/us/pl/95/625] by substituting “Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve” for “Jean Lafitte National Historical Park” each place it appears, was not executed to first sentence or cl. (1) of second sentence of this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because “Jean Lafitte National Historical Park” already appeared in those places preceding “and Preserve”.

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–250][/us/pl/100/250] added cl. (4) and redesignated former cls. (4) and (5) as (5) and (6), respectively.
