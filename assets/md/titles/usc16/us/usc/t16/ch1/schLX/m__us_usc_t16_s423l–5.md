    (c) __Cooperative agreements__ 

        The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia, its political subdivisions (including the City of Richmond), private property owners, and other members of the private sector to develop mechanisms to protect and interpret the historical resources within the battlefield park in a manner that would allow for continued private ownership and use where compatible with the purposes for which the battlefield is established.

        The Secretary may provide technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Virginia, its political subdivisions, nonprofit entities, and private property owners for the development of comprehensive plans, land use guidelines, special studies, and other activities that are consistent with the identification, protection, interpretation, and commemoration of historically significant Civil War resources located inside and outside of the boundaries of the battlefield park.
