    (a) __Offer__ 

    In the case of each individual who—

        (1) sold residential property between 1966 and 1968 to the United States for purposes of the park, and

        (2) continues to occupy such residential property pursuant to a residential special use permit as of October 24, 1992,

        the Secretary of the Interior shall offer to extend such residential special use permit for a term ending on the death of such individual or such individual’s spouse, whichever is later.

    (b) __Terms and conditions__ 

    Any residential special use permit extended pursuant to subsection (a) shall—

        (1) permit the reasonable residential use and occupancy of the property by the individual to whom such permit is granted and such individual’s spouse; and

        (2) be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe (including termination) to ensure that the permit does not unreasonably diminish the values of the park.
