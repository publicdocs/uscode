        With respect to areas within the 1954 boundaries of the park, as identified on the map referred to in [section 429b of this title][/us/usc/t16/s429b], the Secretary may not acquire fee simple title to such areas without the consent of the owner so long as the lands continue to be devoted to a use which is the same as that in effect on September 1, 1980. Further, if the Secretary proposes to acquire fee simple title to such property because of a change in use, the owner of such property may seek a review of the proposed acquisition of his or her property and is entitled to a hearing on the record in accordance with [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554].
