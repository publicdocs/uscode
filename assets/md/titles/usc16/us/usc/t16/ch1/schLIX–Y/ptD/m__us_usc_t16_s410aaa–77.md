## § 410aaa–77. California State School lands

    (a) __Negotiations to exchange__ 

        Upon request of the California State Lands Commission (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Commission”), the Secretary shall enter into negotiations for an agreement to exchange Federal lands or interests therein on the list referred to in subsection (b)(2) for California State School lands or interests therein which are located within the boundaries of one or more of the wilderness areas or park system units designated by this Act (hereinafter in this section referred to as “State School lands.”). The Secretary shall negotiate in good faith to reach a land exchange agreement consistent with the requirements of section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \[[43 U.S.C. 1716][/us/usc/t43/s1716]\].

    (b) __Preparation of list__ 

    Within six months after October 31, 1994, the Secretary shall send to the Commission and to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives a list of the following:

        (1) State School lands or interests therein (including mineral interests) which are located within the boundaries of the wilderness areas or park system units designated by this Act.

        (2)

         Lands within the State of California under the jurisdiction of the Secretary that the Secretary determines to be suitable for disposal for exchange, identified in the following priority—

            (A) lands with mineral interests, including geothermal, which have the potential for commercial development but which are not currently under mineral lease or producing Federal mineral revenues;

            (B) Federal claims in California managed by the Bureau of Reclamation that the Secretary determines are not needed for any Bureau of Reclamation project; and

            (C) any public lands in California that the Secretary, pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \[[43 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t43/s1701] et seq.\], has determined to be suitable for disposal through exchange.

        (3) Any other Federal land, or interest therein, within the State of California, which is or becomes surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. The Secretary may exclude, in the Secretary’s discretion, lands located within, or contiguous to, the exterior boundaries of lands held in trust for a federally recognized Indian tribe located in the State of California.

        (4) The Secretary shall maintain such list and shall annually transmit such list to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives until all of the State School lands identified in paragraph (1) have been acquired.

    (c) __Disposal of surplus Federal property__ 

        (1)

         Effective upon October 31, 1994, and until all State School lands identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are acquired, no Federal lands or interests therein within the State of California may be disposed of from Federal ownership unless—

            (A) the Secretary is notified of the availability of such lands or interest therein;

            (B) the Secretary has notified the Commission of the availability of such lands or interests therein for exchange; and

            (C) the Commission has not notified the Secretary within six months that it wishes to consider entering into an exchange for such lands or interests therein.

        (2) If the Commission notifies the Secretary that it wishes to consider an exchange for such lands or interests therein, the Secretary shall attempt to conclude such exchange in accordance with the provisions of this section as quickly as possible.

        (3) If an agreement is reached and executed with the Commission, then upon notice to the head of the agency having administrative jurisdiction over such lands or interests therein, the Secretary shall be vested with administrative jurisdiction over such land or interests therein for the purpose of concluding such exchange.

        (4) Upon the acquisition of all State School lands or upon notice by the Commission to the Secretary that it no longer has an interest in such lands or interests therein, such lands or interests shall be released to the agency that originally had jurisdiction over such lands or interests for disposal in accordance with the laws otherwise applicable to such lands or interests.

    (d) __No effect on military base closures__ 

        The provisions of this section shall not apply to the disposal of property under title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act ([Public Law 100–526][/us/pl/100/526]; [102 Stat. 2627][/us/stat/102/2627]; [10 U.S.C. 2687][/us/usc/t10/s2687] note) or the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 ([Public Law 101–510][/us/pl/101/510]; [104 Stat. 1808][/us/stat/104/1808]; [10 U.S.C. 2687][/us/usc/t10/s2687] note).
