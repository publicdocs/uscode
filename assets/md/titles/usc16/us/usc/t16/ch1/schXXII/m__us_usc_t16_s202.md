## § 202. Control; rules and regulations; fish and game; leases; automobiles; stock grazing

    Lassen Volcanic National Park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior. He shall make such rules and regulations and exercise such powers as are enumerated in [section 3 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3] insofar as not inconsistent with this section. Such regulations shall be aimed primarily at the freest use of the said park for recreation purposes by the public and for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, and natural curiosities or wonders within said park and their retention in their natural condition as far as practicable and for the preservation of the park in a state of nature so far as is consistent with the purposes of this section and sections 201 and 203 of this title. He shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for purposes of merchandise or profit, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary to fully carry out the objects and purposes of said sections. He may, in his discretion, execute leases to parcels of ground not exceeding 10 acres in extent at any one place to any one person or persons or company for not to exceed 20 years when such ground is necessary for the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors and to parcels of ground not exceeding one acre in extent and for not to exceed 20 years to persons who have heretofore erected, or whom he may hereafter authorize to erect, summer homes or cottages. Such leases or privileges may be renewed or extended at the expiration of the terms thereof. No exclusive privilege, however, shall be granted within the park except upon the ground leased. The regulations governing the park shall include provisions for the use of automobiles therein and the reasonable grazing of stock.

([Aug. 9, 1916, ch. 302, § 2][/us/act/1916-08-09/ch302/s2], [39 Stat. 444][/us/stat/39/444].)

 __Codification__ 

    A provision for the making of necessary rules and regulations by the Secretary of the Interior has been omitted by reason of the reference to [section 3 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3], derived from [act Aug. 25, 1916, ch. 408, § 3][/us/act/1916-08-25/ch408/s3], [39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535], authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to make and publish rules and regulations applicable to National Parks.
