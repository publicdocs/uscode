## § 423l–4. Land acquisition

    (a) __Acquisition authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary may acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands within the boundaries of the battlefield park from willing landowners by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. In acquiring lands and interests in lands under sections 423l–1 to 423l–6 of this title, the Secretary shall acquire the minimum interest necessary to achieve the purposes for which the battlefield is established.

        (2) __Special rule for private lands__ 

            Privately owned lands or interests in lands may be acquired under sections 423l–1 to 423l–6 of this title only with the consent of the owner.

    (b) __Easements__ 

        (1) __Outside boundaries__ 

            The Secretary may acquire an easement on property outside the boundaries of the battlefield park and around the City of Richmond, with the consent of the owner, if the Secretary determines that the easement is necessary to protect core Civil War resources as identified by the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee. Upon acquisition of the easement, the Secretary shall revise the boundaries of the battlefield park to include the property subject to the easement.

        (2) __Inside boundaries__ 

            To the extent practicable, and if preferred by a willing landowner, the Secretary shall use permanent conservation easements to acquire interests in land in lieu of acquiring land in fee simple and thereby removing land from non-Federal ownership.

    (c) __Visitor center__ 

        The Secretary may acquire the Tredegar Iron Works buildings and associated land in the City of Richmond for use as a visitor center for the battlefield park.
