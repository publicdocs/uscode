        (3)

         the Secretary has determined—

            (A) that except insofar as otherwise provided in this section, the exchange is not inconsistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \[[43 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t43/s1701] et seq.\]; and

            (B) that the exchange is in the public interest.

        The private mineral interests to be exchanged pursuant to this section underlie the lands, comprising approximately 15,141 acres, depicted as “Proposed for transfer to U.S.” on the map referenced in subsection (d) of this section.
