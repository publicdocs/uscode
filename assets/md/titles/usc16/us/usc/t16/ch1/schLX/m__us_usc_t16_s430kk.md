    (d) __Liability__ 

        The revision of the boundaries of the Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield by subsection (b) of this section shall not be considered to create any liability for, or to have any effect on any liability under any other law of, any owner of private property with respect to any person injured on that private property.

    (e) __Recognition of authority to control land use__
