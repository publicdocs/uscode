Upon the basis of such appraisals, the Secretary is authorized to convey such property for public-school purposes to the State of Pennsylvania, or the appropriate local agency thereof, the conveyance to be made in exchange for non-Federal land of approximately equal value, which land, upon acceptance by the United States, shall become a part of Gettysburg National Military Park.
