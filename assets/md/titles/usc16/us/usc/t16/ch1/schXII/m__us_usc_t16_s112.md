## § 112. Control; regulations; prehistoric ruins

    Mesa Verde National Park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior. In addition to the duties and powers enumerated in [section 3 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3] not inconsistent with this section, he shall establish such service as he may deem necessary for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide specifically for the preservation from injury or spoliation of the ruins and other works and relics of prehistoric or primitive man within said park.

([June 29, 1906, ch. 3607, § 2][/us/act/1906-06-29/ch3607/s2], [34 Stat. 617][/us/stat/34/617]; [June 30, 1913, ch. 4, § 1][/us/act/1913-06-30/ch4/s1], [38 Stat. 84][/us/stat/38/84].)

 __Codification__ 

    As enacted by act June 29, 1906, this section began with a clause naming the park which was stricken out and inserted as the last sentence of [section 111 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s111].

    A provision for the making of necessary rules and regulations by the Secretary of the Interior has been omitted by reason of the reference to [section 3 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s3], derived from [act Aug. 25, 1916, ch. 408, § 3][/us/act/1916-08-25/ch408/s3], [39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535], authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to make and publish rules and regulations applicable to National Parks.
