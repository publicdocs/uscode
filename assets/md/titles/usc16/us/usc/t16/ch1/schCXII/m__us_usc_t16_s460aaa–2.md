        (6) The Secretary shall provide through concession, permit, or other means docking and lodge facilities consistent with the management plan developed pursuant to [section 460aaa–6 of this title][/us/usc/t16/s460aaa–6].

        (7) The Secretary shall take reasonable actions to provide for public health and safety and for the protection of the national recreation area in the event of fire or infestation of insects or disease.

Any such permit shall be issued for an initial period of 20 years and shall be renewed thereafter for successive 20-year periods so long as the permittee is in compliance with the purposes of this subchapter, the terms of the permit, and other applicable rules and regulations. Any such permit shall be issued in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations of the Secretary pertaining to the National Forest System, except that such permit shall be subject to the following special provisions:

            (C) The Secretary shall collect fees on an annual basis based on the fair market value of the occupancy permitted.

            (F) The permit may be terminated at any time for failure to comply with its terms and conditions and applicable regulations without cost to the Federal Government in accordance with the permit.

            (G) After termination of any such permit, if any improvements or property are not removed by their owner within one year of the termination, they shall become the property of the Federal Government.

        (9) Solely for purposes of payments pursuant to [section 6904 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s6904], lands on Grand Island acquired by the United States after January 1, 1990 shall be considered to have been acquired for addition to a National Forest Wilderness Area (national forest portion of the National Wilderness Preservation System).
