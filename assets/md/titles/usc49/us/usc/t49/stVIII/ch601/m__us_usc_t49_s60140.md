        (1)  __Study__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study of hazardous liquid pipeline incidents at crossings of inland bodies of water with a width of at least 100 feet from high water mark to high water mark to determine if the depth of cover over the buried pipeline was a factor in any accidental release of hazardous liquids.

        (2)  __Report__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the study.

        (2) __Legislative recommendations.—__ 

            (A)  __Development__  __.—__ 

            If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that the current requirements for the depth of cover over buried pipelines are insufficient, the Secretary shall develop legislative recommendations for improving the safety of buried pipelines at crossings of inland bodies of water with a width of at least 100 feet from high water mark to high water mark.

            (B)  __Consideration of factors__  __.—__
