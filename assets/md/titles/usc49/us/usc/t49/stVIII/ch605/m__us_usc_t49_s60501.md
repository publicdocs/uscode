    The words “duties and powers . . . that were vested . . . in” are coextensive with, and substituted for, “transferred . . . such functions set forth in the Interstate Commerce Act and vested by law in” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “on October 1, 1977” are added to reflect the effective date of the transfer of the duties and powers to the Secretary of Energy.
