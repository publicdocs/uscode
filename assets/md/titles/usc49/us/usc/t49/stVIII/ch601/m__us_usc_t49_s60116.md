 __References in Text__ 

    The date of enactment of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, referred to in subsec. (b), is the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 107–355][/us/pl/107/355], which was approved Dec. 17, 2002.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—[Pub. L. 107–355][/us/pl/107/355] reenacted section catchline without change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “Under regulations the Secretary of Transportation prescribes, each owner or operator of a gas pipeline facility shall carry out a program to educate the public on the use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation, the possible hazards associated with gas leaks, and the importance of reporting gas odors and leaks to the appropriate authority. The Secretary may develop material suitable for use in the program.”

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–304][/us/pl/104/304] substituted “owner or operator of a gas pipeline facility” for “person transporting gas”, inserted “the use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation,” after “educate the public on”, and inserted comma after “gas leaks”.
