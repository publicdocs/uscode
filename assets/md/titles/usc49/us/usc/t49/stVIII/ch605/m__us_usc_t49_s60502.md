    The words “duties and powers . . . that were vested . . . in” are coextensive with, and substituted for, “transferred to, and vested in . . . all functions and authority of” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “regulatory” is omitted as surplus. The words “on October 1, 1977” are added to reflect the effective date of the transfer of the duties and powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
