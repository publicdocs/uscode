        (4) Participation by operators, excavators, and other stakeholders in the development and implementation of effective employee training programs to ensure that operators, the one-call center, the enforcing agency, and the excavators have partnered to design and implement training for the employees of operators, excavators, and locators.

        (5) A process for fostering and ensuring active participation by all stakeholders in public education for damage prevention activities.

        (6) A process for resolving disputes that defines the State authority’s role as a partner and facilitator to resolve issues.

        (8) A process for fostering and promoting the use, by all appropriate stakeholders, of improving technologies that may enhance communications, underground pipeline locating capability, and gathering and analyzing information about the accuracy and effectiveness of locating programs.

        (9) A process for review and analysis of the effectiveness of each program element, including a means for implementing improvements identified by such program reviews.

    (c)  __Factors to Consider__  __.—__
