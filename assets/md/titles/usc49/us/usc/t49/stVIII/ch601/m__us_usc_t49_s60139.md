## § 60139. Maximum allowable operating pressure

    (a) __Verification of Records.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary of Transportation shall require each owner or operator of a pipeline facility to conduct, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this section, a verification of the records of the owner or operator relating to the interstate and intrastate gas transmission pipelines of the owner or operator in class 3 and class 4 locations and class 1 and class 2 high-consequence areas.

        (2)  __Purpose__  __.—__ 

        The purpose of the verification shall be to ensure that the records accurately reflect the physical and operational characteristics of the pipelines described in paragraph (1) and confirm the established maximum allowable operating pressure of the pipelines.

        (3)  __Elements__  __.—__ 

        The verification process under this subsection shall include such elements as the Secretary considers appropriate.

    (b) __Reporting.—__ 

        (1)  __Documentation of certain pipelines__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, each owner or operator of a pipeline facility shall identify and submit to the Secretary documentation relating to each pipeline segment of the owner or operator described in subsection (a)(1) for which the records of the owner or operator are insufficient to confirm the established maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment.

        (2)  __Exceedances of maximum allowable operating pressure__  __.—__ 

        If there is an exceedance of the maximum allowable operating pressure with respect to a gas transmission pipeline of an owner or operator of a pipeline facility that exceeds the build-up allowed for operation of pressure-limiting or control devices, the owner or operator shall report the exceedance to the Secretary and appropriate State authorities on or before the 5th day following the date on which the exceedance occurs.

    (c) __Determination of Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        In the case of a transmission line of an owner or operator of a pipeline facility identified under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary shall—

            (A) require the owner or operator to reconfirm a maximum allowable operating pressure as expeditiously as economically feasible; and

            (B) determine what actions are appropriate for the pipeline owner or operator to take to maintain safety until a maximum allowable operating pressure is confirmed.

        (2)  __Interim actions__  __.—__ 

        In determining the actions for an owner or operator of a pipeline facility to take under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall take into account potential consequences to public safety and the environment, potential impacts on pipeline system reliability and deliverability, and other factors, as appropriate.

    (d) __Testing Regulations.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations for conducting tests to confirm the material strength of previously untested natural gas transmission pipelines located in high-consequence areas and operating at a pressure greater than 30 percent of specified minimum yield strength.

        (2)  __Considerations__  __.—__ 

        In developing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider safety testing methodologies, including, at a minimum—

            (A) pressure testing; and

            (B) other alternative methods, including in-line inspections, determined by the Secretary to be of equal or greater effectiveness.

        (3)  __Completion of testing__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and State regulators, as appropriate, shall establish timeframes for the completion of such testing that take into account potential consequences to public safety and the environment and that minimize costs and service disruptions.

    (e)  __High-consequence Area Defined__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “high-consequence area” means an area described in section 60109(a).

(Added [Pub. L. 112–90][/us/pl/112/90], § 23(a), Jan. 3, 2012, [125 Stat. 1918][/us/stat/125/1918].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The date of enactment of this section, referred to in subsecs. (a)(1), (b)(1), and (d)(1), is the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 112–90][/us/pl/112/90], which was approved Jan. 3, 2012.
