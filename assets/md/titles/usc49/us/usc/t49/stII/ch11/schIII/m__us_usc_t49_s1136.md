        (1) designate and publicize the name and phone number of a director of family support services who shall be an employee of the Board and shall be responsible for acting as a point of contact within the Federal Government for the families of passengers involved in the accident and a liaison between the air carrier or foreign air carrier and the families; and

        (2) designate an independent nonprofit organization, with experience in disasters and posttrauma communication with families, which shall have primary responsibility for coordinating the emotional care and support of the families of passengers involved in the accident.

    (b)  __Responsibilities of the Board__  __.—__ 

    The Board shall have primary Federal responsibility for facilitating the recovery and identification of fatally-injured passengers involved in an accident described in subsection (a).

        (1) To provide mental health and counseling services, in coordination with the disaster response team of the air carrier or foreign air carrier involved.

        (2) To take such actions as may be necessary to provide an environment in which the families may grieve in private.

        (3) To meet with the families who have traveled to the location of the accident, to contact the families unable to travel to such location, and to contact all affected families periodically thereafter until such time as the organization, in consultation with the director of family support services designated for the accident under subsection (a)(1), determines that further assistance is no longer needed.

        (4) To communicate with the families as to the roles of the organization, government agencies, and the air carrier or foreign air carrier involved with respect to the accident and the post-accident activities.

        (5) To arrange a suitable memorial service, in consultation with the families.

    (d) __Passenger Lists.—__ 

        (1) __Requests for passenger lists.—__ 

            (A)  __Requests by director of family support services__  __.—__ 

            It shall be the responsibility of the director of family support services designated for an accident under subsection (a)(1) to request, as soon as practicable, from the air carrier or foreign air carrier involved in the accident a list, which is based on the best available information at the time of the request, of the names of the passengers that were aboard the aircraft involved in the accident.

            (B)  __Requests by designated organization__  __.—__ 

            The organization designated for an accident under subsection (a)(2) may request from the air carrier or foreign air carrier involved in the accident a list described in subparagraph (A).

        (2)  __Use of information__  __.—__ 

        The director of family support services and the organization may not release to any person information on a list obtained under paragraph (1) but may provide information on the list about a passenger to the family of the passenger to the extent that the director of family support services or the organization considers appropriate.

    (e)  __Continuing Responsibilities of the Board__  __.—__ 

    In the course of its investigation of an accident described in subsection (a), the Board shall, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that the families of passengers involved in the accident—

        (1) are briefed, prior to any public briefing, about the accident, its causes, and any other findings from the investigation; and

        (2) are individually informed of and allowed to attend any public hearings and meetings of the Board about the accident.

    (f)  __Use of Air Carrier Resources__  __.—__ 

    To the extent practicable, the organization designated for an accident under subsection (a)(2) shall coordinate its activities with the air carrier or foreign air carrier involved in the accident so that the resources of the carrier can be used to the greatest extent possible to carry out the organization’s responsibilities under this section.

    (g) __Prohibited Actions.—__ 

        (1)  __Actions to impede the board__  __.—__ 

        No person (including a State or political subdivision) may impede the ability of the Board (including the director of family support services designated for an accident under subsection (a)(1)), or an organization designated for an accident under subsection (a)(2), to carry out its responsibilities under this section or the ability of the families of passengers involved in the accident to have contact with one another.

        (2)  __Unsolicited communications__  __.—__ 

        In the event of an accident involving an air carrier providing interstate or foreign air transportation and in the event of an accident involving a foreign air carrier that occurs within the United States, no unsolicited communication concerning a potential action for personal injury or wrongful death may be made by an attorney (including any associate, agent, employee, or other representative of an attorney) or any potential party to the litigation to an individual injured in the accident, or to a relative of an individual involved in the accident, before the 45th day following the date of the accident.

        (3)  __Prohibition on actions to prevent mental health and counseling services__  __.—__ 

        No State or political subdivision thereof may prevent the employees, agents, or volunteers of an organization designated for an accident under subsection (a)(2) from providing mental health and counseling services under subsection (c)(1) in the 30-day period beginning on the date of the accident. The director of family support services designated for the accident under subsection (a)(1) may extend such period for not to exceed an additional 30 days if the director determines that the extension is necessary to meet the needs of the families and if State and local authorities are notified of the determination.

    (h)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the following definitions apply:

        (1)  __Aircraft accident__  __.—__ 

        The term “aircraft accident” means any aviation disaster regardless of its cause or suspected cause.

        (2)  __Passenger__  __.—__ 

        The term “passenger” includes—

            (A) an employee of an air carrier or foreign air carrier aboard an aircraft; and

            (B) any other person aboard the aircraft without regard to whether the person paid for the transportation, occupied a seat, or held a reservation for the flight.

    (i)  __Statutory Construction__  __.—__ 

    Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the actions that an air carrier may take, or the obligations that an air carrier may have, in providing assistance to the families of passengers involved in an aircraft accident.

    (j) __Relinquishment of Investigative Priority.—__ 

        (1)  __General rule__  __.—__ 

        This section (other than subsection (g)) shall not apply to an aircraft accident if the Board has relinquished investigative priority under section 1131(a)(2)(B) and the Federal agency to which the Board relinquished investigative priority is willing and able to provide assistance to the victims and families of the passengers involved in the accident.

        (2)  __Board assistance__  __.—__ 

        If this section does not apply to an aircraft accident because the Board has relinquished investigative priority with respect to the accident, the Board shall assist, to the maximum extent possible, the agency to which the Board has relinquished investigative priority in assisting families with respect to the accident.
