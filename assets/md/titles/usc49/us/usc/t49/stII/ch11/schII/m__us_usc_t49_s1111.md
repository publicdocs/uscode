    In subsection (a), the words “previously established within the Department of Transportation” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “in accordance with this section, on and after April 1, 1975” are omitted as executed.

The words “including investigators, attorneys, and administrative law judges” are omitted as covered by “officers and employees”. The words “carry out this chapter” are substituted for “carry out its powers and duties under this chapter” to eliminate unnecessary words.
