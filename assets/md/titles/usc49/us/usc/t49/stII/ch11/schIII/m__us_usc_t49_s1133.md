    In clause (1), the word “certificate” is substituted for “operating certificate” for consistency in the revised title. The words “or license” are omitted as unnecessary because only certificates are issued under the sections cited in this section.

    In clause (3), the words “head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating” are substituted for “Commandant of the Coast Guard” for consistency with 14:5 and 46:2101(34).

    Clause (4) is added to reflect all the appellate responsibilities of the National Transportation Safety Board.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
