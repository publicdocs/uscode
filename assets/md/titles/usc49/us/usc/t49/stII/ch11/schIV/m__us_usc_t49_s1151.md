    In this section, the words “section 1132, 1134(b) or (f)(1) (related to an aircraft accident), or 1155(a) of this title” are substituted for “issued under this chapter” and “provisions of this chapter” because those sections restate the relevant provisions of 49 App.:ch. 20 carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the word “rule” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulation”. The word “requirement” is omitted as being included in “order”. The words “or any term, condition, or limitation of any certificate or permit” are omitted because the National Transportation Safety Board does not have authority to issue certificates or permits.

In subsection (a), the words “their duly authorized agents” are omitted as surplus. The words “may bring a civil action” are substituted for “may apply” in 49 App.:1487(a) for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “An action under this subsection may be brought in the judicial district in which” are substituted for “for any district wherein” for clarity. The text of 49 App.:1487(a) (words after semicolon) is omitted as unnecessary because of rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “Attorney General” are substituted for “any district attorney of the United States” in 49 App.:1487(b) because of 28:509. The words “to whom the Board or Secretary of Transportation may apply” are omitted as surplus. The words “may bring a civil action” are substituted for “is authorized to institute . . . all necessary proceedings” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “under the direction of the Attorney General” are omitted as unnecessary because of 28:516. The text of 49 App.:1487(b) (words after last comma) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (c), the words “civil action” are substituted for “proceeding in court” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).
