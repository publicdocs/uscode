 __Signal Protection__ 

[Pub. L. 114–94, div. A, title XI, § 11408][/us/pl/114/94/s11408], Dec. 4, 2015, [129 Stat. 1684][/us/stat/129/1684], provided that:

>     “(a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

>     Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act \[Dec. 4, 2015\], the Secretary \[of Transportation\] shall initiate a rulemaking to require that on-track safety regulations, whenever practicable and consistent with other safety requirements and operational considerations, include requiring implementation of redundant signal protection for maintenance-of-way work crews who depend on a train dispatcher to provide signal protection.

>     “(b)  __Alternative Safety Measures__  __.—__ 

>     The Secretary shall consider exempting from any final requirements of this section each segment of track for which operations are governed by a positive train control system certified under [section 20157 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s20157], United States Code, or any other safety technology or practice that would achieve an equivalent or greater level of safety in providing additional signal protection.”
