## § 24101. Findings, mission, and goals

    (a) __Findings.—__ 

        (1) Public convenience and necessity require that Amtrak, to the extent its budget allows, provide modern, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient intercity rail passenger transportation between crowded urban areas and in other areas of the United States.

        (2) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate overcrowding of airways and airports and on highways.

        (3) A traveler in the United States should have the greatest possible choice of transportation most convenient to the needs of the traveler.

        (4) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among Amtrak, other rail carriers, State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment to Amtrak to achieve a performance level sufficient to justify expending public money.

        (5) Modern and efficient commuter rail passenger transportation is important to the viability and well-being of major urban areas and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of the United States.

        (6) As a rail passenger transportation entity, Amtrak should be available to operate commuter rail passenger transportation through its subsidiary, Amtrak Commuter, under contract with commuter authorities that do not provide the transportation themselves as part of the governmental function of the State.

        (7) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation and freight transportation.

        (8) Greater coordination between intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation is required.

    (b) __Mission.—__ 

    The mission of Amtrak is to provide efficient and effective intercity passenger rail mobility consisting of high quality service that is trip-time competitive with other intercity travel options and that is consistent with the goals of subsection (d).

    (c) __Goals.—__ 

    Amtrak shall—

        (1)

         use its best business judgment in acting to minimize United States Government subsidies, including—

            (A) increasing fares;

            (B) increasing revenue from the transportation of mail and express;

            (C) reducing losses on food service;

            (D) improving its contracts with operating rail carriers;

            (E) reducing management costs; and

            (F) increasing employee productivity;

        (2) minimize Government subsidies by encouraging State, regional, and local governments and the private sector, separately or in combination, to share the cost of providing rail passenger transportation, including the cost of operating facilities;

        (3) carry out strategies to achieve immediately maximum productivity and efficiency consistent with safe and efficient transportation;

        (4) operate Amtrak trains, to the maximum extent feasible, to all station stops within 15 minutes of the time established in public timetables;

        (5) develop transportation on rail corridors subsidized by States and private parties;

        (6) implement schedules based on a systemwide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be achieved with a degree of reliability and passenger comfort;

        (7) encourage rail carriers to assist in improving intercity rail passenger transportation;

        (8) improve generally the performance of Amtrak through comprehensive and systematic operational programs and employee incentives;

        (9) provide additional or complementary intercity transportation service to ensure mobility in times of national disaster or other instances where other travel options are not adequately available;

        (10) carry out policies that ensure equitable access to the Northeast Corridor by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation;

        (11) coordinate the uses of the Northeast Corridor, particularly intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation; and

        (12) maximize the use of its resources, including the most cost-effective use of employees, facilities, and real property.

    (d) __Minimizing Government Subsidies.—__ 

    To carry out subsection (c)(12) of this section, Amtrak is encouraged to make agreements with the private sector and undertake initiatives that are consistent with good business judgment and designed to maximize its revenues and minimize Government subsidies. Amtrak shall prepare a financial plan, consistent with section 204 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, including the budgetary goals for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Amtrak and its Board of Directors shall adopt a long-term plan that minimizes the need for Federal operating subsidies.

    In this part, the word “Amtrak” is substituted for “National Railroad Passenger Corporation”, and the words “Amtrak Commuter” are substituted for “Amtrak Commuter Services Corporation”, to reflect the more current and commonly used names of the entities. The words “rail transportation” are substituted for “rail service” and “rail services”, the word “transportation” is substituted for “service” where appropriate, and the word “authority” is substituted for “agency”, as being more appropriate and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “rail carrier” are substituted for “railroad” because of the definitions of “rail carrier” and “railroad” in 49:10102.

    In subsection (a), the words “The Congress finds that the” and “The Congress further finds that” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “greatest possible choice of” are substituted for “to the maximum extent feasible . . . the freedom to choose the mode of” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “Amtrak shall” are substituted for “The Congress hereby establishes the following goals for Amtrak” to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 45:501a(3) and (4) is omitted as executed. The text of 45:501a(9) is omitted as obsolete because there no longer are any technical assistance panels. In clause (2), the words “stations and other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (4), the words “for such operation” are omitted as surplus. In clause (10), the word “various” is omitted as surplus. In clause (11), the words “real property” are substituted for “real estate” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 204 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, referred to in subsec. (d), is [section 204 of Pub. L. 110–432][/us/pl/110/432/s204], which is set out in a note below.

Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “By using innovative operating and marketing concepts, Amtrak shall provide intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation that completely develops the potential of modern rail transportation to meet the intercity and commuter passenger transportation needs of the United States.”

    Subsec. (c)(9) to (12). [Pub. L. 110–432, § 201(e)(1)(C)][/us/pl/110/432/s201/e/1/C], added par. (9) and redesignated former pars. (9) to (11) as (10) to (12), respectively.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub.

>     “(a) __Methodology Development.—__ 

>     Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \[Oct. 16, 2008\], the Federal Railroad Administration shall obtain the services of a qualified independent entity to develop and recommend objective methodologies for Amtrak to use in determining what intercity passenger routes and services it will provide, including the establishment of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and the contraction or expansion of services or frequencies over such routes. In developing such methodologies, the entity shall consider—

>         “(1) the current or expected performance and service quality of intercity passenger train operations, including cost recovery, on-time performance and minutes of delay, ridership, on-board services, stations, facilities, equipment, and other services;
