    In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), the words “(beginning with 1973)” are omitted as executed. The word “complete” is substituted for “comprehensive and detailed” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “under this chapter” are omitted as surplus. The word “revenues” is substituted for “receipts” for consistency. In clause (B), the words “may include recommendations for legislation” are substituted for “At the time of its annual report, the Corporation shall submit such legislative recommendations as it deems desirable”, the words “the method of computing the assistance” are substituted for “the manner and form in which the amount of such assistance should be computed”, and the words “of the assistance” are substituted for “from which such assistance should be derived”, to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), the words “(beginning with 1974)” are omitted as executed. The word “prepare” is substituted for “transmit to the President and to the Congress by March 15 of each year” for clarity because the report is now part of the annual report under 49:308(a). The words “Beginning in 1976” are omitted as executed. The word “Secretary” is substituted for “Department of Transportation” because of 49:102(b).

    In subsection (d), the words “independent licensed public accountants certified or licensed by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States” are omitted as obsolete because only certified public accountants are used for the audit. Only noncertified public accountants licensed before December 30, 1970, who were already conducting audits were allowed to continue. The words “or places” are omitted because of 1:1. The words “financial statements” are substituted for “accounts” because audits are performed on financial statements, not accounts. The words “independent” and “annual” are omitted as surplus. The text of 45:644(1)(B) (last sentence) is omitted as surplus because those requirements are included in “generally accepted auditing standards”.

    In subsection (e), the word “rules” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulations”. The words “or places” are omitted because of 1:1. The word “appropriate” is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (f), the words “if required” are substituted for “To the extent . . . deems necessary” to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words “may keep” are substituted for “shall remain in possession and custody of” and “shall remain in the possession and custody of” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (g), the word “giving” is substituted for “The report to the Congress shall contain such” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “as the Comptroller General may deem”, “as he may deem advisable”, “program, expenditure or other”, “observed in the course of the audit”, and “or made” are omitted as surplus.
