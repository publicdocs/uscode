## § 20110. Effect on employee qualifications and collective bargaining

    This chapter does not—

    (1) authorize the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations and issue orders related to qualifications of employees, except qualifications specifically related to safety; or

    (2) prohibit the bargaining representatives of railroad carriers and their employees from making collective bargaining agreements under the Railway Labor Act ([45 U.S.C. 151][/us/usc/t45/s151] et seq.), including agreements related to qualifications of employees, that are not inconsistent with regulations prescribed and orders issued under this chapter.

([Pub. L. 103–272][/us/pl/103/272], § 1(e), July 5, 1994, [108 Stat. 868][/us/stat/108/868].)
