    In subsections (a) and (b), the words “may bring a civil action”, “may bring the civil action”, and “in a civil action brought by” are substituted for “upon petition of” and “on petition of” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).

    In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words “Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection” are added for clarity. The word “only” is added for clarity. See National Railroad Passenger Corp. et al. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453 (1974). In clauses (A) and (D)(i), the words “the policies and purposes of” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(2), the word “duly” is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), the words “in any court” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (c) is substituted for 45:547(a) (1st sentence words between 13th–15th commas) for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The text of 45:547(b) is omitted as surplus.
