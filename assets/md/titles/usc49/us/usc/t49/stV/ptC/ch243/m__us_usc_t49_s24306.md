## § 24306. Mail, express, and auto-ferry transportation

    (a)  __Actions To Increase Revenues__  __.—__ 

    Amtrak shall take necessary action to increase its revenues from the transportation of mail and express. To increase its revenues, Amtrak may provide auto-ferry transportation as part of the basic passenger transportation authorized by this part.

    (b)  __Authority of Others To Provide Auto-Ferry Transportation__  __.—__ 

    State and local laws and regulations that impair the provision of auto-ferry transportation do not apply to Amtrak or a rail carrier providing auto-ferry transportation. A rail carrier may not refuse to participate with Amtrak in providing auto-ferry transportation because a State or local law or regulation makes the transportation unlawful.

    In subsection (a), the words “and to better accomplish the purposes of this chapter” and “modify its services to” are omitted as surplus.

The words “consistent with the provisions of existing law” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), the words “A person primarily providing auto-ferry transportation and any other person not a rail carrier may provide” are substituted for “except that nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any other person, other than a railroad (except that for purposes of this section a person primarily engaged in auto-ferry service shall not be deemed to be a railroad), from providing such” to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 45:545(b) (2d sentence words after “the public”) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “may provide” are substituted for “Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the right of . . . from performing” to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity.

    In subsection (b)(3), the words “has the effect of prohibiting or”, “fine, penalty, or other”, and “for violation of” are omitted as surplus. The words “rail carrier” are substituted for “common carrier by railroad” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
