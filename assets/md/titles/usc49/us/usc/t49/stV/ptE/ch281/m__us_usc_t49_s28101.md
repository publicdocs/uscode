    (b)  __Assignment__  __.—__ 

    A railroad police officer employed by a railroad carrier and certified or commissioned as a police officer under the laws of a State may be temporarily assigned to assist a second railroad carrier in carrying out law enforcement duties upon the request of the second railroad carrier, at which time the police officer shall be considered to be an employee of the second railroad carrier and shall have authority to enforce the laws of any jurisdiction in which the second railroad carrier owns property to the same extent as provided in subsection (a).

    The words “to the extent of the authority of a police officer certified or commissioned under the laws of that jurisdiction” are placed before clause (1) rather than at the end of clause (4), as in the source provision, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    2007—[Pub. L. 110–53][/us/pl/110/53] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, and added subsec. (b).

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–440][/us/pl/103/440] renumbered [section 26101 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s26101] as this section.
