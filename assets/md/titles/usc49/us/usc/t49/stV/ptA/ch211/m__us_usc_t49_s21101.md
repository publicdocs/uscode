    Clause (2) is added to avoid the necessity of repeating the substance of the definition every time a “dispatching service employee” is referred to in this chapter. The language in clause (2) is derived from 45:63.

    Clause (3) is added to provide a definition of “employee” when the source provisions apply to all types of employees covered by this chapter.

    Clause (4) is added to avoid the necessity of repeating the substance of the definition every time a “signal employee” is referred to in this chapter. The language in clause (4) is derived from 45:63a.

    In clause (5), the words “train employee” are substituted for “employee” to distinguish the term from the terms “dispatching service employee” and “signal employee”. The word “actually” is omitted as surplus.
