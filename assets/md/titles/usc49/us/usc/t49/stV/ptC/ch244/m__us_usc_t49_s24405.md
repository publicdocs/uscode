        (2)

         The Secretary of Transportation may waive paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary finds that—

            (A) applying paragraph (1) would be inconsistent with the public interest;

            (B) the steel, iron, and goods produced in the United States are not produced in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or are not of a satisfactory quality;

            (C) rolling stock or power train equipment cannot be bought and delivered in the United States within a reasonable time; or

        (3) For purposes of this subsection, in calculating the components’ costs, labor costs involved in final assembly shall not be included in the calculation.

        (4)

         If the Secretary determines that it is necessary to waive the application of paragraph (1) based on a finding under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, before the date on which such finding takes effect—

            (A) publish in the Federal Register a detailed written justification as to why the waiver is needed; and

            (B) provide notice of such finding and an opportunity for public comment on such finding for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 15 days.

        (6)

         The Secretary of Transportation may not make a waiver under paragraph (2) of this subsection for goods produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, decides that the government of that foreign country—

            (A) has an agreement with the United States Government under which the Secretary has waived the requirement of this subsection; and

            (B) has violated the agreement by discriminating against goods to which this subsection applies that are produced in the United States and to which the agreement applies.

            (B) represented that goods described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph were produced in the United States.

        (8) The Secretary may not impose any limitation on assistance provided under this chapter that restricts a State from imposing more stringent requirements than this subsection on the use of articles, materials, and supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries in projects carried out with that assistance or restricts a recipient of that assistance from complying with those State-imposed requirements.

        (9) The Secretary may allow a manufacturer or supplier of steel, iron, or manufactured goods to correct after bid opening any certification of noncompliance or failure to properly complete the certification (but not including failure to sign the certification) under this subsection if such manufacturer or supplier attests under penalty of perjury that such manufacturer or supplier submitted an incorrect certification as a result of an inadvertent or clerical error.

            (D) an assurance that an applicant complies with liability requirements consistent with [section 28103 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s28103]; and

            (B) the protective arrangements established under section 504 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 ([45 U.S.C. 836][/us/usc/t45/s836]) with respect to employees affected by actions taken in connection with the project to be financed in whole or in part by grants under this chapter.

    (d) __Replacement of Existing Intercity Passenger Rail Service.—__ 

        (1) __Collective bargaining agreement for intercity passenger rail projects.—__

            (B) establishes a procedure for notifying such an employee of such positions;

            (C) establishes a procedure for such an employee to apply for such positions; and

            (D) establishes rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.

        (2) __Immediate replacement service.—__ 

            (A) __Negotiations.—__ 

            If the replacement of preexisting intercity rail passenger service occurs concurrent with or within a reasonable time before the commencement of the replacing entity’s rail passenger service, the replacing entity shall give written notice of its plan to replace existing rail passenger service to the authorized collective bargaining agent or agents for the potentially adversely affected employees of the predecessor provider at least 90 days before the date on which it plans to commence service. Within 5 days after the date of receipt of such written notice, negotiations between the replacing entity and the collective bargaining agent or agents for the employees of the predecessor provider shall commence for the purpose of reaching agreement with respect to all matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). The negotiations shall continue for 30 days or until an agreement is reached, whichever is sooner. If at the end of 30 days the parties have not entered into an agreement with respect to all such matters, the unresolved issues shall be submitted for arbitration in accordance with the procedure set forth in subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Arbitration.—__ 

            If an agreement has not been entered into with respect to all matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) as described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the parties shall select an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the selection of such arbitrator within 5 days, either or both parties shall notify the National Mediation Board, which shall provide a list of seven arbitrators with experience in arbitrating rail labor protection disputes. Within 5 days after such notification, the parties shall alternately strike names from the list until only 1 name remains, and that person shall serve as the neutral arbitrator. Within 45 days after selection of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall conduct a hearing on the dispute and shall render a decision with respect to the unresolved issues among the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). The arbitrator shall be guided by prevailing national standard rates of pay, benefits, and working conditions for comparable work. This decision shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties. The salary and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties; all other expenses shall be paid by the party incurring them.

        (3) __Service commencement.—__ 

        A replacing entity under this subsection shall commence service only after an agreement is entered into with respect to the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) or the decision of the arbitrator has been rendered.

        (4) __Subsequent replacement of service.—__ 

        If the replacement of existing rail passenger service takes place within 3 years after the replacing entity commences intercity passenger rail service, the replacing entity and the collective bargaining agent or agents for the adversely affected employees of the predecessor provider shall enter into an agreement with respect to the matters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1). If the parties have not entered into an agreement with respect to all such matters within 60 days after the date on which the replacing entity replaces the predecessor provider, the parties shall select an arbitrator using the procedures set forth in paragraph (2)(B), who shall, within 20 days after the commencement of the arbitration, conduct a hearing and decide all unresolved issues. This decision shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties.

    (e) __Inapplicability to Certain Rail Operations.—__ 

    Nothing in this section applies to—

        (1) commuter rail passenger transportation (as defined in section 24102(4) 2 of this title) operations of a State or local government  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original.
