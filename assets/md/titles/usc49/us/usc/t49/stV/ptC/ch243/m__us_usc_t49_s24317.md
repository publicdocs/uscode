        Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015, Amtrak, in consultation with the Secretary, shall implement any account structures and improvements defined under subsection (b) so that Amtrak is able to produce profit and loss statements for each of the business lines described in section 24320(b)(1) and, as appropriate, each of the asset categories described in section 24320(c)(1) that identify sources and uses of—

    (f) __ Account Management__  __.—__ 

    For the purposes of account management, Amtrak may transfer funds between the Northeast Corridor account and National Network account without prior notification and approval under subsection (g) if such transfers—

        (1) do not materially impact Amtrak’s ability to achieve its anticipated financial, capital, and operating performance goals for the fiscal year; and

        (2) would not materially change any grant agreement entered into pursuant to section 24319(d), or other agreements made pursuant to applicable Federal law.

    (g) __Transfer Authority.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        If Amtrak determines that a transfer between the accounts defined under subsection (b) does not meet the account management standards established under subsection (f), Amtrak may transfer funds between the Northeast Corridor and National Network accounts if—

            (A) Amtrak notifies the Amtrak Board of Directors, including the Secretary, at least 10 days prior to the expected date of transfer; and

            (B) solely for a transfer that will materially change a grant agreement, the Secretary approves.

        (2)  __Report__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 5 days after the Amtrak Board of Directors receives notification from Amtrak under paragraph (1)(A), the Board shall transmit to the Secretary, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a report that includes—

            (A) the amount of the transfer; and

            (B)

             a detailed explanation of the reason for the transfer, including—

                (i) the effects on Amtrak services funded by the account from which the transfer is drawn, in comparison to a scenario in which no transfer was made; and

                (ii) the effects on Amtrak services funded by the account receiving the transfer, in comparison to a scenario in which no transfer was made.

        (3)  __Notifications__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 5 days after the date that Amtrak notifies the Amtrak Board of Directors of a transfer under paragraph (1) to or from an account, Amtrak shall transmit to the State-Supported Route Committee and Northeast Corridor Commission a letter that includes the information described under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2).

    (h)  __Report__  __.—__ 

    Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015, Amtrak shall submit to the Secretary a report assessing the account and reporting structure established under this section and providing any recommendations for further action. Not later than 180 days after the date of receipt of such report, the Secretary shall provide an assessment that supplements Amtrak’s report and submit the Amtrak report with the supplemental assessment to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

    (i)  __Definition of Northeast Corridor__  __.—__
