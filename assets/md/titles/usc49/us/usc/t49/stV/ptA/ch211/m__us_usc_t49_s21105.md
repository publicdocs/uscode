    In this section, the words “dispatching service employee” are substituted for “operator, train dispatcher, or other employee who by the use of the telegraph, telephone, radio, or any other electrical or mechanical device dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements” in 45:63(a), “employee . . . on duty in a class of service . . . described in paragraph (1) or (2) of such subsection” in 45:63(b), and “employees named in such subsection” in 45:63(c) because of the definition of “dispatching service employee” in section 21101 of the revised title.

    In subsection (a), the words “This section applies, rather than section 21103 or 21104 of this title” are substituted for “The provisions of this section shall not apply” because of the restatement. The words “train employee” are substituted for “employee” in 45:62(d), and the words “signal employee” are substituted for “individual” in 45:63a(e), for consistency in this chapter and because of the definitions of “signal employee” and “train employee” in section 21101 of the revised title.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “a total of” are substituted for “whether consecutive or in the aggregate” to eliminate unnecessary words.
