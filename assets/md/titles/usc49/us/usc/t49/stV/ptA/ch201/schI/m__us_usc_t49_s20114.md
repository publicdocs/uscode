    In subsection (a), the words “the defendant may demand a jury trial” are substituted for “trial shall be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (b), the words “may be served in any judicial district” are substituted for “may run into any other district” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “a final action of the Secretary” are substituted for “Any final agency action taken by the Secretary” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “this part or, as applicable to railroad safety, chapter 51 or 57 of this title” are substituted for “this subchapter or under any of the other Federal railroad safety laws, as defined in [section 441(e) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s441/e]” because of the restatement. The words “is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5” are omitted as unnecessary because 5:ch. 7 applies unless otherwise stated. The words “by and in the manner prescribed” are omitted as surplus.
