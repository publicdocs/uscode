## § 45106. Relationship to other laws, regulations, standards, and orders

    (a)  __Effect on State and Local Government Laws, Regulations, Standards, or Orders__  __.—__ 

    A State or local government may not prescribe, issue, or continue in effect a law, regulation, standard, or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this chapter. However, a regulation prescribed under this chapter does not preempt a State criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life, injury, or damage to property.

    (b)  __International Obligations and Foreign Laws__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         In prescribing regulations under this chapter, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration—

            (A) shall establish only requirements applicable to foreign air carriers that are consistent with international obligations of the United States; and

            (B) shall consider applicable laws and regulations of foreign countries.

        (2) The Secretaries of State and Transportation jointly shall request the governments of foreign countries that are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization to strengthen and enforce existing standards to prohibit crewmembers in international civil aviation from using alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of law or a United States Government regulation.

    (c)  __Other Regulations Allowed__  __.—__ 

    This section does not prevent the Administrator from continuing in effect, amending, or further supplementing a regulation prescribed before October 28, 1991, governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance by airmen, crewmembers, airport security screening employees, air carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as decided by the Administrator), or employees of the Administration with responsibility for safety-sensitive functions.

    In subsection (a), the word “prescribe” is substituted for “adopt” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word “rule” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulation”. The word “ordinance” is omitted as being included in “law” and “regulation”. The words “actual” and “whether the provisions apply specifically to employees of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, or to the general public” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c) the word “prevent” is substituted for “restrict the discretion of” to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __Amendments__ 

    2001—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 107–71][/us/pl/107/71] substituted “screening employees” for “screening contract employees”.
