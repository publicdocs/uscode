## § 40122. Federal Aviation Administration personnel management system

    (a) __In General.—__ 

        (1)  __Consultation and negotiation__  __.—__ 

        In developing and making changes to the personnel management system initially implemented by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration on April 1, 1996, the Administrator shall negotiate with the exclusive bargaining representatives of employees of the Administration certified under [section 7111 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s7111] and consult with other employees of the Administration.

        (2) __Dispute resolution.—__ 

            (A)  __Mediation__  __.—__ 

            If the Administrator does not reach an agreement under paragraph (1) or the provisions referred to in subsection (g)(2)(C) with the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees, the Administrator and the bargaining representative—

                (i) shall use the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to attempt to reach such agreement in accordance with part 1425 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012); or

                (ii) may by mutual agreement adopt alternative procedures for the resolution of disputes or impasses arising in the negotiation of the collective-bargaining agreement.

            (B)  __Mid-term bargaining__  __.—__ 

            If the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under subparagraph (A)(i) do not lead to the resolution of issues in controversy arising from the negotiation of a mid-term collective-bargaining agreement, the Federal Service Impasses Panel shall assist the parties in resolving the impasse in accordance with [section 7119 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s7119].

            (C) __Binding arbitration for term bargaining.—__ 

                (i)  __Assistance from federal service impasses panel__  __.—__ 

                If the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under subparagraph (A)(i) do not lead to the resolution of issues in controversy arising from the negotiation of a term collective-bargaining agreement, the Administrator and the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees (in this subparagraph referred to as the “parties”) shall submit their issues in controversy to the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The Panel shall assist the parties in resolving the impasse by asserting jurisdiction and ordering binding arbitration by a private arbitration board consisting of 3 members.

                (ii)  __Appointment of arbitration board__  __.—__ 

                The Executive Director of the Panel shall provide for the appointment of the 3 members of a private arbitration board under clause (i) by requesting the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to prepare a list of not less than 15 names of arbitrators with Federal sector experience and by providing the list to the parties. Not later than 10 days after receiving the list, the parties shall each select one person from the list. The 2 arbitrators selected by the parties shall then select a third person from the list not later than 7 days after being selected. If either of the parties fails to select a person or if the 2 arbitrators are unable to agree on the third person in 7 days, the parties shall make the selection by alternately striking names on the list until one arbitrator remains.

                (iii)  __Framing issues in controversy__  __.—__ 

                If the parties do not agree on the framing of the issues to be submitted for arbitration, the arbitration board shall frame the issues.

                (iv)  __Hearings__  __.—__ 

                The arbitration board shall give the parties a full and fair hearing, including an opportunity to present evidence in support of their claims and an opportunity to present their case in person, by counsel, or by other representative as they may elect.

                (v)  __Decisions__  __.—__ 

                The arbitration board shall render its decision within 90 days after the date of its appointment. Decisions of the arbitration board shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.

                (vi)  __Matters for consideration__  __.—__ 

                The arbitration board shall take into consideration such factors as—

                    (I) the effect of its arbitration decisions on the Federal Aviation Administration’s ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce;

                    (II) the effect of its arbitration decisions on the Federal Aviation Administration’s budget; and

                    (III) any other factors whose consideration would assist the board in fashioning a fair and equitable award.

                (vii)  __Costs__  __.—__ 

                The parties shall share costs of the arbitration equally.

        (3)  __Ratification of agreements__  __.—__ 

        Upon reaching a voluntary agreement or at the conclusion of the binding arbitration under paragraph (2)(C), the final agreement, except for those matters decided by an arbitration board, shall be subject to ratification by the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees, if so requested by the bargaining representative, and the final agreement shall be subject to approval by the head of the agency in accordance with the provisions referred to in subsection (g)(2)(C).

        (4)  __Cost savings and productivity goals__  __.—__ 

        The Administration and the exclusive bargaining representatives of the employees shall use every reasonable effort to find cost savings and to increase productivity within each of the affected bargaining units.

        (5)  __Annual budget discussions__  __.—__ 

        The Administration and the exclusive bargaining representatives of the employees shall meet annually for the purpose of finding additional cost savings within the Administration’s annual budget as it applies to each of the affected bargaining units and throughout the agency.

    (b)  __Expert Evaluation__  __.—__ 

    On the date that is 3 years after the personnel management system is implemented, the Administration shall employ outside experts to provide an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the system within 3 months after such date. For this purpose, the Administrator may utilize the services of experts and consultants under [section 3109 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3109] without regard to the limitation imposed by the last sentence of section 3109(b) of such title, and may contract on a sole source basis, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary.

    (c)  __Pay Restriction__  __.—__ 

    No officer or employee of the Administration may receive an annual rate of basic pay in excess of the annual rate of basic pay payable to the Administrator.

    (d)  __Ethics__  __.—__ 

    The Administration shall be subject to Executive Order No. 12674 and regulations and opinions promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics, including those set forth in [section 2635 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s2635] of the Code of Federal Regulations.
