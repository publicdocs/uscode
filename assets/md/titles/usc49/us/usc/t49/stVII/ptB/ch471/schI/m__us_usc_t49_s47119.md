        (4)  __Conditions for grant__  __.—__ 

        An amount is available for a grant under this subsection only if—

            (A) the sponsor submits the certification required under subsection (a);

        (4) not more than $25,000,000 to pay project costs allowable for the fiscal year under subsection (a) for projects at commercial service airports that were not eligible for assistance for terminal development during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 20(b) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970; or

    (f) __Limitation on Discretionary Funds.—__ 

    The Secretary may distribute not more than $20,000,000 from the discretionary fund established under section 47115 for terminal development projects at a nonhub airport or a small hub airport that is eligible to receive discretionary funds under section 47108(e)(3).

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “(within the meaning of section 11(1) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 \[49 App. U.S.C. 1711(1)\] as in effect immediately before September 3, 1982)” are omitted because of the definition of “air carrier airport” in section 47102 of the revised title.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “In a fiscal year” are added for clarity. In clause (2), the words “from the discretionary fund” are substituted for “sums to be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary under section 2206(c) of this Appendix” for clarity and consistency in this chapter.
