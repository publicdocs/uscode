## § 40101. Policy

    (a)  __Economic Regulation__  __.—__ 

    In carrying out subpart II of this part and those provisions of subpart IV applicable in carrying out subpart II, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider the following matters, among others, as being in the public interest and consistent with public convenience and necessity:

        (1) assigning and maintaining safety as the highest priority in air commerce.

        (2) before authorizing new air transportation services, evaluating the safety implications of those services.

        (3) preventing deterioration in established safety procedures, recognizing the clear intent, encouragement, and dedication of Congress to further the highest degree of safety in air transportation and air commerce, and to maintain the safety vigilance that has evolved in air transportation and air commerce and has come to be expected by the traveling and shipping public.

        (4) the availability of a variety of adequate, economic, efficient, and low-priced services without unreasonable discrimination or unfair or deceptive practices.

        (5) coordinating transportation by, and improving relations among, air carriers, and encouraging fair wages and working conditions.

        (6)

         placing maximum reliance on competitive market forces and on actual and potential competition—

            (A) to provide the needed air transportation system; and

            (B) to encourage efficient and well-managed air carriers to earn adequate profits and attract capital, considering any material differences between interstate air transportation and foreign air transportation.

        (7)

         developing and maintaining a sound regulatory system that is responsive to the needs of the public and in which decisions are reached promptly to make it easier to adapt the air transportation system to the present and future needs of—

            (A) the commerce of the United States;

            (B) the United States Postal Service; and

            (C) the national defense.

        (8)

         encouraging air transportation at major urban areas through secondary or satellite airports if consistent with regional airport plans of regional and local authorities, and if endorsed by appropriate State authorities—

            (A) encouraging the transportation by air carriers that provide, in a specific market, transportation exclusively at those airports; and

            (B) fostering an environment that allows those carriers to establish themselves and develop secondary or satellite airport services.

        (9) preventing unfair, deceptive, predatory, or anticompetitive practices in air transportation.

        (10) avoiding unreasonable industry concentration, excessive market domination, monopoly powers, and other conditions that would tend to allow at least one air carrier or foreign air carrier unreasonably to increase prices, reduce services, or exclude competition in air transportation.

        (11) maintaining a complete and convenient system of continuous scheduled interstate air transportation for small communities and isolated areas with direct financial assistance from the United States Government when appropriate.

        (12)

         encouraging, developing, and maintaining an air transportation system relying on actual and potential competition—

            (A) to provide efficiency, innovation, and low prices; and

            (B) to decide on the variety and quality of, and determine prices for, air transportation services.

        (13) encouraging entry into air transportation markets by new and existing air carriers and the continued strengthening of small air carriers to ensure a more effective and competitive airline industry.

        (14) promoting, encouraging, and developing civil aeronautics and a viable, privately-owned United States air transport industry.

        (15) strengthening the competitive position of air carriers to at least ensure equality with foreign air carriers, including the attainment of the opportunity for air carriers to maintain and increase their profitability in foreign air transportation.

        (16) ensuring that consumers in all regions of the United States, including those in small communities and rural and remote areas, have access to affordable, regularly scheduled air service.

    (b)  __All-Cargo Air Transportation Considerations__  __.—__ 

    In carrying out subpart II of this part and those provisions of subpart IV applicable in carrying out subpart II, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider the following matters, among others and in addition to the matters referred to in subsection (a) of this section, as being in the public interest for all-cargo air transportation:

        (1)

         encouraging and developing an expedited all-cargo air transportation system provided by private enterprise and responsive to—

            (A) the present and future needs of shippers;

            (B) the commerce of the United States; and

            (C) the national defense.

        (2) encouraging and developing an integrated transportation system relying on competitive market forces to decide the extent, variety, quality, and price of services provided.

        (3) providing services without unreasonable discrimination, unfair or deceptive practices, or predatory pricing.

    (c)  __General Safety Considerations__  __.—__

    (d)  __Safety Considerations in Public Interest__  __.—__ 

    In carrying out subpart III of this part and those provisions of subpart IV applicable in carrying out subpart III, the Administrator shall consider the following matters, among others, as being in the public interest:

        (1) assigning, maintaining, and enhancing safety and security as the highest priorities in air commerce.

        (2) regulating air commerce in a way that best promotes safety and fulfills national defense requirements.

        (3) encouraging and developing civil aeronautics, including new aviation technology.

        (4) controlling the use of the navigable airspace and regulating civil and military operations in that airspace in the interest of the safety and efficiency of both of those operations.

        (5) consolidating research and development for air navigation facilities and the installation and operation of those facilities.

        (6) developing and operating a common system of air traffic control and navigation for military and civil aircraft.

        (7) providing assistance to law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of laws related to regulation of controlled substances, to the extent consistent with aviation safety.

    (e)  __International Air Transportation__  __.—__ 

    In formulating United States international air transportation policy, the Secretaries of State and Transportation shall develop a negotiating policy emphasizing the greatest degree of competition compatible with a well-functioning international air transportation system, including the following:

        (1) strengthening the competitive position of air carriers to ensure at least equality with foreign air carriers, including the attainment of the opportunity for air carriers to maintain and increase their profitability in foreign air transportation.

        (2) freedom of air carriers and foreign air carriers to offer prices that correspond to consumer demand.

        (3) the fewest possible restrictions on charter air transportation.

        (4) the maximum degree of multiple and permissive international authority for air carriers so that they will be able to respond quickly to a shift in market demand.

        (6) integrating domestic and international air transportation.

        (7) increasing the number of nonstop United States gateway cities.

        (8) opportunities for carriers of foreign countries to increase their access to places in the United States if exchanged for benefits of similar magnitude for air carriers or the traveling public with permanent linkage between rights granted and rights given away.

        (9)

    In this part, the words “overseas air commerce” and “overseas air transportation” are omitted as obsolete because there no longer is a distinction in economic or safety regulation between “interstate” and “overseas” air commerce or air transportation.

    In this section, the words “In carrying out . . . this part” are substituted for “In the exercise and performance of its powers and duties under this chapter” in 49 App.:1302(a), “In the exercise and performance of his powers and duties under this chapter” in 49 App.:1303, and “In exercising the authority granted in, and discharging the duties imposed by, this chapter” in 49 App.:1347 for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsections (a) and (b), the reference to subpart II is added because the policy applies only to economic issues, and under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 731][/us/stat/72/731]), the Civil Aeronautics Board was given responsibility for economic issues.

    In subsection (a)(2), the word “full” is omitted as surplus. The words “the recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation on” are omitted as obsolete because the Secretary carries out 49 App.:1302(a). The words “and full evaluation of any report or recommendation submitted under section 1307 of this Appendix” are omitted as obsolete because the report and recommendations are no longer required.

    In subsection (a)(4), the words “by air carriers and foreign air carriers” are omitted as surplus. The words “unreasonable discrimination” are substituted for “unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(6)(B), the words “nevertheless”, “on the one hand”, and “on the other” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(8), before subclause (A), the word “authorities” is substituted for “entities” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. In subclause (A), the words “sole responsibility” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.

    In subsection (a)(15), the words “United States” are omitted as surplus because of the definition of “air carrier” in section 40102(a) of the revised title.

    In subsection (b)(3), the words “unreasonable discrimination” are substituted for “unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsections (c) and (d), the reference to subpart III is added because the policies apply only to safety issues, and under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 731][/us/stat/72/731]), the Federal Aviation Administration was given responsibility for safety issues.

In subsection (c), before clause (1), the word “Administrator” in section 306 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 749][/us/stat/72/749]) is retained on authority of 49:106(g). The words “consider the following matters” are substituted for “give full consideration to” for consistency in this section.

    In subsection (d)(3), the word “both” in 49 App.:1303(c) is omitted as surplus the first time it appears. The words “of the United States” are omitted for consistency in the revised title and because of the definition of “navigable airspace” in section 40102(a) of the revised title. The words “of those operations” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (d)(5), the word “both” in 49 App.:1303(e) is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words “the Congress intends that” are omitted as surplus. In clauses (1) and (4), the words “United States” are omitted as surplus because of the definition of “air carrier” in section 40102(a) of the revised title. In clause (2), the word “prices” is substituted for “fares and rates” because of the definition of “price” in section 40102(a). In clause (8), the words “places in the United States” are substituted for “United States points” for consistency in this chapter. The word “air” is added for clarity and consistency in this subtitle. In clause (9)(C), the word “unreasonable” is substituted for “undue” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
