    In this section, the words “for an airport development project carried out under a grant agreement under this subchapter” are substituted for “on any project for airport development contained in an approved project grant application submitted in accordance with this chapter” in 49 App.:2214(a), “on projects for airport development approved under this chapter” in 49 App.:2214(b), and “under project grants for airport development approved under this chapter” in 49 App.:2214(c) for clarity and consistency in this section.

    Subsection (c)(1)(A) is substituted for “a disabled veteran is an individual described in [section 2108(2) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s2108/2]” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.

    In subsection (c)(1)(B), the words “after August 4, 1964, and before May 8, 1975” are substituted for “during the period beginning August 5, 1964, and ending May 7, 1975” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “must require that” are substituted for “shall contain such provisions as are necessary to insure that”, and the words “when they are available and qualified for the employment” are substituted for “However, this preference shall apply only where the individuals are available and qualified to perform the work to which the employment relates”, to eliminate unnecessary words.
