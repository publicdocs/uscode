    In subsection (a)(1), the text of 49 App.:1371(e)(1) (words before semicolon related to terminal and intermediate points) is omitted as obsolete because of 49 App.:1551(a)(1)(C) and because interstate and overseas air transportation is no longer regulated. The words “type of” are added for clarity. The word “provided” is substituted for “rendered” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words before clause (A) are added for clarity. Clause (A) is substituted for 49 App.:1371(e)(1) (words after semicolon) for clarity and consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (B), the words “may not prescribe a term preventing” are substituted for “No term, condition, or limitation of a certificate shall restrict the right” for clarity and consistency. The word “providing” is substituted for “performing” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(3) and (4), the word “places” is substituted for “points”, and the word “provide” is substituted for “engage in”, for consistency in the revised title. The words “terminal and intermediate” are omitted as surplus. The words “between which the air carrier is authorized to provide the transportation” are added for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “or routes” are omitted because of 1:1. The words “The Secretary” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (a)(4), the words “or areas” are omitted because of 1:1.

    In subsection (b), the words “condition, or limitation” are omitted as being included in “term”.

    In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), the word “modify” is substituted for “removal or modification” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “provide” is substituted for “engage in” for consistency in the revised title. In clause (A), the words “provide the carrier an opportunity” are substituted for “set such application” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. In clause (B), the words “the simplified procedures established by the Board in regulations pursuant to” are omitted as surplus.
