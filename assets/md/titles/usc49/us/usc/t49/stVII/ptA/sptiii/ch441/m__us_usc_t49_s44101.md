    In this section, the word “navigate” is omitted as being included in the definition of “operate aircraft” in section 40102(a) of the revised title.

    In subsection (a), the words “Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section” are added for clarity. The words “a person may . . . an aircraft only when the aircraft is registered under [section 44103 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44103]” are substituted for “It shall be unlawful . . . any aircraft eligible for registration if such aircraft is not registered by its owner as provided in this section, or . . . any aircraft not eligible for registration” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “A person may operate an aircraft in the United States that is not registered” are substituted for “may be operated and navigated without being so registered” and “may . . . permit the operation and navigation of aircraft without registration” for clarity. In clause (2), the words “identified in a way” are substituted for “identified, by the agency having jurisdiction over them, in a manner” to eliminate unnecessary words.

>     Congress finds the following:

>         “(1) The Cape Town Treaty (as defined in [section 44113 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s44113], United States Code) extends modern commercial laws for the sale, finance, and lease of aircraft and aircraft engines to the international arena in a manner consistent with United States law and practice.

>         “(2) The Cape Town Treaty provides for internationally established and recognized financing and leasing rights that will provide greater security and commercial predictability in connection with the financing and leasing of highly mobile assets, such as aircraft and aircraft engines.

>         “(3) The legal and financing framework of the Cape Town Treaty will provide substantial economic benefits to the aviation and aerospace sectors, including the promotion of exports, and will facilitate the acquisition of newer, safer aircraft around the world.

>         “(4) Only technical changes to United States law and regulations are required since the asset-based financing and leasing concepts embodied in the Cape Town Treaty are already reflected in the United States in the Uniform Commercial Code.

>         “(5) The new electronic registry system established under the Cape Town Treaty will work in tandem with current aircraft document recordation systems of the Federal Aviation Administration, which have served United States industry well.
