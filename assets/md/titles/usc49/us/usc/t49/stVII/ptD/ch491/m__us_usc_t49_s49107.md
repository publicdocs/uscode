## § 49107. Federal employees at Metropolitan Washington Airports

    (a)  __Labor Agreements__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority shall adopt all labor agreements that were in effect on June 7, 1987. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the agreements must be renegotiated before June 7, 1992.

        (2) Employee protection arrangements made under this section shall ensure, during the 50-year lease term, the continuation of all collective bargaining rights enjoyed by transferred employees retained by the Airports Authority.

    (b)  __Civil Service Retirement__  __.—__ 

    Any Federal employee who transferred to the Airports Authority and who on June 6, 1987, was subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, is subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 for so long as continually employed by the Airports Authority without a break in service. For purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84, employment by the Airports Authority without a break in continuity of service is deemed to be employment by the United States Government. The Airports Authority is the employing agency for purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84 and shall contribute to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund amounts required by subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84.

    (c)  __Access to Records__  __.—__ 

    The Airports Authority shall allow representatives of the Secretary of Transportation adequate access to employees and employee records of the Airports Authority when needed to carry out a duty or power related to the period before June 7, 1987. The Secretary shall provide the Airports Authority access to employee records of transferring employees for appropriate purposes.
