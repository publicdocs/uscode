## § 44307. Revolving fund

    (a) __Existence, Disbursements, Appropriations, and Deposits.—__ 

        (1) There is a revolving fund in the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall disburse from the fund payments to carry out this chapter.

        (2) Necessary amounts to carry out this chapter may be appropriated to the fund. The amounts appropriated and other amounts received in carrying out this chapter shall be deposited in the fund.

    (b) __Investment.—__ 

    On request of the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the Treasury may invest any part of the amounts in the revolving fund in interest-bearing securities of the United States Government. The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, the securities shall be deposited in the fund.

    (c) __Excess Amounts.—__ 

    The balance in the revolving fund in excess of an amount the Secretary of Transportation determines is necessary for the requirements of the fund and for reasonable reserves to maintain the solvency of the fund shall be deposited at least annually in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

    (d) __Expenses.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall deposit annually an amount in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts to cover the expenses the Government incurs when the Secretary of Transportation uses appropriated amounts in carrying out this chapter. The deposited amount shall equal an amount determined by multiplying the average monthly balance of appropriated amounts retained in the revolving fund by a percentage that is at least the current average rate payable on marketable obligations of the Government. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine annually in advance the percentage applied.

    In subsection (a)(1), the first sentence is added for clarity. The last sentence is substituted for 49 App.:1536(a) (last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “The amounts appropriated and other amounts received in carrying out this chapter” are substituted for “Moneys appropriated by Congress to carry out the provisions of this subchapter and all moneys received from premiums, salvage, or other recoveries and all receipts in connection with this subchapter” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “any part” are substituted for “all or any part” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “held in the revolving fund” are omitted as surplus. The words “deposited in” are substituted for “credited to and form a part of” for consistency.

    In subsection (d), the words “The Secretary of Transportation shall deposit annually an amount in the Treasury” are substituted for “Annual payments shall be made by the Secretary to the Treasury of the United States”, the words “The deposited amount shall equal an amount determined by multiplying” are substituted for “These payments shall be computed by applying to”, and the words “a percentage that is at least the current average rate payable on marketable obligations of the Government” are substituted for “a percentage” and “Such percentage shall not be less than the current average rate which the Treasury pays on its marketable obligations”, for clarity.
