## § 47124. Agreements for State and local operation of airport facilities

    (a)  __Government Relief From Liability__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that an agreement under this subchapter with a qualified entity (as determined by the Secretary), State, or a political subdivision of a State to allow the entity, State, or subdivision to operate an airport facility relieves the United States Government from any liability arising out of, or related to, acts or omissions of employees of the entity, State, or subdivision in operating the airport facility.

    (b)  __Air Traffic Control Contract Program__  __.—__ 

        (1) __Contract tower program.—__ 

            (A)  __Continuation__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall continue the low activity (Visual Flight Rules) level I air traffic control tower contract program established under subsection (a) of this section for towers existing on December 30, 1987, and extend the program to other towers as practicable.

            (B)  __Special rule__  __.—__ 

            If the Secretary determines that a tower already operating under the program continued under this paragraph has a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.0, the airport sponsor or State or local government having jurisdiction over the airport shall not be required to pay the portion of the costs that exceeds the benefit for a period of 18 months after such determination is made.

            (C)  __Use of excess funds__  __.—__ 

            If the Secretary finds that all or part of an amount made available to carry out the program continued under this paragraph is not required during a fiscal year, the Secretary may use, during such fiscal year, the amount not so required to carry out the program established under paragraph (3).

        (2)  __General authority__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary may make a contract with a qualified entity (as determined by the Secretary) or, on a sole source basis, with a State or a political subdivision of a State to allow the entity, State, or subdivision to operate an airport traffic control tower classified as a level I (Visual Flight Rules) tower if the Secretary decides that the entity, State, or subdivision has the capability to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. The contract shall require that the entity, State, or subdivision comply with applicable safety regulations in operating the facility and with applicable competition requirements in making a subcontract to perform work to carry out the contract.

        (3) __Contract air traffic control tower program.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall establish a program to contract for air traffic control services at nonapproach control towers, as defined by the Secretary, that do not qualify for the contract tower program established under subsection (a) and continued under paragraph (1) (in this paragraph referred to as the “Contract Tower Program”).

            (B)  __Program components__  __.—__ 

            In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall—

                (i) utilize for purposes of cost-benefit analyses, current, actual, site-specific data, forecast estimates, or airport master plan data provided by a facility owner or operator and verified by the Secretary; and

                (ii) approve for participation only facilities willing to fund a pro rata share of the operating costs of the air traffic control tower to achieve a 1-to-1 benefit-to-cost ratio using actual site-specific contract tower operating costs in any case in which there is an operating air traffic control tower, as required for eligibility under the Contract Tower Program.

            (C)  __Priority__  __.—__ 

            In selecting facilities to participate in the program, the Secretary shall give priority to the following facilities:

                (i) Air traffic control towers that are participating in the Contract Tower Program but have been notified that they will be terminated from such program because the Secretary has determined that the benefit-to-cost ratio for their continuation in such program is less than 1.0.

                (ii) Air traffic control towers that the Secretary determines have a benefit-to-cost ratio of at least .50.

                (iii) Air traffic control towers of the Federal Aviation Administration that are closed as a result of the air traffic controllers strike in 1981.

                (iv) Air traffic control towers located at airports or points at which an air carrier is receiving compensation under the essential air service program under this chapter.

                (v) Air traffic control towers located at airports that are prepared to assume partial responsibility for maintenance costs.

                (vi) Air traffic control towers located at airports with safety or operational problems related to topography, weather, runway configuration, or mix of aircraft.

                (vii) Air traffic control towers located at an airport at which the community has been operating the tower at its own expense.

            (D)  __Costs exceeding benefits__  __.—__ 

            If the costs of operating an air traffic tower under the program exceed the benefits, the airport sponsor or State or local government having jurisdiction over the airport shall pay the portion of the costs that exceed such benefit, with the maximum allowable local cost share capped at 20 percent.

            (E)  __Funding__  __.—__ 

            Of the amounts appropriated pursuant to section 106(k)(1), not more than $10,350,000 for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015 may be used to carry out this paragraph.

            (F)  __Use of excess funds__  __.—__ 

            If the Secretary finds that all or part of an amount made available under this paragraph is not required during a fiscal year, the Secretary may use, during such fiscal year, the amount not so required to carry out the program continued under paragraph (1).

        (4) __Construction of air traffic control towers.—__ 

            (A)  __Grants__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary may provide grants to a sponsor of—

                (i)
