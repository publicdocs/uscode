## § 47110. Allowable project costs

    (a) __General Authority.—__ 

    Except as provided in [section 47111 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47111], the United States Government may pay or be obligated to pay, from amounts appropriated to carry out this subchapter, a cost incurred in carrying out a project under this subchapter only if the Secretary of Transportation decides the cost is allowable.

    (b) __Allowable Cost Standards.—__ 

    A project cost is allowable—

        (1) if the cost necessarily is incurred in carrying out the project in compliance with the grant agreement made for the project under this subchapter, including any cost a sponsor incurs related to an audit the Secretary requires under section 47121(b) or (d) of this title and any cost of moving a Federal facility impeding the project if the rebuilt facility is of an equivalent size and type;

        (2)

            (A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;

            (B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989, by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatability  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “compatibility”. </sup></sup>  program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements;

            (C)

             if the Government’s share is paid only with amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) or section 47114(d)(3)(A) and if the cost is incurred—

                (i) after September 30, 1996;

                (ii) before a grant agreement is executed for the project; and

                (iii) in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after the grant agreement had been executed; or

            (D)

             if the cost is for airport development and is incurred before execution of the grant agreement, but in the same fiscal year as execution of the grant agreement, and if—

                (i) the cost was incurred before execution of the grant agreement because the airport has a shortened construction season due to climactic conditions in the vicinity of the airport;

                (ii) the cost is in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after execution of the grant agreement, including submission of a complete grant application to the appropriate regional or district office of the Federal Aviation Administration;

                (iii) the sponsor notifies the Secretary before authorizing work to commence on the project;

                (iv) the sponsor has an alternative funding source available to fund the project; and

                (v) the sponsor’s decision to proceed with the project in advance of execution of the grant agreement does not affect the priority assigned to the project by the Secretary for the allocation of discretionary funds;

        (3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;

        (4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted;

        (5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in [section 47108(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47108/b]);

        (6) if the cost is for a project not described in section 47102(3) for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and ground support equipment owned by an airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology, as determined by the Secretary; and

        (7)

         if the cost is incurred on a measure to improve the efficiency of an airport building (such as a measure designed to meet one or more of the criteria for being considered a high-performance green building as set forth under section 401(13) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ([42 U.S.C. 17061(13)][/us/usc/t42/s17061/13])) and—

            (A) the measure is for a project for airport development;

            (B) the measure is for an airport building that is otherwise eligible for construction assistance under this subchapter; and

            (C) if the measure results in an increase in initial project costs, the increase is justified by expected savings over the life cycle of the project.

    (c) __Certain Prior Costs as Allowable Costs.—__ 

    The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is—

        (1) necessarily incurred in formulating an airport development project, including costs incurred for field surveys, plans and specifications, property interests in land or airspace, and administration or other incidental items that would not have been incurred except for the project; or

        (2) necessarily and directly incurred in developing the work scope of an airport planning project.

    (d) __Relocation of Airport-Owned Facilities.—__ 

    The Secretary may determine that the costs of relocating or replacing an airport-owned facility are allowable for an airport development project at an airport only if—

        (1) the Government’s share of such costs will be paid with funds apportioned to the airport sponsor under section 47114(c)(1) or 47114(d);

        (2) the Secretary determines that the relocation or replacement is required due to a change in the Secretary’s design standards; and

        (3) the Secretary determines that the change is beyond the control of the airport sponsor.

    (e) __Letters of Intent.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government’s share of allowable project costs, for an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government’s share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.

        (2)

         Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project—

            (A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor’s intent to carry out the project;

            (B) that will comply with all statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if it were carried out with amounts made available under this subchapter; and

            (C) that meets the criteria of section 47115(d) and, if for a project at a commercial service airport having at least 0.25 percent of the boardings each year at all such airports, the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly.

        (3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under [section 1501 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1501], and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.

        (4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out [section 48103 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s48103], less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.

        (5) __Letters of intent.—__ 

        The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility charge under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.

        (6) __Limitation on statutory construction.—__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.

    (f) __Nonallowable Costs.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and [section 47118(f) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47118/f], a cost is not an allowable airport development project cost if it is for—

        (1) constructing a public parking facility for passenger automobiles;

        (2) constructing, altering, or repairing part of an airport building, except to the extent the building will be used for facilities or activities directly related to the safety of individuals at the airport;

        (3) decorative landscaping; or

        (4) providing or installing sculpture or art works.

    (g) __Use of Discretionary Funds.—__ 

    A project for which cost reimbursement is provided under subsection (b)(2)(C) shall not receive priority consideration with respect to the use of discretionary funds made available under [section 47115 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47115] even if the amounts made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) or section 47114(d)(3)(A) are not sufficient to cover the Government’s share of the cost of the project.

    (h) __Nonprimary Airports.—__ 

    The Secretary may decide that the construction costs of revenue producing aeronautical support facilities are allowable for an airport development project at a nonprimary airport if the Government’s share of such costs is paid only with funds apportioned to the airport sponsor under section 47114(d)(3)(A) and if the Secretary determines that the sponsor has made adequate provision for financing airside needs of the airport.

    (i) __Bird-Detecting Radar Systems.—__ 

    The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, upon the conclusion of all planned research by the Administration regarding avian radar systems, shall—

        (1) update Advisory Circular No. 150/5220–25 to specify which systems have been studied; and

        (2) within 180 days after such research is concluded, issue a final report on the use of avian radar systems in the national airspace system.

The words “incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed” are substituted for “which were incurred prior to the execution of the grant agreement and subsequent to May 13, 1946” and “which were incurred subsequent to May 13, 1946” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words “preparation of”, “acquisition of”, “by the sponsor specifically in connection with the accomplishment of the project for airport development” are omitted as surplus. The words “property interests in land or airspace” are substituted for “land or interests therein or easements through or other interests in airspace” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (d)(1), before clause (A), the words “The Secretary may decide that the cost . . . is allowable” are substituted for “the Secretary may approve, as allowable project costs” and “The Secretary shall approve project costs allowable under paragraph (1) of this subsection” for clarity and consistency in this section. In clause (B), the words “the boundaries of” are omitted as surplus. In clause (C), the words “and conditions” are omitted as being included in “terms”.

    In subsection (d)(2), the words “In making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may approve as allowable costs” are substituted for “In the case of a commercial service airport . . . the Secretary may approve, under the preceding sentence as allowable project costs” for consistency in this subsection.

    In subsection (e)(1), the word “sponsor” is substituted for “applicant” for consistency. The words “stipulated as” and “Subject to the provisions of this paragraph” are omitted as surplus. The word “reimburse” is substituted for “make payments under paragraph (2) of this subsection” and “pay” for clarity. The words “payable on account of such project in accordance with such letter of intent” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (e)(2), before clause (A), the text of 49 App.:2212(d)(1)(C) (last sentence) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (e)(3), the words “A letter of intent issued” are substituted for “action” for clarity. The word “deemed” before “an obligation” is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (f)(2), the words “of a hangar or” are omitted as being included in “airport building”.

>     “(a) The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may issue a letter of intent to an airport committing to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Federal Government’s share of the project’s cost, for an airport security improvement project (including interest costs and costs of formulating the project) at the airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Under Secretary will reimburse the airport for the Government’s share of the project’s costs, as amounts become available, if the airport, after the Under Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under Chapter 471 of title 49 \[United States Code\].

>     “(b) The airport shall notify the Under Secretary of the airport’s intent to carry out the airport security improvement project before the project begins.

>     “(c)

>      A letter of intent may be issued under this section only if—

>         “(1) The airport security improvement project to which the letter applies involves the replacement of baggage conveyer systems or the reconfiguration of terminal baggage areas in order to install explosive detection systems; and

>         “(2) The Under Secretary determines that the project will improve security or will improve the efficiency of the airport without lessening security.

>     “(d) A letter of intent issued under this section is not an obligation of the Government under [section 1501 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1501] \[United States Code\], and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriations laws.

>     “(e) The Government’s share of the project’s cost shall be 75 percent for a project at an airport having at least 0.25 percent of the total number of passenger boardings each year at all airports and 90 percent for a project at any other airport.

>     “(f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this section in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.

>     “(g) The Under Secretary shall notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee at least 3 days prior to the issuance of a letter of intent under this section.

>     “(h) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $500,000,000 in each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.”
