    The word “prescribed” is substituted for “issued” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “if such violation is committed in any area under the civil jurisdiction of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “a fine of not more than $500”, and the words “be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted, for consistency with title 18.
