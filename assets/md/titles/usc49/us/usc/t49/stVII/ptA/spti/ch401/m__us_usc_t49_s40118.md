        (1)

         the department, agency, or instrumentality—

            (A) obtains the transportation for itself or in carrying out an arrangement under which payment is made by the Government or payment is made from amounts provided for the use of the Government; or

            (B) reasonably available, if the transportation is between 2 places outside the United States.

    (b)  __Transportation by Foreign Air Carriers__  __.—__ 

    This section does not preclude the transportation of passengers and property by a foreign air carrier if the transportation is provided under a bilateral or multilateral air transportation agreement to which the Government and the government of a foreign country are parties if the agreement—

        (1) is consistent with the goals for international aviation policy of [section 40101(e) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s40101/e]; and

    (d)  __Certain Transportation by Air Outside the United States__  __.—__ 

    Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, any amount appropriated to the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the Agency for International Development may be used to pay for the transportation of an officer or employee of the Department of State or one of those agencies, a dependent of the officer or employee, and accompanying baggage, by a foreign air carrier when the transportation is between 2 places outside the United States.

    (e)  __Relationship to Other Laws__  __.—__
