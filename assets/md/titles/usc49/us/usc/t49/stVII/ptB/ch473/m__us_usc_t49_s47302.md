    In this chapter, the words “government of a foreign country” are substituted for “foreign government” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In this section, the title “Secretary of Commerce” is substituted for “Chief of the Weather Bureau of the Department of Commerce” in section 3, and “Chief of the Weather Bureau” in section 5, of the International Aviation Facilities Act (ch. 473, [62 Stat. 451][/us/stat/62/451]) because of sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (eff. July 13, 1965, [79 Stat. 1318][/us/stat/79/1318]).

    In subsection (a), the words “by contract or otherwise” are omitted as surplus. The words “airport property and airway property (except meteorological facilities)” and “meteorological facilities” are substituted for “within their respective fields” for clarity.

    In subsection (b), the words “for the airport” are substituted for “for such purpose” for clarity. The words “by the Congress” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the words “on behalf of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The words “sold or provided” are substituted for “supplied or . . . performed” for consistency in this chapter. The words “by the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of Commerce, either directly or indirectly” and “the authority of” are omitted as surplus. The words “or the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended” are omitted as obsolete because the Act was repealed by section 1401(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 806][/us/stat/72/806]). The words “including the operation of airport property and airway property in such countries, the training of foreign nationals, the rendering of technical assistance and advice to such countries, and the performance of other similar services” are omitted as being included in “facilities or services sold or provided”. The words “or both” are substituted for “or (C) in part as provided under clause (A) and in part as provided under clause (B)” to eliminate unnecessary words.
