The Secretary of Transportation may make an agreement with an airport owner or sponsor (as defined in [section 47102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47102]) so that the owner or sponsor will provide the work and be paid or reimbursed by the Secretary from the appropriated amounts.

        (3) The Secretary of Transportation may authorize a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government to carry out any duty or power under this subsection with the consent of the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality.

        (4) __Purchase of instrument landing system.—__ 

            (A)  __Establishment of program__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall purchase precision approach instrument landing system equipment for installation at airports on an expedited basis.

            (B)  __Authorization__  __.—__ 

            No less than $30,000,000 of the amounts appropriated under section 48101(a) for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2002 shall be used for the purpose of carrying out this paragraph, including acquisition under new or existing contracts, site preparation work, installation, and related expenditures.

        (5)  __Improvements on leased properties__  __.—__ 

        The Administrator may make improvements to real property leased for no or nominal consideration for an air navigation facility, regardless of whether the cost of making the improvements exceeds the cost of leasing the real property, if—

            (A) the improvements primarily benefit the Government;

            (B) the improvements are essential for accomplishment of the mission of the Federal Aviation Administration; and

            (C) the interest of the United States Government in the improvements is protected.

    (b)  __Certification of Necessity__  __.—__ 

    Except for Government money expended under this part or for a military purpose, Government money may be expended to acquire, establish, construct, operate, repair, alter, or maintain an air navigation facility only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration certifies in writing that the facility is reasonably necessary for use in air commerce or for the national defense. An interested person may apply for a certificate for a facility to be acquired, established, constructed, operated, repaired, altered, or maintained by or for the person.

    (c)  __Ensuring Conformity With Plans and Policies__  __.—__ 

        (1) To ensure conformity with plans and policies for, and allocation of, airspace by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under [section 40103(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s40103/b/1], a military airport, military landing area, or missile or rocket site may be acquired, established, or constructed, or a runway may be altered substantially, only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is given reasonable prior notice so that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may advise the appropriate committees of Congress and interested departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government on the effect of the acquisition, establishment, construction, or alteration on the use of airspace by aircraft. A disagreement between the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of Defense or the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may be appealed to the President for a final decision.

        (2) To ensure conformity, an airport or landing area not involving the expenditure of Government money may be established or constructed, or a runway may be altered substantially, only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is given reasonable prior notice so that the Administrator may provide advice on the effects of the establishment, construction, or alteration on the use of airspace by aircraft.

    (d)  __Public Use and Emergency Assistance__  __.—__ 

        (1) The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government having jurisdiction over an air navigation facility owned or operated by the Government may provide, under regulations the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality prescribes, for public use of the facility.

        (2) The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government having jurisdiction over an airport or emergency landing field owned or operated by the Government may provide, under regulations the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality prescribes, for assistance, and the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies, to an aircraft, but only when necessary, because of an emergency, to allow the aircraft to continue to the nearest airport operated by private enterprise. The head of the department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide for the assistance and sale at the prevailing local fair market value as determined by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality. An amount that the head decides is equal to the cost of the assistance provided and the fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies sold shall be credited to the appropriation from which the cost was paid. The balance shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.

    (e)  __Transfers of Instrument Landing Systems__  __.—__ 

    An airport may transfer, without consideration, to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration an instrument landing system (and associated approach lighting equipment and runway visual range equipment) that conforms to performance specifications of the Administrator if a Government airport aid program, airport development aid program, or airport improvement project grant was used to assist in purchasing the system. The Administrator shall accept the system and operate and maintain it under criteria of the Administrator.

>     “(b) __Computation Rules.—__ 

>         “(1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

>         The amount of each quarterly retention allowance payment to which an employee is entitled under subsection (a) shall be the amount of the last quarterly retention allowance payment paid to such employee under the personnel demonstration project prior to June 17, 1994, reduced by that portion of the amount of any increase in the employee’s annual rate of basic pay subsequent to June 17, 1994, from any source, which is allocable to the quarter for which the allowance is to be paid (or, if applicable, to that portion of the quarter for which the allowance is to be paid).

>         “(2)  __Section rule__  __.—__ 

>         In the case of an employee on leave without pay or other similar status for any part of the quarter prior to June 17, 1994, based on which the amount of the allowance payments for such employee under subsection (a) are computed, the ‘amount of the last quarterly retention allowance payment paid to such employee under the personnel demonstration project prior to June 17, 1994’ shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be deemed to be the amount of the allowance which would have been payable to such employee for such quarter under such project had such employee been in pay status throughout such quarter.

>     “(c)  __Termination__  __.—__ 

>     An employee’s entitlement to quarterly retention allowance payments under this section shall cease when—

>         “(1) the amount of such allowance is reduced to zero under subsection (b), or

>         “(2) the employee separates or moves to a position in which the employee would not, prior to June 17, 1994, have been entitled to receive an allowance under the demonstration project,

>         whichever is earlier.

>     “(d)  __Special Payment Rule__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make payment for the costs incurred under the program established by subsection (a) for the period between June 18, 1994, and September 30, 1994, following the end of the first full pay period that begins on or after October 1, 1994, subject to appropriations made available in fiscal year 1995.

>     “(e)  __Study of Recruitment and Retention Incentives__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall conduct a study of impediments that may exist to achieving appropriate air traffic controller staffing levels at hard-to-staff facilities. In conducting such study, the Administrator shall identify and evaluate the extent to which special incentives, of a financial or non-financial nature, could be useful in recruiting or retaining air traffic controllers at such facilities. The Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \[May 26, 1994\] a report on (1) the results of such study, (2) planned administrative actions, and (3) any recommended legislation.”
