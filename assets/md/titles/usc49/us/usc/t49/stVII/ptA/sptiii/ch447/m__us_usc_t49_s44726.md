## § 44726. Denial and revocation of certificate for counterfeit parts violations

    (a) __Denial of Certificate.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (e)(2), the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may not issue a certificate under this chapter to any person—

            (A) convicted in a court of law of a violation of a law of the United States relating to the installation, production, repair, or sale of a counterfeit or fraudulently-represented aviation part or material;

            (B) whose certificate is revoked under subsection (b); or

            (C) subject to a controlling or ownership interest of an individual described in subparagraph (A) or (B).

        (2) __Exception.—__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Administrator may issue a certificate under this chapter to a person described in paragraph (1) if issuance of the certificate will facilitate law enforcement efforts.

    (b) __Revocation of Certificate.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g), the Administrator shall issue an order revoking a certificate issued under this chapter if the Administrator finds that the holder of the certificate or an individual who has a controlling or ownership interest in the holder—

            (A) was convicted in a court of law of a violation of a law of the United States relating to the installation, production, repair, or sale of a counterfeit or fraudulently-represented aviation part or material; or

            (B) knowingly, and with the intent to defraud, carried out or facilitated an activity punishable under a law described in paragraph (1)(A).

        (2) __No authority to review violation.—__ 

        In carrying out paragraph (1), the Administrator may not review whether a person violated a law described in paragraph (1)(A).

    (c) __Notice Requirement.—__ 

    Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b), the Administrator shall—

        (1) advise the holder of the certificate of the reason for the revocation; and

        (2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to be heard on why the certificate should not be revoked.

    (d) __Appeal.—__ 

    The provisions of section 44710(d) apply to the appeal of a revocation order under subsection (b). For the purpose of applying that section to the appeal, “person” shall be substituted for “individual” each place it appears.

    (e) __Acquittal or Reversal.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        The Administrator may not revoke, and the National Transportation Safety Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate under subsection (b)(1)(B) if the holder of the certificate or the individual referred to in subsection (b)(1) is acquitted of all charges directly related to the violation.

        (2) __Reissuance.—__ 

        The Administrator may reissue a certificate revoked under subsection (b) of this section to the former holder if—

            (A) the former holder otherwise satisfies the requirements of this chapter for the certificate; and

            (B)

                (i) the former holder or the individual referred to in subsection (b)(1), is acquitted of all charges related to the violation on which the revocation was based; or

                (ii) the conviction of the former holder or such individual of the violation on which the revocation was based is reversed.

    (f) __Waiver.—__ 

    The Administrator may waive revocation of a certificate under subsection (b) if—

        (1) a law enforcement official of the United States Government requests a waiver; and

        (2) the waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts.

    (g) __Amendment of Certificate.—__ 

    If the holder of a certificate issued under this chapter is other than an individual and the Administrator finds that—

        (1) an individual who had a controlling or ownership interest in the holder committed a violation of a law for the violation of which a certificate may be revoked under this section or knowingly, and with intent to defraud, carried out or facilitated an activity punishable under such a law; and

        (2) the holder satisfies the requirements for the certificate without regard to that individual,

        then the Administrator may amend the certificate to impose a limitation that the certificate will not be valid if that individual has a controlling or ownership interest in the holder. A decision by the Administrator under this subsection is not reviewable by the Board.
