        (1) the disclosure of the information would inhibit the voluntary provision of that type of information and that the receipt of that type of information aids in fulfilling the Administrator’s safety and security responsibilities; and

        (2) withholding such information from disclosure would be consistent with the Administrator’s safety and security responsibilities.

    (b)  __Regulations__  __.—__
