## § 41718. Special rules for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport

    (a)  __Beyond-Perimeter Exemptions__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall grant, by order, 24 exemptions from the application of sections 49104(a)(5), 49109, 49111(e), and 41714 of this title to air carriers to operate limited frequencies and aircraft on select routes between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and domestic hub airports and exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93, Code of Federal Regulations, if the Secretary finds that the exemptions will—

        (1) provide air transportation with domestic network benefits in areas beyond the perimeter described in that section;

        (2) increase competition by new entrant air carriers or in multiple markets;

        (3) not reduce travel options for communities served by small hub airports and medium hub airports within the perimeter described in section 49109; and

        (4) not result in meaningfully increased travel delays.

    (b)  __Within-Perimeter Exemptions__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall grant, by order, 20 exemptions from the requirements of sections 49104(a)(5), 49111(e), and 41714 of this title and subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, to air carriers for providing air transportation to airports within the perimeter established for civil aircraft operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport under section 49109. The Secretary shall develop criteria for distributing slot exemptions for flights within the perimeter to such airports under this paragraph in a manner that promotes air transportation—

        (1) by new entrant air carriers and limited incumbent air carriers;

        (2) to communities without existing nonstop air transportation to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport;

        (3) to small communities;

        (4) that will provide competitive nonstop air transportation on a monopoly nonstop route to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; or

        (5) that will produce the maximum competitive benefits, including low fares.

    (c) __Limitations.—__ 

        (1)  __Stage 3 aircraft required__  __.—__ 

        An exemption may not be granted under this section with respect to any aircraft that is not a Stage 3 aircraft (as defined by the Secretary).

            (B)  __Use of existing slots__  __.—__ 

            A non-limited incumbent air carrier utilizing an exemption authorized under subsection (g)(3) for an arrival permitted between the hours of 10:01 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. under this section shall discontinue use of an existing slot during the same time period the arrival exemption is operated.

        (3)  __Allocation of within-perimeter exemptions__  __.—__ 

        Of the exemptions granted under subsection (b)—

            (A) without regard to the criteria contained in subsection (b)(1), six shall be for air transportation to small hub airports and nonhub airports;

            (C) four shall be for air transportation to airports without regard to their size.

        (4)  __Applicability to exemption no. 5133__  __.—__ 

        Nothing in this section affects Exemption No. 5133, as from time-to-time amended and extended.

    (d)  __Application Procedures__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall establish procedures to ensure that all requests for exemptions under this section are granted or denied within 90 days after the date on which the request is made.

    (e)  __Applicability of Certain Laws__  __.—__ 

    Neither the request for, nor the granting of an exemption, under this section shall be considered for purposes of any Federal law a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

            (A) the application of sections 49104(a)(5), 49109, and 41714 to air carriers to operate limited frequencies and aircraft on routes between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and airports located beyond the perimeter described in section 49109; and

        Of the slot exemptions made available under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make 8 available to incumbent air carriers qualifying for status as a non-limited incumbent carrier at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport as of the date of enactment of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Each such non-limited incumbent air carrier—

            (A) may operate up to a maximum of 2 of the newly authorized slot exemptions;

            (B) prior to exercising an exemption made available under paragraph (1), shall discontinue the use of a slot for service between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and a large hub airport within the perimeter as described in section 49109, and operate, in place of such service, service between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and an airport located beyond the perimeter described in section 49109;

            (C) shall be entitled to return of the slot by the Secretary if use of the exemption made available to the carrier under paragraph (1) is discontinued;

            (A) An air carrier may not operate a multi-aisle or widebody aircraft in conducting such operations.

    (h)  __Scheduling Priority__  __.—__ 

    In administering this section, the Secretary shall—

        (1) afford a scheduling priority to operations conducted by new entrant air carriers and limited incumbent air carriers over operations conducted by other air carriers granted additional slot exemptions under subsection (g) for service to airports located beyond the perimeter described in section 49109;

        (2) afford a scheduling priority to slot exemptions currently held by new entrant air carriers and limited incumbent air carriers for service to airports located beyond the perimeter described in section 49109, to the extent necessary to protect viability of such service; and

        (3) consider applications from foreign air carriers that are certificated by the government of Canada if such consideration is required by the bilateral aviation agreement between the United States and Canada and so long as the conditions and limitations under this section apply to such foreign air carriers.
