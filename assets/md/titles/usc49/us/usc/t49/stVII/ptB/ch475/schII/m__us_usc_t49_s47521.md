## § 47521. Findings

Congress finds that—

    (1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;

    (2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;

    (3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;

    (4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;

    (5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility charges, for noise management;

    (6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;

    (7) revenues derived from a passenger facility charge may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and

    (8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility charge is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.
