## § 44103. Registration of aircraft

    (a)  __General__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         On application of the owner of an aircraft that meets the requirements of [section 44102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44102], the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall—

            (A) register the aircraft; and

            (B) issue a certificate of registration to its owner.

        (2) The Administrator may prescribe the extent to which an aircraft owned by the holder of a dealer’s certificate of registration issued under [section 44104(2) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44104/2] also is registered under this section.

    (b)  __Controlled Substance Violations__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         The Administrator may not issue an owner’s certificate of registration under subsection (a)(1) of this section to a person whose certificate is revoked under [section 44106 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44106] during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the revocation, except—

            (A) as provided in [section 44106(e)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44106/e/2]; or

            (B)

             that the Administrator may issue the certificate to the person after the one-year period beginning on the date of the revocation if the Administrator decides that the aircraft otherwise meets the requirements of [section 44102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44102] and that denial of a certificate for the 5-year period—

                (i) would be excessive considering the nature of the offense or the act committed and the burden the denial places on the person; or

                (ii) would not be in the public interest.

        (2) A decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(B)(i) or (ii) of this subsection is within the discretion of the Administrator. That decision or failure to make a decision is not subject to administrative or judicial review.

    (c)  __Certificates as Evidence__  __.—__ 

    A certificate of registration issued under this section is—

        (1) conclusive evidence of the nationality of an aircraft for international purposes, but not conclusive evidence in a proceeding under the laws of the United States; and

        (2) not evidence of ownership of an aircraft in a proceeding in which ownership is or may be in issue.

    (d)  __Certificates Available for Inspection__  __.—__ 

    An operator of an aircraft shall make available for inspection a certificate of registration for the aircraft when requested by a United States Government, State, or local law enforcement officer.

    In subsection (a)(1), the words “On application” are substituted for “upon request”, and the words “meets the requirements of [section 44102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44102]” are substituted for “eligible for registration”, for consistency in this subchapter. The text of 49 App.:1401(d) is omitted as unnecessary because of 49:322(a).

    In subsection (b)(1)(B), before subclause (i), the words “after the one-year period beginning on the date of the revocation” are substituted for “before the end of such five-year period (but not before the end of the one-year period beginning on the date of such revocation)” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “otherwise meets the requirements of [section 44102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44102]” are substituted for “is otherwise eligible for registration under this section” because of the restatement. The words “denial of a certificate” are substituted for “revocation of the certificate” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “A certificate of registration” are substituted for “Registration” for clarity. In clause (2), the words “by a particular person” are omitted as surplus.

 __Aircraft Situational Display Data__ 

[Pub. L. 106–181, title VII, § 729][/us/pl/106/181/s729], Apr. 5, 2000, [114 Stat. 168][/us/stat/114/168], provided that:

>     “(a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

>     A memorandum of agreement between the Administrator \[of the Federal Aviation Administration\] and any person that directly obtains aircraft situational display data from the Federal Aviation Administration shall require that—

>         “(1) the person demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the person is capable of selectively blocking the display of any aircraft-situation-display-to-industry derived data related to any identified aircraft registration number; and

>         “(2) the person agree to block selectively the aircraft registration numbers of any aircraft owner or operator upon the Administration’s request.

>     “(b)  __Existing Memoranda To Be Conformed__  __.—__ 

>     Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Apr. 5, 2000\], the Administrator shall conform any memoranda of agreement, in effect on such date of enactment, between the Federal Aviation Administration and a person under which that person obtains aircraft situational display data to incorporate the requirements of subsection (a).”
