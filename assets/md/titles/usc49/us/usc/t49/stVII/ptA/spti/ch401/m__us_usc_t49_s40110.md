        (1)  __Authority__  __.—__ 

        In carrying out this part, the Administrator may purchase a housing unit (including a condominium or a housing unit in a building owned by a cooperative) that is located outside the contiguous United States if the cost of the unit is $300,000 or less.

        (2)  __Adjustments for inflation__  __.—__ 

        For fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1997, the Administrator may adjust the dollar amount specified in paragraph (1) to take into account increases in local housing costs.

        (3)  __Continuing obligations__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding [section 1341 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1341], the Administrator may purchase a housing unit under paragraph (1) even if there is an obligation thereafter to pay necessary and reasonable fees duly assessed upon such unit, including fees related to operation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.

        (4)  __Certification to congress__  __.—__ 

        The Administrator may purchase a housing unit under paragraph (1) only if, at least 30 days before completing the purchase, the Administrator transmits to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing—

            (A) a description of the housing unit and its price;

            (B) a certification that the price does not exceed the median price of housing units in the area; and

        (5)  __Payment of fees__  __.—__ 

        The Administrator may pay, when due, fees resulting from the purchase of a housing unit under this subsection from any amounts made available to the Administrator.

        (2) consider the reasonable probable future use of the underlying land in making an award for a condemnation of an interest in airspace;

        (3) construct, or acquire an interest in, a public building (as defined in [section 3301(a) of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s3301/a]) only under a delegation of authority from the Administrator of General Services; and

    (d) __Acquisition Management System.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        In consultation with such non-governmental experts in acquisition management systems as the Administrator may employ, and notwithstanding provisions of Federal acquisition law, the Administrator shall develop and implement an acquisition management system for the Administration that addresses the unique needs of the agency and, at a minimum, provides for—

            (A) more timely and cost-effective acquisitions of equipment, services, property, and materials; and

However, [section 4705 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s4705] shall apply to the new acquisition management system developed and implemented pursuant to paragraph (1). For the purpose of applying [section 4705 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s4705] to the system, the term “executive agency” is deemed to refer to the Federal Aviation Administration.

            (D) The Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 631][/us/usc/t15/s631] et seq.), except that all reasonable opportunities to be awarded contracts shall be provided to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

        (3)  __Certain provisions of division b (except sections 1704 and 2303) of subtitle i of title 41__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B), chapter 21 of title 41 shall apply to the new acquisition management system developed and implemented under paragraph (1) with the following modifications:

            (B) Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, the Administrator shall adopt definitions for the acquisition management system that are consistent with the purpose and intent of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

            (C) After the adoption of those definitions, the criminal, civil, and administrative remedies provided under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act 1 apply to the acquisition management system.

            (D) In the administration of the acquisition management system, the Administrator may take adverse personnel action under section 27(e)(3)(A)(iv) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act 1 in accordance with the procedures contained in the Administration’s personnel management system.

        (4)  __Adjudication of certain bid protests and contract disputes__  __.—__ 

        A bid protest or contract dispute that is not addressed or resolved through alternative dispute resolution shall be adjudicated by the Administrator through Dispute Resolution Officers or Special Masters of the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Dispute Resolution for Acquisition, acting pursuant to sections 46102, 46104, 46105, 46106 and 46107 and shall be subject to judicial review under section 46110 and to [section 504 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s504].

    (e) __Prohibition on Release of Offeror Proposals.—__ 

        (1)  __General rule__  __.—__

        (2)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any portion of a proposal of an offeror the disclosure of which is authorized by the Administrator pursuant to procedures published in the Federal Register. The Administrator shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the procedures for a period of not less than 30 days beginning on the date of such publication in order to receive and consider the views of all interested parties on the procedures. The procedures shall not take effect before the 60th day following the date of such publication.

        (3)  __Proposal defined__  __.—__ 

        In this subsection, the term “proposal” means information contained in or originating from any proposal, including a technical, management, or cost proposal, submitted by an offeror in response to the requirements of a solicitation for a competitive proposal.

In this section, the word “Administrator” in section 303(a)–(d) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 747][/us/stat/72/747]) is retained on authority of 49:106(g).

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “In carrying out this part” are added for clarity. The words “on behalf of the United States . . . where appropriate” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “made by the Congress”, “by purchase, condemnation . . . or otherwise”, and “easements through or other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “by sale, lease, or otherwise” and “real or personal” are omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the word “renovate” is omitted as surplus. The words “and to purchase or otherwise acquire real property required therefor” are omitted as surplus because of the authority of the Administrator to acquire real property under clause (1) of this subsection.

    In subsection (b)(1), the words “procedures other than competitive procedures” are substituted for “noncompetitive procedures” for consistency with subsection (b)(2)(D) of this section and 41:253(f).

    In subsection (b)(2)(B), the text of 49 App.:1344(b)(1) (words before semicolon) and the words “easements through or other” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b)(2)(C), the words “by purchase, condemnation, or lease” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (b)(2)(E) is substituted for 49 App.:1344(g) to eliminate the cross-references to other laws and for clarity and is based on the text of 10:2304(c)(1).
