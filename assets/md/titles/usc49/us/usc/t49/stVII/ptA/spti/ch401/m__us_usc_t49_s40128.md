## § 40128. Overflights of national parks

    (a) __In General.—__ 

        (1)  __General requirements__  __.—__ 

        A commercial air tour operator may not conduct commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, as defined by this section, except—

            (A) in accordance with this section;

            (B) in accordance with conditions and limitations prescribed for that operator by the Administrator; and

            (C) in accordance with any applicable air tour management plan or voluntary agreement under subsection (b)(7) for the park or tribal lands.

        (2) __Application for operating authority.—__ 

            (A)  __Application required__  __.—__ 

            Before commencing commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, a commercial air tour operator shall apply to the Administrator for authority to conduct the operations over the park or tribal lands.

            (B)  __Competitive bidding for limited capacity parks__  __.—__ 

            Whenever an air tour management plan limits the number of commercial air tour operations over a national park during a specified time frame, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall issue operation specifications to commercial air tour operators that conduct such operations. The operation specifications shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator and the Director find necessary for management of commercial air tour operations over the park. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an open competitive process for evaluating proposals from persons interested in providing commercial air tour operations over the park. In making a selection from among various proposals submitted, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall consider relevant factors, including—

                (i) the safety record of the person submitting the proposal or pilots employed by the person;

                (ii) any quiet aircraft technology proposed to be used by the person submitting the proposal;

                (iii) the experience of the person submitting the proposal with commercial air tour operations over other national parks or scenic areas;

                (iv) the financial capability of the person submitting the proposal;

                (v) any training programs for pilots provided by the person submitting the proposal; and

                (vi) responsiveness of the person submitting the proposal to any relevant criteria developed by the National Park Service for the affected park.

            (C)  __Number of operations authorized__  __.—__ 

            In determining the number of authorizations to issue to provide commercial air tour operations over a national park, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall take into consideration the provisions of the air tour management plan, the number of existing commercial air tour operators and current level of service and equipment provided by any such operators, and the financial viability of each commercial air tour operation.

            (D)  __Cooperation with nps__  __.—__ 

            Before granting an application under this paragraph, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an air tour management plan in accordance with subsection (b) and implement such plan.

            The Administrator shall make every effort to act on any application under this paragraph and issue a decision on the application not later than 24 months after it is received or amended.

            (F)  __Priority__  __.—__ 

            In acting on applications under this paragraph to provide commercial air tour operations over a national park, the Administrator shall give priority to an application under this paragraph in any case in which a new entrant commercial air tour operator is seeking operating authority with respect to that national park.

        (3)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), commercial air tour operators may conduct commercial air tour operations over a national park under part 91 of the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

A new entrant commercial air tour operator shall apply for such authority before conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands. The Administrator shall make every effort to act on any such application for a new entrant and issue a decision on the application not later than 24 months after it is received or amended.

        (5) __Exemption for national parks with 50 or fewer flights each year.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a national park that has 50 or fewer commercial air tour operations over the park each year shall be exempt from the requirements of this section, except as provided in subparagraph (B).

            (B)  __Withdrawal of exemption__  __.—__

The air tour management plan shall be developed by means of a public process in accordance with paragraph (4).

            (B)  __Objective__  __.—__ 

            The objective of any air tour management plan shall be to develop acceptable and effective measures to mitigate or prevent the significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air tour operations upon the natural and cultural resources, visitor experiences, and tribal lands.

            (C)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

            An application to begin or expand commercial air tour operations at Crater Lake National Park or Great Smoky Mountains National Park may be denied without the establishment of an air tour management plan by the Director of the National Park Service if the Director determines that such operations would adversely affect park resources or visitor experiences.
