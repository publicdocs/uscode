In subsection (a), the words “International Navigational Rules Act of 1977 ([33 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t33/s1601] et seq.)” are substituted for “sections 143 to 147d of title 33” because those sections were repealed by [section 3 of the Act of September 24, 1963][/us/act/1963-09-24/s3] ([Public Law 88–131][/us/pl/88/131], [77 Stat. 194][/us/stat/77/194]), and replaced by 33:ch. 21. Chapter 21 was repealed by section 10 of the International Navigational Rules Act of 1977 ([Public Law 95–75][/us/pl/95/75], [91 Stat. 311][/us/stat/91/311]) and replaced by 33:1601–1608. The words “including any definition of ‘vessel’ or ‘vehicle’ found therein” and “be construed to” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “to the extent”, “of time”, and “any areas of land or water” are omitted as surplus. The words “and the overlying airspace thereof” are omitted as being included in “outside the United States”. In clause (1), the words “treaty, agreement or other lawful” and “necessary legal” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (c) is substituted for 49 App.:1506 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
