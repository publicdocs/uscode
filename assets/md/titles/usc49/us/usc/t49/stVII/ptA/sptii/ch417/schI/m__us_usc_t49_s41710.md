In this section, before clause (1), the words “matter requiring action of the Secretary” are substituted for “application or other written document” for clarity. The reference to 49 App.:1378 and 1379 is omitted as obsolete because under 49 App.:1551(a)(7), those sections ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1989. The words “on or after the one-hundred-eightieth day after October 24, 1978” are omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the words “order or” are omitted as surplus.
