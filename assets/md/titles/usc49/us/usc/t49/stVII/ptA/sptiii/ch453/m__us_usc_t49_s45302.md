    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the text of 49 App.:1354(f)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the final regulations are effective. The word “impose” is substituted for “establish and collect” for consistency.

    In subsection (d), the words “Money collected from fees imposed” are substituted for “The amount of fees collected” for clarity and consistency.

 __[__  __Pub. L. 103–429__  __][/us/pl/103/429]__ 

    This amends 49:45302 because the final regulations are not yet effective.
