In subsection (a), the word “prescribed” is added for consistency in the revised title. The words “condition, or limitation of” are omitted as surplus. The word “Administrator” in section 902(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 784][/us/stat/72/784]) is retained on authority of 49:106(g). The words “or in section 1474 of this Appendix” are omitted as surplus because 49 App.:1474 is not included in the revised title. The words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted for consistency with title 18. The words “and upon conviction thereof” are omitted as surplus. The words “shall be fined under title 18” are substituted for “shall be subject for the first offense to a fine of not more than $500, and for any subsequent offense to a fine of not more than $2,000” for consistency with title 18.

    In subsection (b), reference to 49 App.:ch. 20, subch. VII is omitted as unnecessary because subchapter VII is not restated in this part.
