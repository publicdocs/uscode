In this section, before clause (1), the words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “a fine of not exceeding $5,000” for consistency with title 18. The words “such fine and imprisonment” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “used at” are substituted for “in connection with” for clarity. The words “airport or other” are omitted as being included in the definition of “air navigation facility” in section 40102(a) of the revised title. In clause (2), the word “due” is omitted as surplus. The word “Administrator” in section 902(c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 784][/us/stat/72/784]) is retained on authority of 49:106(g). In clause (3), the words “removes, extinguishes, or” are omitted as surplus.
