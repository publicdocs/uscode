    In subsection (a), the words “properly” and “currently” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), the word “providing” is substituted for “engaged in” for consistency in the revised title. In clause (1), the words “48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia” are substituted for “the continental United States (not including Alaska)” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. In clause (2), the words “overseas or” are omitted as obsolete. The word “only” is substituted for “wholly” for consistency. In clause (3), the words “as long as it holds” are substituted for “upon the holding” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “under subsection (b)(1) of this section” are substituted for “said decision 83 . . . engaged in interstate air transportation within the continental United States (not including Alaska)” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (d), the words “or other employees” are omitted as unnecessary because this section only applies to pilots and copilots.
