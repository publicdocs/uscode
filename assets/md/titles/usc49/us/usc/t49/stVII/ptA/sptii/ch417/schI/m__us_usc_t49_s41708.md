    In subsection (a), the word “reasonably” is omitted as surplus. The words “carry out” are substituted for “administration” for consistency in the revised title. The words “[section 11343(c) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s11343/c]” are substituted for “section 5(8) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended” in section 407(e) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([Public Law 85–726][/us/pl/85/726], [72 Stat. 766][/us/stat/72/766]), to cite the corresponding section of the revised title and correct the inaccurate reference to the definition of “affiliate”.

    In subsection (b)(3), the word “copy” is substituted for “true copy” to eliminate an unnecessary word. The word “transportation” is substituted for “traffic” for consistency in the revised title.
