## § 41110. Effective periods and amendments, modifications, suspensions, and revocations of certificates

    (a) __General.—__ 

        (1)

         Each certificate issued under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102] is effective from the date specified in it and remains in effect until—

            (A) the Secretary of Transportation suspends or revokes the certificate under this section;

            (B) the end of the period the Secretary specifies for an air carrier having a certificate of temporary authority issued under [section 41102(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102/a/2]; or

            (C) the Secretary certifies that transportation is no longer being provided under a certificate.

        (2)

         On application or on the initiative of the Secretary and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing or, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, under [section 41111 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41111], the Secretary may—

            (A) amend, modify, or suspend any part of a certificate if the Secretary finds the public convenience and necessity require amendment, modification, or suspension; and

            (B) revoke any part of a certificate if the Secretary finds that the holder of the certificate intentionally does not comply with this chapter, sections 41308–41310(a), 41501, 41503, 41504, 41506, 41510, 41511, 41701, 41702, 41705–41709, 41711, 41712, and 41731–41742, chapter 419, subchapter II of chapter 421, and [section 46301(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s46301/b], a regulation or order of the Secretary under any of those provisions, or a term of its certificate.

        (3) The Secretary may revoke a certificate under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection only if the holder of the certificate does not comply, within a reasonable time the Secretary specifies, with an order to the holder requiring compliance.

        (4) A certificate to provide foreign air transportation may not be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked under [section 41111 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41111] if the holder of the certificate requests an oral evidentiary hearing or the Secretary finds, under all the facts and circumstances, that the hearing is required in the public interest.

    (b) __All-Cargo Air Transportation.—__ 

    The Secretary may order that a certificate issued under [section 41103 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41103] authorizing all-cargo air transportation is ineffective if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that the transportation is not provided to the minimum extent specified by the Secretary.

    (c) __Foreign Air Transportation.—__ 

        (1)

         Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2)–(4) of this section, after notice and a reasonable opportunity for the affected air carrier to present its views, but without a hearing, the Secretary may suspend or revoke the authority of an air carrier to provide foreign air transportation to a place under a certificate issued under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102] if the carrier—

            (A) notifies the Secretary, under [section 41734(a) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41734/a] or a regulation of the Secretary, that it intends to suspend all transportation to that place; or

            (B) does not provide regularly scheduled transportation to the place for 90 days immediately before the date the Secretary notifies the carrier of the action the Secretary proposes.

        (2) Paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection does not apply to a place provided seasonal transportation comparable to the transportation provided during the prior year.

    (d) __Temporary Certificates.—__ 

    On application or on the initiative of the Secretary, the Secretary may—

        (1) review the performance of an air carrier issued a certificate under [section 41102(c) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102/c] on the basis that the air carrier will provide innovative or low-priced air transportation under the certificate; and

        (2) amend, modify, suspend, or revoke the certificate or authority under subsection (a)(2) or (c) of this section if the air carrier has not provided, or is not providing, the transportation.

    (e) __Continuing Requirements.—__ 

        (1) To hold a certificate issued under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102], an air carrier must continue to be fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation authorized by the certificate and to comply with this part and regulations of the Secretary.

        (2)

         After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall amend, modify, suspend, or revoke any part of a certificate issued under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102] if the Secretary finds that the air carrier—

            (A) is not fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation authorized by the certificate and to comply with this part and regulations of the Secretary; or

            (B) does not file reports necessary for the Secretary to decide if the carrier is complying with the requirements of clause (A) of this paragraph.

    (f) __Illegal Importation of Controlled Substances.—__ 

    The Secretary—

        (1)

         in consultation with appropriate departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, shall reexamine immediately the fitness of an air carrier that—

            (A) violates the laws and regulations of the United States related to the illegal importation of a controlled substance; or

            (B) does not adopt available measures to prevent the illegal importation of a controlled substance into the United States on its aircraft; and

        (2) when appropriate, shall amend, modify, suspend, or revoke the certificate of the carrier issued under this chapter.

    (g) __Responses.—__ 

    An interested person may file a response with the Secretary opposing or supporting the amendment, modification, suspension, or revocation of a certificate under subsection (a) of this section.
