    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or the complaint of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, and if the Secretary considers it is in the public interest, the Secretary may investigate and decide whether an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent has been or is engaged in an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale of air transportation. If the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, finds that an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent is engaged in an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition, the Secretary shall order the air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to stop the practice or method.

    (b)  __E-Ticket Expiration Notice__  __.—__

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__

            (A) the name of the air carrier providing the air transportation; and

            (B) if the flight has more than one flight segment, the name of each air carrier providing the air transportation for each such flight segment.
