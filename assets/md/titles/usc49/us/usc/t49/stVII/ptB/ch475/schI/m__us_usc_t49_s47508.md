## § 47508. Noise standards for air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation

    (a)  __General Requirements__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall require each air carrier and foreign air carrier providing foreign air transportation to comply with noise standards—

        (1) the Secretary prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary in effect on January 1, 1977; or

        (2) of the International Civil Aviation Organization that are substantially compatible with standards of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982.

    (b)  __Compliance at Phased Rate__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall require each air carrier and foreign air carrier providing foreign air transportation to comply with the noise standards at a phased rate similar to the rate for aircraft registered in the United States.

    (c)  __Nondiscrimination__  __.—__ 

    The requirement for air carriers providing foreign air transportation may not be more stringent than the requirement for foreign air carriers.

    In this section, the word “providing” is substituted for “engaging in” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a), the words “acting through the Administrator” and “acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (14 CFR part 36)” are omitted for consistency. Section 6(c)(1) of the Department of Transportation Act ([Public Law 89–670][/us/pl/89/670], [80 Stat. 938][/us/stat/80/938]) transferred all duties and powers of the Federal Aviation Agency and the Administrator to the Secretary of Transportation. However, the Secretary was to carry out certain provisions through the Administrator. In addition, various laws enacted since then have vested duties and powers in the Administrator. All provisions of law the Secretary is required to carry out through the Administrator are included in 49:106(g). Before clause (1), the words “If, by January 1, 1980, the International Civil Aviation Organization (hereafter referred to as ‘ICAO’) does not reach an agreement” and “commence a rulemaking to” and 49 App.:2122(a) (last sentence) are omitted as executed. In clause (1), the words “as such regulations were” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “on noise standards and an international schedule” and “(annex 16)” are omitted as surplus. The words “of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982” are substituted for “set forth in such regulations issued by the Secretary (14 CFR parts 36 and 91) during the 5-year period thereafter” for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (b), the words “in effect” are omitted as surplus.

 __Implementation of Chapter 4 Noise Standards__ 

[Pub. L. 108–176, title III, § 325][/us/pl/108/176/s325], Dec. 12, 2003, [117 Stat. 2542][/us/stat/117/2542], provided that: 

> “Not later than April 1, 2005, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue final regulations to implement Chapter 4 noise standards, consistent with the recommendations adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization.”

 __Standards for Aircraft and Aircraft Engines To Reduce Noise Levels__ 

[Pub. L. 106–181, title VII, § 726][/us/pl/106/181/s726], Apr. 5, 2000, [114 Stat. 167][/us/stat/114/167], as amended by [Pub. L. 113–188, title XV, § 1501(f)][/us/pl/113/188/s1501/f], Nov. 26, 2014, [128 Stat. 2025][/us/stat/128/2025], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Development of New Standards__  __.—__ 

>     The Secretary \[of Transportation\] shall continue to work to develop through the International Civil Aviation Organization new performance standards for aircraft and aircraft engines that will lead to a further reduction in aircraft noise levels.

>     “(b)  __Goals To Be Considered in Developing New Standards__  __.—__ 

>     In negotiating standards under subsection (a), the Secretary shall give high priority to developing standards that—

>         “(1) are performance based and can be achieved by use of a full range of certifiable noise reduction technologies;

>         “(2) protect the useful economic value of existing Stage 3 aircraft in the United States fleet;

>         “(3) ensure that United States air carriers and aircraft engine and hushkit manufacturers are not competitively disadvantaged;

>         “(4) use dynamic economic modeling capable of determining impacts on all aircraft in service in the United States fleet; and

>         “(5) continue the use of a balanced approach to address aircraft environmental issues, taking into account aircraft technology, land use planning, economic feasibility, and airspace operational improvements.”

 __Aircraft Noise Research Program__ 

[Pub. L. 102–581, title III, § 304][/us/pl/102/581/s304], Oct. 31, 1992, [106 Stat. 4896][/us/stat/106/4896], as amended by [Pub. L. 109–155, title VII, § 706(b)][/us/pl/109/155/s706/b], Dec. 30, 2005, [119 Stat. 2937][/us/stat/119/2937], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Establishment__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall jointly conduct a research program to develop new technologies for quieter subsonic jet aircraft engines and airframes.

>     “(b)  __Goal__  __.—__ 

>     The goal of the research program established by subsection (a) is to develop by the year 2010 technologies for subsonic jet aircraft engines and airframes which would permit a subsonic jet aircraft to operate at reduced noise levels.

>     “(c)  __Participation__  __.—__ 

>     In carrying out the program established by subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall encourage the participation of representatives of the aviation industry and academia.

>     “(d)  __Report to Congress__  __.—__ 

>     The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall jointly submit to Congress, on an annual basis during the term of the program established by subsection (a), a report on the progress being made under the program toward meeting the goal described in subsection (b).”
