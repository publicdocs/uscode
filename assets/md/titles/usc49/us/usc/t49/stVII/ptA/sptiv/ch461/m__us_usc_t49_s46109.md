    The words “proceeding . . . or civil action” are substituted for “proceeding . . . whether such proceedings be instituted . . . or be begun originally in any court of the United States” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “prescribed . . . issued” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “condition, or limitation” are omitted as being included in “term”. The words “may be joined as a party or permitted to intervene” are substituted for “it shall be lawful to include as parties, or to permit the intervention of” for clarity.
