        (2)  __Standards__  __.—__ 

        The Under Secretary shall approve an application submitted by an airport operator under subsection (a) if the Under Secretary determines that the approval would not compromise security or detrimentally affect the cost-efficiency or the effectiveness of the screening of passengers or property at the airport.

        (3) __Reports on denials of applications.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            If the Under Secretary denies an application submitted by an airport operator under subsection (a), the Under Secretary shall provide to the airport operator, not later than 60 days following the date of the denial, a written report that sets forth—

                (ii) the results of any cost or security analysis conducted in considering the application; and

                (iii) recommendations on how the airport operator can address the reasons for the denial.

            (B)  __Submission to congress__  __.—__ 

            The Under Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives a copy of any report provided to an airport operator under subparagraph (A).

    (c)  __Qualified Private Screening Company__  __.—__ 

    A private screening company is qualified to provide screening services at an airport under this section if the company will only employ individuals to provide such services who meet all the requirements of this chapter applicable to Federal Government personnel who perform screening services at airports under this chapter and will provide compensation and other benefits to such individuals that are not less than the level of compensation and other benefits provided to such Federal Government personnel in accordance with this chapter.

    (d) __Standards for Private Screening Companies.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Under Secretary may enter into a contract with a private screening company to provide screening at an airport under this section only if the Under Secretary determines and certifies to Congress that—

The Under Secretary has complete discretion to reject any application from a private screening company to provide screening services at an airport that requires a waiver under this paragraph.

    (e)  __Supervision of Screened Personnel__  __.—__ 

    The Under Secretary shall provide Federal Government supervisors to oversee all screening at each airport at which screening services are provided under this section and provide Federal Government law enforcement officers at the airport pursuant to this chapter.

    (f)  __Termination of Contracts__  __.—__ 

    The Under Secretary may terminate any contract entered into with a private screening company to provide screening services at an airport under this section if the Under Secretary finds that the company has failed repeatedly to comply with any standard, regulation, directive, order, law, or contract applicable to the hiring or training of personnel to provide such services or to the provision of screening at the airport.

    (g)  __Operator of Airport__  __.—__

            (B) employees of the Federal Government providing passenger and property security screening services at the airport.

        (3) Nothing in this section shall relieve any airport operator from liability for its own acts or omissions related to its security responsibilities, nor except as may be provided by the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 shall it relieve any qualified private screening company or its employees from any liability related to its own acts of negligence, gross negligence, or intentional wrongdoing.
