    In subsection (a), the words “(except an air express company)” are substituted for “(other than companies engaged in the air express business)” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “participating carriers” are substituted for “carriers parties thereto” and “carriers participating therein” for consistency in this chapter.

    In subsection (c), the words “or the Interstate Commerce Commission, as the case may be” are omitted because of 49:10526(a)(8)(B).

 __[__  __Pub. L. 105–102__  __][/us/pl/105/102]__ 

This amends the catchline for 49:41502 to make a technical and conforming amendment necessary because section 308(l) of the ICC Termination Act ([Public Law 104–88][/us/pl/104/88], [109 Stat. 948][/us/stat/109/948]) struck “common” from the text of 49:41502.

 __Amendments__ 

    1997—[Pub. L. 105–102][/us/pl/105/102] struck out “common” before “carriers” in section catchline.

    1995—[Pub. L. 104–88][/us/pl/104/88] substituted “another carrier” for “another common carrier” in subsec. (a) and “a carrier” for “a common carrier” in subsecs. (a), (b), and (c).

 __Effective Date of 1995 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 104–88][/us/pl/104/88] effective Jan. 1, 1996, see [section 2 of Pub. L. 104–88][/us/pl/104/88/s2], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 1301 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s1301].
