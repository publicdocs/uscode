## § 47139. Emission credits for air quality projects

    (a) __In General.—__ 

    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall issue guidance on how to ensure that airport sponsors receive appropriate emission reduction credits for carrying out projects described in sections 40117(a)(3)(G), 47102(3)(K), and 47102(3)(L). Such guidance shall include, at a minimum, the following conditions:

        (1) The provision of credits is consistent with the Clean Air Act ([42 U.S.C. 7402][/us/usc/t42/s7402] et seq.).

        (2) Credits generated by the emissions reductions are kept by the airport sponsor and may only be used for purposes of any current or future general conformity determination under the Clean Air Act or as offsets under the Environmental Protection Agency’s new source review program for projects on the airport or associated with the airport.

        (3) Credits are calculated and provided to airports on a consistent basis nationwide.

        (4) Credits are provided to airport sponsors in a timely manner.

        (5) The establishment of a method to assure the Secretary that, for any specific airport project for which funding is being requested, the appropriate credits will be granted.

    (b) __Assurance of Receipt of Credits.—__ 

    As a condition for making a grant for a project described in section 47102(3)(K), 47102(3)(L), or 47140 or as a condition for granting approval to collect or use a passenger facility charge for a project described in section 40117(a)(3)(G), 47102(3)(K), 47102(3)(L), or 47140, the Secretary must receive assurance from the State in which the project is located, or from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency where there is a Federal implementation plan, that the airport sponsor will receive appropriate emission credits in accordance with the conditions of this section.

    (c) __Previously Approved Projects.—__ 

    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary, shall determine how to provide appropriate emissions credits to airport projects previously approved under section 47136 consistent with the guidance and conditions specified in subsection (a).

    (d) __State Authority Under CAA.—__
