    In this section, the text of 49 App.:1531(3) is omitted as surplus because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section.

    In clause (1)(B)(i), the words “United States Government” are substituted for “United States or any department or agency thereof” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In clause (1)(B)(ii), the words “the government of” are omitted for consistency in the revised title.

    In clause (2), the words “insurance company” are omitted as being included in “insurance carrier”. The words “means a person” are added because they are inclusive. The words “group or association” are omitted as being included in “person”. The word “State” is substituted for “State of the United States” to eliminate unnecessary words.
