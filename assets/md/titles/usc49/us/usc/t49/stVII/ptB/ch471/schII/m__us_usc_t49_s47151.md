## § 47151. Authority to transfer an interest in surplus property

    (a)  __General Authority__  __.—__ 

    Subject to sections 47152 and 47153 of this title, a department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government or a wholly owned Government corporation may convey to a State, political subdivision of a State, or tax-supported organization any interest in surplus property—

        (1)

         that the Secretary of Transportation decides is—

            (A) desirable for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport (as defined in [section 47102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s47102]);

            (B) reasonably necessary to fulfill the immediate and foreseeable future requirements for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport; or

            (C) needed for developing sources of revenue from nonaviation businesses at a public airport; and

        (2) if the Administrator of General Services approves the conveyance and decides the interest is not best suited for industrial use.

    (b)  __Ensuring Compliance__  __.—__ 

    Only the Secretary may ensure compliance with an instrument conveying an interest in surplus property under this subchapter. The Secretary may amend the instrument to correct the instrument or to make the conveyance comply with law.

    (c)  __Disposing of Interests Not Conveyed Under This Subchapter__  __.—__ 

    An interest in surplus property that could be used at a public airport but that is not conveyed under this subchapter shall be disposed of under other applicable law.

    (d)  __Waiver of Condition__  __.—__ 

    Before the Secretary may waive any condition imposed on an interest in surplus property conveyed under subsection (a) that such interest be used for an aeronautical purpose, the Secretary must provide notice to the public not less than 30 days before waiving such condition.

    (e)  __Requests by Public Agencies__  __.—__ 

    Except with respect to a request made by another department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government, such a department, agency, or instrumentality shall give priority consideration to a request made by a public agency (as defined in section 47102) for surplus property described in subsection (a) for use at a public airport.

In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act” are omitted as surplus. The words “Subject to sections 47152 and 47153 of this title” are substituted for “but subject to the terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions hereinafter provided for” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “a department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch of the United States Government or a wholly owned Government corporation” are substituted for “any disposal agency designated pursuant to this Act” for clarity because disposal agencies were Government agencies designated under 50 App.:1619(a), that was repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 399][/us/stat/63/399]), and Government agencies were all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the executive branch of the United States Government and wholly owned Government corporations. The word “give” is substituted for “convey or dispose of . . . without monetary consideration to the United States”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “municipality” is omitted as being included in “political subdivision”. The words “of a State” are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word “organization” is substituted for “institution” for consistency in the revised title. The words “all of the right, title, and . . . of the United States . . . and to . . . real or personal” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1)(A), the words “essential, suitable, or” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1)(B), the words “of the grantee” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “\[War Assets\] Administrator” in section 13(g)(1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (ch. 479, [58 Stat. 765][/us/stat/58/765]) because of section 105 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 381][/us/stat/63/381]). The words “and decides the interest is not best suited for industrial use” are substituted for “(exclusive of property the highest and best use of which is determined by the Administrator of General Services to be industrial and which shall be so classified for disposal without regard to the provisions of this subsection)” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Subsection (b) is substituted for 50 App.:1622b to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), the text of 50 App.:1622(g)(5) is omitted as obsolete because 50 App.:1621, 1622(f), and 1627(e) were repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 399][/us/stat/63/399]). The words “An interest in surplus property that could be used at a public airport” are substituted for “All surplus property within the purview of this subsection” for clarity. The words “elsewhere in this Act or other applicable” are omitted as surplus. The word “law” is substituted for “Federal Statute” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.
