## § 44921. Federal flight deck officer program

    (a)  __Establishment__  __.—__ 

    The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall establish a program to deputize volunteer pilots of air carriers providing air transportation or intrastate air transportation as Federal law enforcement officers to defend the flight decks of aircraft of such air carriers against acts of criminal violence or air piracy. Such officers shall be known as “Federal flight deck officers”.

    (b) __Procedural Requirements.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 3 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Under Secretary shall establish procedural requirements to carry out the program under this section.

        (2)  __Commencement of program__  __.—__ 

        Beginning 3 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Under Secretary shall begin the process of training and deputizing pilots who are qualified to be Federal flight deck officers as Federal flight deck officers under the program.

        (3)  __Issues to be addressed__  __.—__ 

        The procedural requirements established under paragraph (1) shall address the following issues:

            (A) The type of firearm to be used by a Federal flight deck officer.

            (B) The type of ammunition to be used by a Federal flight deck officer.

            (C) The standards and training needed to qualify and requalify as a Federal flight deck officer.

            (D) The placement of the firearm of a Federal flight deck officer on board the aircraft to ensure both its security and its ease of retrieval in an emergency.

            (E) An analysis of the risk of catastrophic failure of an aircraft as a result of the discharge (including an accidental discharge) of a firearm to be used in the program into the avionics, electrical systems, or other sensitive areas of the aircraft.

            (F) The division of responsibility between pilots in the event of an act of criminal violence or air piracy if only 1 pilot is a Federal flight deck officer and if both pilots are Federal flight deck officers.

            (G) Procedures for ensuring that the firearm of a Federal flight deck officer does not leave the cockpit if there is a disturbance in the passenger cabin of the aircraft or if the pilot leaves the cockpit for personal reasons.

            (H) Interaction between a Federal flight deck officer and a Federal air marshal on board the aircraft.

            (I) The process for selection of pilots to participate in the program based on their fitness to participate in the program, including whether an additional background check should be required beyond that required by section 44936(a)(1).

            (J) Storage and transportation of firearms between flights, including international flights, to ensure the security of the firearms, focusing particularly on whether such security would be enhanced by requiring storage of the firearm at the airport when the pilot leaves the airport to remain overnight away from the pilot’s base airport.

            (K) Methods for ensuring that security personnel will be able to identify whether a pilot is authorized to carry a firearm under the program.

            (L) Methods for ensuring that pilots (including Federal flight deck officers) will be able to identify whether a passenger is a law enforcement officer who is authorized to carry a firearm aboard the aircraft.

            (M) Any other issues that the Under Secretary considers necessary.

            (N) The Under Secretary’s decisions regarding the methods for implementing each of the foregoing procedural requirements shall be subject to review only for abuse of discretion.
