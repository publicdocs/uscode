    In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words “the Secretary of Transportation or State or the United States Postal Service” are substituted for “the Board, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of Transportation” because under 49 App.:1551 the duties of the Civil Aeronautics Board were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation and the Postal Service.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “shall order the information withheld from public disclosure when the appropriate Secretary or the Postal Service decides that disclosure of the information” are substituted for “shall be withheld from public disclosure by the Board, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Transportation” for clarity and because of the restatement.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Board, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of Transportation, as the case may be, shall be responsible for classified information in accordance with appropriate law” are omitted as surplus.
