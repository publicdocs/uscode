    (1)

     establish a single system of measuring noise that—

        (A) has a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of individuals to noise; and

        (B) is applied uniformly in measuring noise at airports and the surrounding area;

    (2) establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise resulting from airport operations, including noise intensity, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence; and

    (3) identify land uses normally compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise.
