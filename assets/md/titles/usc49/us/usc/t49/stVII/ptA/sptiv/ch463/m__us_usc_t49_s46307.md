    The words “In addition to the penalties otherwise provided for by this chapter” are omitted as surplus. The word “prescribed” is added for consistency in the revised title. The words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “a fine of not exceeding $10,000”, and the words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted, for consistency with title 18. The words “and upon conviction thereof” and “such fine and imprisonment” are omitted as surplus.
