## § 44506. Air traffic controllers

    (a)  __Research on Effect of Automation on Performance__  __.—__ 

    To develop the means necessary to establish appropriate selection criteria and training methodologies for the next generation of air traffic controllers, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall conduct research to study the effect of automation on the performance of the next generation of air traffic controllers and the air traffic control system. The research shall include investigating—

        (1) methods for improving and accelerating future air traffic controller training through the application of advanced training techniques, including the use of simulation technology;

        (2) the role of automation in the air traffic control system and its physical and psychological effects on air traffic controllers;

        (3) the attributes and aptitudes needed to function well in a highly automated air traffic control system and the development of appropriate testing methods for identifying individuals with those attributes and aptitudes;

        (4) innovative methods for training potential air traffic controllers to enhance the benefits of automation and maximize the effectiveness of the air traffic control system; and

        (5) new technologies and procedures for exploiting automated communication systems, including Mode S Transponders, to improve information transfers between air traffic controllers and aircraft pilots.

    (b)  __Research on Human Factor Aspects of Automation__  __.—__ 

    The Administrators of the Federal Aviation Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration may make an agreement for the use of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s unique human factor facilities and expertise in conducting research activities to study the human factor aspects of the highly automated environment for the next generation of air traffic controllers. The research activities shall include investigating—

        (1) human perceptual capabilities and the effect of computer-aided decision making on the workload and performance of air traffic controllers;

        (2) information management techniques for advanced air traffic control display systems; and

        (3) air traffic controller workload and performance measures, including the development of predictive models.

    (c)  __Collegiate Training Initiative__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may maintain the Collegiate Training Initiative program by making new agreements and continuing existing agreements with institutions of higher education (as defined by the Administrator) under which the institutions prepare students for the position of air traffic controller with the Department of Transportation (as defined in [section 2109 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s2109]). The Administrator may establish standards for the entry of institutions into the program and for their continued participation.

        (2)

            (A) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may appoint an individual who has successfully completed a course of training in a program described in paragraph (1) of this subsection to the position of air traffic controller noncompetitively in the excepted service (as defined in [section 2103 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s2103]). An individual appointed under this paragraph serves at the pleasure of the Administrator, subject to [section 7511 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s7511]. However, an appointment under this paragraph may be converted from one in the excepted service to a career conditional or career appointment in the competitive civil service (as defined in [section 2102 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s2102]) when the individual achieves full performance level air traffic controller status, as decided by the Administrator.

            (B) The authority under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to make appointments in the excepted service expires on October 6, 1997, except that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may extend the authority for one or more successive one-year periods.

    (d) __Air Traffic Control Specialist Qualification Training.—__ 

        (1)  __Appointment of air traffic control specialists__  __.—__ 

        The Administrator is authorized to appoint a qualified air traffic control specialist candidate for placement in an airport traffic control facility if the candidate has—

            (A) received a control tower operator certification (referred to in this subsection as a “CTO” certificate); and

            (B) satisfied all other applicable qualification requirements for an air traffic control specialist position, including successful completion of orientation training at the Federal Aviation Administration Academy.

        (2)  __Compensation and benefits__  __.—__ 

        An individual appointed under paragraph (1) shall receive the same compensation and benefits, and be treated in the same manner as, any other individual appointed as a developmental air traffic controller.

        (3)  __Report__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report that evaluates the effectiveness of the air traffic control specialist qualification training provided pursuant to this section, including the graduation rates of candidates who received a CTO certificate and are working in airport traffic control facilities.

        (4)  __Additional appointments__  __.—__ 

        If the Administrator determines that air traffic control specialists appointed pursuant to this subsection are more successful in carrying out the duties of an air traffic controller than air traffic control specialists hired from the general public without any such certification, the Administrator shall increase, to the maximum extent practicable, the number of appointments of candidates who possess such certification.

        (5) __Reimbursement for travel expenses associated with certifications.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (B), the Administrator may accept reimbursement from an educational entity that provides training to an air traffic control specialist candidate to cover reasonable travel expenses of the Administrator associated with issuing certifications to such candidates.

            (B)  __Treatment of reimbursements__  __.—__ 

            Notwithstanding [section 3302 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3302], any reimbursement authorized to be collected under subparagraph (A) shall—

                (i) be credited as offsetting collections to the account that finances the activities and services for which the reimbursement is accepted;

                (ii) be available for expenditure only to pay the costs of activities and services for which the reimbursement is accepted, including all costs associated with collecting such reimbursement; and

                (iii) remain available until expended.

    (e)  __Staffing Report__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall submit annually to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing—

        (1) the staffing standards used to determine the number of air traffic controllers needed to operate the air traffic control system of the United States;

        (2) a 3-year projection of the number of controllers needed to be employed to operate the system to meet the standards; and

        (3) a detailed plan for employing the controllers, including projected budget requests.
