    Modifications made under subsection (b) of this section—

        (1) may include a system of titling aircraft or registering all aircraft, even aircraft not operated;

        (2) shall ensure positive, verifiable, and timely identification of the true owner; and

            (A) the registration of aircraft to fictitious persons.

            (B) the use of false or nonexistent addresses by persons registering aircraft.

            (C) the use by a person registering an aircraft of a post office box or “mail drop” as a return address to evade identification of the person’s address.

            (D) the registration of aircraft to entities established to facilitate unlawful activities.

            (E) the submission of names of individuals on applications for registration of aircraft that are not identifiable.

            (F) the ability to make frequent legal changes in the registration markings assigned to aircraft.

            (G) the use of false registration markings on aircraft.

            (H) the illegal use of “reserved” registration markings on aircraft.

            (I) the large number of aircraft classified as being in “self-reported status”.

            (J) the lack of a system to ensure timely and adequate notice of the transfer of ownership of aircraft.

            (K) the practice of allowing temporary operation and navigation of aircraft without the issuance of a certificate of registration.

        (1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in subsection (c) of this section.
