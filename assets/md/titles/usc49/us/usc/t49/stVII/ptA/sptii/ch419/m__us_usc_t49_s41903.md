## § 41903. Duty to provide certain transportation of mail

    (a) __Air Carriers.—__ 

    Subject to subsection (b) of this section, an air carrier authorized by its certificate to transport mail by aircraft between places in Alaska shall—

        (1) provide facilities and services necessary and adequate to provide that transportation; and

        (2) transport mail between the places authorized in the certificate for transportation of mail when required, and under regulations prescribed, by the United States Postal Service.

    (b) __Maximum Mail Load.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe the maximum mail load for a schedule or for an aircraft or type of aircraft for the transportation of mail by aircraft between places in Alaska. If the Postal Service tenders to an air carrier mail exceeding the maximum load for transportation by the carrier under a schedule designated or required to be established for the transportation of mail under [section 41902(c) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41902/c], the carrier, as nearly in accordance with the schedule as the Secretary decides is possible, shall—

        (1) provide facilities sufficient to transport the mail to the extent the Secretary decides the carrier reasonably is able to do so; and

        (2) transport that mail.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Subject to subsection (b) of this section” are added for clarity because subsection (b) limits the effect of this section. The words “transport mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska” are substituted for “the transportation of mail” in 49 App.:1371(l) and “the transportation of mail by aircraft” in 49 App.:1375(d) because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(l) and 1375(d) no longer apply to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). Clause (2) is substituted for “shall transport mail whenever required by the United States Postal Service” in 49 App.:1371(l) and the text of 49 App.:1375(d) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 49 App.:1371(l) (last sentence) is omitted as surplus because section 41901 of the revised title specifies how the rates of compensation are determined.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska” are added because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1375(c) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation of mail (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska).
