    In the section, the text of 49 App.:1371(j) (related to interstate and overseas transportation of persons) is omitted because of 49 App.:1551(a)(1)(D). The text of 49 App.:1371(j) (related to other interstate and overseas air transportation and the domestic air transportation of mail) is omitted because a certificate of public convenience and necessity is no longer required. See H.R. Rept. 98–793, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1984). The text of 49 App.:1371(j) (related to essential air transportation) is omitted as superseded by 49 App.:1389, restated as subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49.

    In subsection (a)(1) and (2), the word “place” is substituted for “point” for consistency in the revised title. The words “by that decision” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (a)(1), the words “which it is providing” are omitted as surplus. The word “authority” is substituted for “agency” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “between those places” are substituted for “being provided by such air carrier under such certificate” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “by regulation or otherwise” are omitted as surplus. The words “when the Secretary finds the suspension is in” are substituted for “as may be” for clarity and consistency.

 __[__  __Pub. L. 104–287__  __][/us/pl/104/287]__ 

    This amends 49:41312(a)(1) to conform to the style of title 49.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 104–287][/us/pl/104/287] substituted “Secretary of Transportation” for “Secretary”.

 __Effective Date__ 

    Section effective July 5, 1994, see [section 9 of Pub. L. 103–429][/us/pl/103/429/s9], set out as an Effective Date of 1994 Amendment note under [section 321 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s321].
