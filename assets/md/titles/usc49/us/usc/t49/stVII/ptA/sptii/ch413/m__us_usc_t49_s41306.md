    In subsection (a)(1), the words “acting on” are substituted for “disposition of” for consistency. The word “provide” is substituted for “engage in” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(2), the word “alteration” is omitted as surplus. The word “transfer” is omitted because 49 App.:1372(f) does not cover transfer of a permit.

    In subsection (b), the word “adequate” is omitted as surplus.
