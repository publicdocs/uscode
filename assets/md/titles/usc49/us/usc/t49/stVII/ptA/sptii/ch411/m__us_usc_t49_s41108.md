## § 41108. Applications for certificates

    (a)  __Form, Contents, and Proof of Service__  __.—__ 

    To be issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102], a citizen of the United States must apply to the Secretary of Transportation. The application must—

        (1) be in the form and contain information required by regulations of the Secretary; and

        (2) be accompanied by proof of service on interested persons as required by regulations of the Secretary and on each community that may be affected by the issuance of the certificate.

    (b)  __Notice, Response, and Actions on Applications__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         When an application is filed, the Secretary shall post a notice of the application in the office of the Secretary and give notice of the application to other persons as required by regulations of the Secretary. An interested person may file a response with the Secretary opposing or supporting the issuance of the certificate. Not later than 90 days after the application is filed, the Secretary shall—

            (A) provide an opportunity for a public hearing on the application;

            (B) begin the procedure under [section 41111 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41111]; or

            (C) dismiss the application on its merits.

        (2) An order of dismissal issued by the Secretary under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection is a final order and may be reviewed judicially under [section 46110 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s46110].

        (3)

         If the Secretary provides an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, an initial or recommended decision shall be issued not later than 150 days after the date the Secretary provides the opportunity. The Secretary shall issue a final order on the application not later than 90 days after the decision is issued. However, if the Secretary does not act within the 90-day period, the initial or recommended decision on an application to provide—

            (A) interstate air transportation is a final order and may be reviewed judicially under [section 46110 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s46110]; and

            (B) foreign air transportation shall be submitted to the President under [section 41307 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41307].

        (4) If the Secretary acts under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall issue a final order on the application not later than 180 days after beginning the procedure on the application.

        (5) If a citizen applying for a certificate does not meet the procedural schedule adopted by the Secretary in a proceeding, the Secretary may extend the period for acting under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection by a period equal to the period of delay caused by the citizen. In addition to an extension under this paragraph, an initial or recommended decision under paragraph (3) of this subsection may be delayed for not more than 30 days in extraordinary circumstances.

    (c)  __Proof Requirements__  __.—__ 

        (1) A citizen applying for a certificate must prove that the citizen is fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation referred to in [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102] and to comply with this part.

        (2) A person opposing a citizen applying for a certificate must prove that the transportation referred to in [section 41102(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102/b/2] is not consistent with the public convenience and necessity. The transportation is deemed to be consistent with the public convenience and necessity unless the Secretary finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the transportation is not consistent with the public convenience and necessity.

    In subsection (b)(3), before clause (A), the words “If the Secretary provides an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection” are substituted for “If the Board determines that any application should be set for a public hearing under clause (A) of the second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection” to eliminate unnecessary words.
