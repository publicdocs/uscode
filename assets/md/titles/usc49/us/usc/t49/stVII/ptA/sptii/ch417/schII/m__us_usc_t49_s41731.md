## § 41731. Definitions

    (a)  __General__  __.—__ 

    In this subchapter—

        (1)

         “eligible place” means a place in the United States that—

                    (II) received scheduled air transportation at any time after January 1, 1990; and

                    (III) is not listed in Department of Transportation Orders 89–9–37 and 89–12–52 as a place ineligible for compensation under this subchapter; or

                (ii) was determined, on or after October 1, 1988, and before the date of the enactment of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, under this subchapter by the Secretary of Transportation to be eligible to receive subsidized small community air service under section 41736(a);

            (B) had an average of 10 enplanements per service day or more, as determined by the Secretary, during the most recent fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2012;

            (C) had an average subsidy per passenger of less than $1,000 during the most recent fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary; and

            (D)

             is a community that, at any time during the period between September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2011, inclusive—

                (i) received essential air service for which compensation was provided to an air carrier under this subchapter; or

                (ii) received a 90-day notice of intent to terminate essential air service and the Secretary required the air carrier to continue to provide such service to the community.

        (2) “enhanced essential air service” means scheduled air transportation to an eligible place of a higher level or quality than basic essential air service described in [section 41732 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41732].

    (b)  __Limitation on Authority To Decide a Place Not an Eligible Place__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary may not decide that a place described in subsection (a)(1) of this section is not an eligible place on any basis that is not specifically stated in this subchapter.

    (c)  __Exception for Locations in Alaska and Hawaii__  __.—__ 

    Subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of subsection (a)(1) shall not apply with respect to locations in the State of Alaska or the State of Hawaii.

    Subsection (a)(1)(B) shall not apply with respect to locations that are more than 175 driving miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport.

    (e)  __Waivers__  __.—__ 

    For fiscal year 2013 and each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary may waive, on an annual basis, subsection (a)(1)(B) with respect to a location if the location demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the reason the location averages fewer than 10 enplanements per day is due to a temporary decline in enplanements.

    (f)  __Definition__  __.—__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(B), the term “enplanements” means the number of passengers enplaning, at an eligible place, on flights operated by the subsidized essential air service carrier.
