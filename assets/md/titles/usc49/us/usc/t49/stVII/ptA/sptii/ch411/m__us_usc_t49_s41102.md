        (2) In addition to the findings under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary, before issuing a certificate under subsection (a) of this section for foreign air transportation, must find that the transportation is consistent with the public convenience and necessity.

    The Secretary may issue a certificate under subsection (a) of this section for interstate air transportation (except the transportation of passengers) or foreign air transportation for a temporary period of time (whether the application is for permanent or temporary authority) when the Secretary decides that a test period is desirable—

        (1) to decide if the projected services, efficiencies, methods, and prices and the projected results will materialize and remain for a sustained period of time; or

    In this section, the words “citizen of the United States” and “citizen” are substituted for “applicant” for clarity and consistency because only a citizen of the United States may be an “air carrier” as defined in section 40102(a) of the revised title, and only an air carrier may be a “charter air carrier” as defined in section 40102(a). The word “provide” is substituted for “perform” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “of public convenience and necessity” are added for clarity. The words “any part of” are substituted for “the whole or any part of” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clauses (2) and (3), the words “In the case of” are omitted as surplus. In clause (3), the words “for such periods” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b)(1), the word “comply” is substituted for “conform” for consistency in the revised title. The words “properly” and “requirements” are omitted as surplus. The word “rules” is omitted as being synonymous with “regulations”.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “foreign air transportation” are added because 49 App.:1551(a)(1)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(d)(1)–(3) no longer applies to interstate or overseas transportation of persons. After January 1, 1985, other interstate and overseas air transportation and the domestic air transportation of mail do not require a certificate of public convenience and necessity. See H. Rept. 98–793, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., p.10 (1984).

    In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words “issue a certificate” are substituted for “grant an application” for consistency in this chapter. The words “for interstate air transportation (except the transportation of passengers) or foreign air transportation” are added for clarity and consistency. The word “only” is omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the word “prices” is substituted for “rates, fares, charges” because of the definition of “price” in section 40102(a) of the revised title. The words “in fact” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “to assess the impact of the new services on the national air route structure, or otherwise” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (d) is added for clarity.
