    In clause (1), the words “each certificate of registration issued under [section 44103 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44103] and each certificate issued under [section 44704 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44704]” are substituted for “certificates of registration, or aircraft certificates” for clarity and because of the restatement.

    In clause (2), the words “recording transactions” are substituted for “recording of discharges and satisfactions of recorded instruments, and other transactions” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “title to” are omitted as being included in “interest in”. The words “to decide” are substituted for “to facilitate the determination” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “related to” are substituted for “dealing with” for clarity. The word “spare” is added for consistency in this section.
