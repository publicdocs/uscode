## § 44722. Aircraft operations in winter conditions

    The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations requiring procedures to improve safety of aircraft operations during winter conditions. In deciding on the procedures to be required, the Administrator shall consider at least aircraft and air traffic control modifications, the availability of different types of deicing fluids (considering their efficacy and environmental limitations), the types of deicing equipment available, and the feasibility and desirability of establishing timeframes within which deicing must occur under certain types of inclement weather.

    The words “Before November 1, 1992” are omitted as obsolete. The words “prescribe regulations requiring” are substituted for “require, by regulation”, and the words “other factors the Administrator considers appropriate” are substituted for “among other things”, for consistency in the revised title.
