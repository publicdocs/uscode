## § 41505. Uniform methods for establishing joint prices, and divisions of joint prices, applicable to commuter air carriers

    (a)  __Definition__  __.—__ 

    In this section, “commuter air carrier” means an air carrier providing transportation under [section 40109(f) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s40109/f] that provides at least 5 scheduled roundtrips a week between the same 2 places.

    (b)  __General__  __.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, when the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under section 41508 or 41509 of this title a uniform method generally applicable to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers holding certificates issued under [section 41102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s41102], the Secretary shall make that uniform method apply to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers and commuter air carriers.

    (c)  __Notice Required Before Modifying, Suspending, or Ending Transportation__  __.—__ 

    A commuter air carrier that has an agreement with an air carrier to provide transportation for passengers and property that includes through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier’s routes and air transportation provided by the air carrier shall give the air carrier and the Secretary at least 90 days’ notice before modifying, suspending, or ending the transportation. If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.

    In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of “air carrier” in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to “section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 \[49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)\]” has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 ([Public Law 95–504][/us/pl/95/504], [92 Stat. 1705][/us/stat/92/1705]). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for 416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word “scheduled” is substituted for “pursuant to flight schedules” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “the same 2 places” are substituted for “one pair of points” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (b), the words “Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section” are added for clarity. The words “pursuant to its authority” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the word “passengers” is substituted for “persons” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier’s routes” are substituted for “transportation over its routes” for clarity. The words “between air carriers and commuter air carriers” are omitted as surplus.
