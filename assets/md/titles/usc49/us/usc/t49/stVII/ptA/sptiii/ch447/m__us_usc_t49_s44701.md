## § 44701. General requirements

    (a)  __Promoting Safety__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall promote safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing—

        (1) minimum standards required in the interest of safety for appliances and for the design, material, construction, quality of work, and performance of aircraft, aircraft engines, and propellers;

        (2)

         regulations and minimum standards in the interest of safety for—

            (A) inspecting, servicing, and overhauling aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances;

            (B) equipment and facilities for, and the timing and manner of, the inspecting, servicing, and overhauling; and

        (3) regulations required in the interest of safety for the reserve supply of aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, appliances, and aircraft fuel and oil, including the reserve supply of fuel and oil carried in flight;

        (4) regulations in the interest of safety for the maximum hours or periods of service of airmen and other employees of air carriers; and

        (5) regulations and minimum standards for other practices, methods, and procedure the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce and national security.

    (b)  __Prescribing Minimum Safety Standards__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator may prescribe minimum safety standards for—

        (1) an air carrier to whom a certificate is issued under [section 44705 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s44705]; and

        (2) operating an airport serving any passenger operation of air carrier aircraft designed for at least 31 passenger seats.

    (c)  __Reducing and Eliminating Accidents__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator shall carry out this chapter in a way that best tends to reduce or eliminate the possibility or recurrence of accidents in air transportation. However, the Administrator is not required to give preference either to air transportation or to other air commerce in carrying out this chapter.

    (d)  __Considerations and Classification of Regulations and Standards__  __.—__ 

    When prescribing a regulation or standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any of sections 44702–44716 of this title, the Administrator shall—

        (1)

         consider—

            (A) the duty of an air carrier to provide service with the highest possible degree of safety in the public interest; and

            (B) differences between air transportation and other air commerce; and

        (2) classify a regulation or standard appropriate to the differences between air transportation and other air commerce.

    (e) __Bilateral Exchanges of Safety Oversight Responsibilities.—__

        (3)  __Conditions__  __.—__ 

        The Administrator may predicate, in the agreement, the transfer of functions and duties under this subsection on any conditions the Administrator deems necessary and prudent, except that the Administrator may not transfer responsibilities for United States registered aircraft described in paragraph (4)(A) to a country that the Administrator determines is not in compliance with its obligations under international law for the safety oversight of civil aviation.

        (4)  __Registered aircraft defined__  __.—__ 

        In this subsection, the term “registered aircraft” means—

            (A) aircraft registered in the United States and operated pursuant to an agreement for the lease, charter, or interchange of the aircraft or any similar arrangement by an operator that has its principal place of business or, if it has no such place of business, its permanent residence in another country; and

            (B) aircraft registered in a foreign country and operated under an agreement for the lease, charter, or interchange of the aircraft or any similar arrangement by an operator that has its principal place of business or, if it has no such place of business, its permanent residence in the United States.

    (f)  __Exemptions__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any of sections 44702–44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the exemption is in the public interest.
