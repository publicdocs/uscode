    In this section, the words “foreign air transportation” are substituted for “transportation” and “in the case of overseas or foreign air transportation” because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)–(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining “air transportation” to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word “conditions” is omitted as being included in “terms”.

    In subsection (a)(7), the words “or other emergency” are substituted for “other calamitous visitation” for consistency.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “no longer gainfully employed” are substituted for “retired” and “For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘retired’ means no longer gainfully employed as defined by the Board” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b)(4), the words “an individual who has severely impaired vision or hearing or another physical or mental handicap” are substituted for “handicapped person” and “For the purposes of this subsection, the term ‘handicapped person’ means any person who has severely impaired vision or hearing, and any other physically or mentally handicapped person, as defined by the Board” to eliminate unnecessary words.
