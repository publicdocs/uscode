## § 47525. Decision about airport noise and access restrictions on certain stage 2 aircraft

    The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study and decide on the application of section 47524(a)–(d) of this title to airport noise and access restrictions on the operation of stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of not more than 75,000 pounds. In making the decision, the Secretary shall consider—

    (1) noise levels produced by those aircraft relative to other aircraft;

    (2) the benefits to general aviation and the need for efficiency in the national air transportation system;

    (3) the differences in the nature of operations at airports and the areas immediately surrounding the airports;

    (4) international standards and agreements on aircraft noise; and

    (5) other factors the Secretary considers necessary.

    In this section, before clause (1), the words “conduct a study and decide on” are substituted for “determine by a study” for clarity. The words “with a maximum weight of not more than” are substituted for “weighing less than” for consistency with sections 47528 and 47529 of the revised title.
