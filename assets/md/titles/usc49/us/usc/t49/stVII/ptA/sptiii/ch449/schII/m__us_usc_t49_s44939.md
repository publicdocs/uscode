        (2) the Secretary has not directed, within 30 days after being notified under paragraph (1), that person not to provide the requested training because the Secretary has determined that the individual presents a risk to aviation or national security.

    (b)  __Interruption of Training__  __.—__ 

    If the Secretary of Homeland Security, more than 30 days after receiving notification under subsection (a) from a person providing training described in subsection (a), determines that the individual presents a risk to aviation or national security, the Secretary shall immediately notify the person providing the training of the determination and that person shall immediately terminate the training.

    (c)  __Notification__  __.—__ 

    A person operating as a flight instructor, pilot school, or aviation training center or subject to regulation under this part may provide training in the operation of any aircraft having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less to an alien (as defined in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ([8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/3])) or to any other individual specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security only if that person has notified the Secretary that the individual has requested such training and furnished the Secretary with that individual’s identification in such form as the Secretary may require.

    (d)  __Expedited Processing__  __.—__

        (3) is an individual that has unescorted access to a secured area of an airport designated under section 44936(a)(1)(A)(ii); or

        (4) is an individual that is part of a class of individuals that the Secretary has determined that providing aviation training to presents minimal risk to aviation or national security because of the aviation training already possessed by such class of individuals.

    (e)  __Training__  __.—__ 

    In subsection (a), the term “training” means training received from an instructor in an aircraft or aircraft simulator and does not include recurrent training, ground training, or demonstration flights for marketing purposes.

For fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, the Secretary may adjust the maximum amount of the fee to reflect the costs of such an investigation.

        (2)  __Offset__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding [section 3302 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s3302], any fee collected under this section—
