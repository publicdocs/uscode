## § 44308. Administrative

    (a)  __Commercial Practices__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation may carry out this chapter consistent with commercial practices of the aviation insurance business.

    (b)  __Issuance of Policies and Disposition of Claims__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary may issue insurance policies to carry out this chapter. The Secretary may prescribe the forms, amounts insured under the policies, and premiums charged. Any such policy may authorize the binding arbitration of claims made thereunder in such manner as may be agreed to by the Secretary and any commercial insurer that may be responsible for any part of a loss to which such policy relates. The Secretary may change an amount of insurance or a premium for an existing policy only with the consent of the insured.

        (2)

         For a claim under insurance authorized by this chapter, the Secretary may—

            (A) settle and pay the claim made for or against the United States Government;

            (B) pay the amount of a binding arbitration award made under paragraph (1); and

            (C) pay the amount of a judgment entered against the Government.

    (c)  __Underwriting Agent__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary may, and when practical shall, employ an insurance carrier or group of insurance carriers to act as an underwriting agent. The Secretary may use the agent, or a claims adjuster who is independent of the underwriting agent, to adjust claims under this chapter, but claims may be paid only when approved by the Secretary.

        (2) The Secretary may pay reasonable compensation to an underwriting agent for servicing insurance the agent writes for the Secretary. Compensation may include payment for reasonable expenses incurred by the agent but may not include a payment by the agent for stimulation or solicitation of insurance business.

        (3) Except as provided by this subsection, the Secretary may not pay an insurance broker or other person acting in a similar capacity any consideration for arranging insurance when the Secretary directly insures any part of the risk.

    (d)  __Budget__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall submit annually a budget program for carrying out this chapter as provided for wholly owned Government corporations under chapter 91 of title 31.

    (e)  __Accounts__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall maintain a set of accounts for audit under chapter 35 of title 31. Notwithstanding chapter 35, the Comptroller General shall allow credit for expenditures under this chapter made consistent with commercial practices in the aviation insurance business when shown to be necessary because of the business activities authorized by this chapter.
