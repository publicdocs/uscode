    (b)  __Application of Procedural Requirements__  __.—__ 

    A statutory requirement related to notice, an opportunity for a hearing, action on the record, or administrative review that applied to a duty or power transferred by the Act applies to the Secretary or Administrator when carrying out the duty or power.

    (c)  __Nonapplication__  __.—__ 

    This section does not apply to a duty or power transferred from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Secretary under section 6(e)(1)–(4) and (6)(A) of the Act.

    In this subchapter, the words “duty or power” are substituted for “functions, powers, and duties” for clarity and consistency. The words “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government” are substituted for “department or agency” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a), the word “orders” is omitted as being included in “action”.
