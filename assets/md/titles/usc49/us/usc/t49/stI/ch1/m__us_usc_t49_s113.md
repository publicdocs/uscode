 __Prioritizing Statutory Rulemakings__ 

[Pub. L. 114–94, div. A, title V][/us/pl/114/94/dA/tV], § 5302, Dec. 4, 2015, [129 Stat. 1543][/us/stat/129/1543], provided that: 

> “The Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration shall prioritize the completion of each outstanding rulemaking required by statute before beginning any other rulemaking, unless the Secretary \[of Transportation\] determines that there is a significant need for such other rulemaking and notifies Congress of such determination.”

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 106–159][/us/pl/106/159], § 3, Dec. 9, 1999, [113 Stat. 1749][/us/stat/113/1749], provided that: 

> “Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) The current rate, number, and severity of crashes involving motor carriers in the United States are unacceptable.

>     “(2) The number of Federal and State commercial motor vehicle and operator inspections is insufficient and civil penalties for violators must be utilized to deter future violations.

>     “(3) The Department of Transportation is failing to meet statutorily mandated deadlines for completing rulemaking proceedings on motor carrier safety and, in some significant safety rulemaking proceedings, including driver hours-of-service regulations, extensive periods have elapsed without progress toward resolution or implementation.

>     “(4) Too few motor carriers undergo compliance reviews and the Department’s data bases and information systems require substantial improvement to enhance the Department’s ability to target inspection and enforcement resources toward the most serious safety problems and to improve States’ ability to keep dangerous drivers off the roads.

>     “(5) Additional safety inspectors and inspection facilities are needed in international border areas to ensure that commercial motor vehicles, drivers, and carriers comply with United States safety standards.

>     “(6) The Department should rigorously avoid conflicts of interest in federally funded research.

>     “(7) Meaningful measures to improve safety must be implemented expeditiously to prevent increases in motor carrier crashes, injuries, and fatalities.

>     “(8) Proper use of Federal resources is essential to the Department’s ability to improve its research, rulemaking, oversight, and enforcement activities related to commercial motor vehicles, operators, and carriers.”

 __Purposes__ 

[Pub. L. 106–159][/us/pl/106/159], § 4, Dec. 9, 1999, [113 Stat. 1749][/us/stat/113/1749], provided that: 

> “The purposes of this Act \[see Tables for classification\] are—

>     “(1) to improve the administration of the Federal motor carrier safety program and to establish a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in the Department of Transportation; and

>     “(2) to reduce the number and severity of large-truck involved crashes through more commercial motor vehicle and operator inspections and motor carrier compliance reviews, stronger enforcement measures against violators, expedited completion of rulemaking proceedings, scientifically sound research, and effective commercial driver’s license testing, recordkeeping and sanctions.”

 __Savings Provision__ 

[Pub. L. 106–159, title I][/us/pl/106/159/tI], § 106, Dec. 9, 1999, [113 Stat. 1756][/us/stat/113/1756], provided that:

>         “(2) that are in effect on the effective date of such transfer (or become effective after such date pursuant to their terms as in effect on such effective date),

>         shall continue in effect according to their terms until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked in accordance with law by the Administration, any other authorized official, a court of competent jurisdiction, or operation of law.

>     “(c) __Proceedings.—__ 

>         “(1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

>         The provisions of this Act shall not affect any proceedings or any application for any license pending before the Office at the time this Act takes effect \[see Effective Date of 1999 Amendment note set out under [section 104 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s104]\], insofar as those functions are transferred by this Act; but such proceedings and applications, to the extent that they relate to functions so transferred, shall be continued. Orders shall be issued in such proceedings, appeals shall be taken therefrom, and payments shall be made pursuant to such orders, as if this Act had not been enacted; and orders issued in any such proceedings shall continue in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by a duly authorized official, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law.
