## § 326. Gifts

    (a) The Secretary of Transportation may accept and use conditional or unconditional gifts of property for the Department of Transportation. The Secretary may accept a gift of services in carrying out aviation duties and powers. Property accepted under this section and proceeds from that property must be used, as nearly as possible, under the terms of the gift.

        (1) gifts of money;

        (2) income from property accepted under this section and proceeds from the sale of that property; and

        (3) income from securities under subsection (c) of this section.

    (c) On request of the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the Treasury may invest and reinvest amounts in the fund in securities of, or in securities whose principal and interest is guaranteed by, the United States Government.

    (d) Property accepted under this section is a gift to or for the use of the Government under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ([26 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t26/s1] et seq.).

    In the section, the word “gifts” is substituted for “gifts and bequests” in 49:1657(m)(1) because it is inclusive.

    In subsection (a), the words “accept and use” are substituted for “accept, hold, administer, and utilize”, and the words “for the Department” are substituted for “for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of the Department” in 49:1657(m)(1), to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “property” is substituted for “property, both real and personal” in 49:1657(m)(1), and “gift or donation of money or other property, real and personal” in 49:1344(c)(1) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “aviation duties and powers” are added because the source provisions being restated only applies to carrying out duties and powers related to the Federal Aviation Administration. The words “under this section and proceeds from that property” are substituted for “pursuant to this paragraph, and the proceeds thereof” in 49:1657(m)(1) for clarity.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Department has a” and “The fund consists of” are added for clarity and because of the restatement of the section. The word “separate” before “fund” is omitted as unnecessary and for consistency. The words “from the fund” are added for clarity. The words “accepted under this section” are substituted for “held by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1)” for clarity. The words “that property” are substituted for “other property received as gifts or bequests” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “from securities under subsection (c) of this section” are substituted for “accruing from such securities” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “amounts in the fund” are substituted for “any moneys contained in the fund provided for in paragraph (1)” for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (d), the words “under this section” are substituted for “under paragraph (1)” because of the restatement of the section. The words “the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 ([26 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t26/s1] et seq.)” are substituted for “For the purpose of Federal income, estate, and gift taxes” for consistency.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”.
