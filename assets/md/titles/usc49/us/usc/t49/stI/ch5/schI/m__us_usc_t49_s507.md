    The section is included because 49:1655(f)(2) gave the same administrative powers exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission under certain sections of title 49 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out duties transferred to the Secretary by 49:1655(e). See the revision notes for section 501 of the revised title for an explanation of the transfer under 49:1655(f)(2). The powers of the Commission have been codified in subtitle IV of the revised title. The comparable provisions of title 49 that are represented by the section may be found as follows:

    See the revision notes for the revised sections for an explanation of changes made in the text. Changes not accounted for in those revision notes are as follows:

    In the section, the text of 49:322(b)(2) and (3) is not included for motor carriers of migrant workers and motor private carriers because those provisions, while included in the enumeration in 49:304(a)(3) and (3a), are not included in the specific enumeration of 49:1655(f)(2)(B)(ii).

    In subsections (a) and (d), the text of 49:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st–7th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st–5th words) is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (a), the words “or of any term or condition of any certificate or permit” are omitted as not applicable to this chapter.

    In subsection (a)(1), reference to a civil action to enforce an order for the payment of money is omitted as not applicable to this chapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 103–272][/us/pl/103/272] substituted “subchapter III of chapter 311 (except sections 31138 and 31139) or [section 31502 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s31502]” for “[section 3102 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s3102] or the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984” and “any of those provisions” for “such section or Act”.

    1984—Subsecs. (c) to (e). [Pub. L. 98–554][/us/pl/98/554] added subsec. (c) and redesignated former subsecs. (c) and (d) as (d) and (e), respectively.

 __DOT Implementation Plan__ 

[Pub. L. 105–178, title IV, § 4026][/us/pl/105/178/s4026], June 9, 1998, [112 Stat. 416][/us/stat/112/416], provided that:

>     “(a)  __Assessment__  __.—__ 

>     Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this section \[June 9, 1998\], the Secretary \[of Transportation\] shall assess the scope of the problem of shippers, freight forwarders, brokers, consignees, or other persons (other than rail carriers, motor carriers, motor carriers of migrant workers, or motor private carriers) encouraging violations of chapter 5 of title 49, United States Code, or a regulation or order issued by the Secretary under such chapter.

>     “(b)  __Submission of Implementation Plan__  __.—__ 

>     After completion of the assessment under subsection (a), the Secretary may submit to the Congress a plan for implementing authority (if subsequently provided by law) to investigate and bring civil actions to enforce chapter 5 of title 49, United States Code, or regulations or orders issued by the Secretary under such chapter with respect to persons described in subsection (a).

>     “(c)  __Contents of Implementation Plan__  __.—__ 

>     In developing the implementation plan under subsection (b), the Secretary shall consider, as appropriate—

>         “(1) in what circumstances the Secretary would exercise the new authority;

>         “(2) how the Secretary would determine that shippers, freight forwarders, brokers, consignees, or other persons committed violations described in subsection (a), including what types of evidence would be conclusive;

>         “(3) what procedures would be necessary during investigations to ensure the confidentiality of shipper contract terms prior to the Secretary’s findings of violations;

>         “(4) what impact the exercise of the new authority would have on the Secretary’s resources, including whether additional investigative or legal resources would be necessary and whether the staff would need specialized education or training to exercise properly such authority;

>         “(5) to what extent the Secretary would conduct educational activities for persons who would be subject to the new authority; and

>         “(6) any other information that would assist the Congress in determining whether to provide the Secretary the new authority.”
