    (a)

     When necessary and not otherwise available, the Secretary of Transportation may provide for, construct, or maintain the following for officers and employees of the Department of Transportation and their dependents stationed in remote places:

        (1) emergency medical services and supplies.

        (2) food and other subsistence supplies.

        (3) messing facilities.

        (4) motion picture equipment and film for recreation and training.

        (5) living and working quarters and facilities.

        (6) reimbursement for food, clothing, medicine, and other supplies provided by an officer or employee in an emergency for the temporary relief of individuals in distress.

    (b) The Secretary shall prescribe reasonable charges for medical treatment provided under subsection (a)(1) of this section and for supplies and services provided under subsection (a)(2) and (3) of this section. Amounts received under this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation from which the expenditure was made.

    (c) When appropriations for a fiscal year for aviation duties and powers have not been made before June 1 immediately before the beginning of the fiscal year, the Secretary may designate an officer, and authorize that officer, to incur obligations to buy and transport supplies to carry out those duties and powers at installations outside the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia. The amount obligated under this subsection in a fiscal year may be not more than 75 percent of the amount available for buying and transporting supplies to those installations for the then current fiscal year. Payment of obligations under this subsection shall be made from appropriations for the next fiscal year when available.

    In subsection (a), the text of 49:1657(l) (words before 3d comma) is omitted as unnecessary. The words “of the Department of Transportation” are added for clarity. In clause (6), the words “individuals in distress” are substituted for “distressed persons” as being more precise.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Secretary shall prescribe reasonable charges” are substituted for “shall be at prices reflecting reasonable value as determined by the Secretary” for clarity and to eliminate surplus words. The words “services, supplies, and facilities provided under subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section” are substituted for “The furnishing of medical treatment under paragraph (1) and the furnishing of services and supplies under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection” to eliminate surplus words. The words “Amounts received under this subsection” are substituted for “and the proceeds therefrom” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “aviation duties and powers” are substituted for “the Administration” in 49:1344(b) because of the transfer of aviation functions to the Secretary of Transportation under 49:1655(c)(1). The words “before June 1” are substituted for “prior to the first day of March” in 49:1344(b) to conform to the change in the start of the fiscal year from July 1 to October 1 under 31:1020(a)(2). The words “and materials necessary” after “supplies” in 49:1344(b) are omitted as surplus. The words “to carry out those duties and powers” are substituted for “necessary to the proper execution of the Secretary of Transportation’s functions” in 49:1344(b) for clarity and consistency. The words “the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia” are substituted for “the continental United States” in 49:1344(b) for clarity. The words “including those in Alaska” before “in amounts” in 49:1344(b) are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the section. The words “The amount obligated under this subsection in a fiscal year” in 49:1344(b) are added for clarity. The words “available for buying and transporting supplies to those installations” are substituted for “made available for such purposes” in 49:1344(b) for clarity. The word “succeeding” after “next” in 49:1344(b) is omitted as surplus.

 __[__  __Pub. L. 103–272__  __][/us/pl/103/272]__ 

    Section 4(j)(8) amends 49:331(b) to follow more closely the language in former 49:1657(l) on which it was based.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–272][/us/pl/103/272] substituted “medical treatment provided under subsection (a)(1) of this section and for supplies and services provided under subsection (a)(2) and (3) of this section” for “services, supplies, and facilities provided under subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section”.
