In subsection (a), the word “information” is substituted for “data, statistics, and other information” in 49:1634 to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “transportation system of the United States” are substituted for “national transportation system” in 49:1634 for clarity and consistency. The words “in carrying out this activity” before “the Secretary shall” in 49:1634 are omitted as surplus. The words “departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government” are substituted for “Federal agencies” in 49:1634 for clarity and consistency. The words “To the greatest extent practical” are substituted for “insofar as practicable” in 49:1634 for consistency. The words “The Secretary shall” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (b), the words “by the National Transportation Safety Board under title VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([49 U.S.C. 1441][/us/usc/t49/s1441] et seq.) or the Civil Aeronautics Board under title IV of that Act ([49 U.S.C. 1371][/us/usc/t49/s1371] et seq.)” are substituted for “the Board under subchapter IV and VII of this chapter)” in 49:1352 because 49:1655(d) (1st sentence) transferred duties of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49:ch. 20, subch. VII to the Secretary of Transportation to be carried out through the National Transportation Safety Board. The reference to the National Transportation Safety Board is to the independent Board established by section 303(a) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 ([Pub. L. 93–633][/us/pl/93/633], [88 Stat. 2167][/us/stat/88/2167]) outside the Department of Transportation and not to the prior Board that was a part of the Department. The words “departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government” are substituted for “government channels” in 49:1352 for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “of the United States” are added for clarity and consistency. The words “of a State, territory, or possession” are substituted for “thereof” after “subdivision” for clarity. The words “related to the duties and powers of the Secretary” are substituted for “falling within the province of the Department” for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “governmental authority requesting information under paragraph (1) of this subsection” are substituted for “body requesting it” for clarity and consistency. The word “separate” before “account” is omitted as unnecessary and for consistency. The words “must pay” are substituted for “upon the payment” after “other records” for clarity. The words “preparing the information” are substituted for “such work” after “actual cost of” for clarity. The word “payments” is substituted for “All moneys received by the Department in payment of the cost of work under paragraph (1)” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “in the Treasury” are added for clarity and consistency. The words “The Secretary may use amounts in the account” are substituted for “These moneys may be used, in the discretion of the Secretary” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “to getting and providing the information” are substituted for “to the work and/or to secure in connection therewith the special services of persons who are neither officers nor employees of the United States” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (d), the words “in carrying out duties and powers under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 ([49 U.S.C. 1301][/us/usc/t49/s1301] et seq.)” are substituted for “in discharge of responsibilities under this chapter” in 49:1343(b) because of the transfer of aviation functions to the Secretary under 49:1655(c)(1) and for consistency. The words “directly related to carrying out that part” are substituted for “directly relating to such responsibilities” in 49:1343(b) because of the restatement of the source provisions.
