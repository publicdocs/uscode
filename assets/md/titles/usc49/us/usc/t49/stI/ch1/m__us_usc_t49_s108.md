    Subsection (a) reflects the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Transportation as provided by the source provisions and 14:1. The words “Except when operating as a service of the Navy” are substituted for 49:1655(b)(2) because of 14:3. The words “The Secretary of Transportation exercises . . . vested in the Secretary of the Treasury . . . immediately before April 1, 1967” are substituted for “and there are hereby transferred to and vested in the Secretary . . . of the Secretary of the Treasury” to reflect the transfer of duties and powers to the Secretary of Transportation on April 1, 1967, the effective date of the Department of Transportation Act ([Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670], [80 Stat. 931][/us/stat/80/931]).

    In subsection (b), the first sentence is included to provide the name of the officer in charge of the Coast Guard, as reflected in 14:44. In the 2d sentence, the words “carrying out the duties and powers specified by law” are substituted for “such functions, powers, and duties as are specified in this chapter to be carried out”, and the words “carry out duties and powers prescribed” are substituted for “carry out such additional functions, powers, and duties as”, for consistency.
