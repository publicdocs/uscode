    In this section, the words “officer or employee” are substituted for “employee” for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a), the words “Secretary of Transportation or the head of a component of the Department of Transportation” are substituted for “Department of Transportation, including any of its agencies” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.

    In subsection (b), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “Office of the Secretary of Transportation” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “within that agency” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (c), the words “An officer or employee required to submit to toxicological testing may not assert” are substituted for “may not be asserted” for clarity.
