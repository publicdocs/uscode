## § 304. Application of categorical exclusions for multimodal projects

    (a)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the following definitions apply:

        (1)  __Cooperating authority__  __.—__ 

        The term “cooperating authority” means a Department of Transportation operating authority that is not the lead authority with respect to a project.

        (2)  __Lead authority__  __.—__ 

        The term “lead authority” means a Department of Transportation operating administration or secretarial office that—

            (A) is the lead authority over a proposed multimodal project; and

            (B)

             has determined that the components of the project that fall under the modal expertise of the lead authority—

                (i) satisfy the conditions for a categorical exclusion under implementing regulations or procedures of the lead authority under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.); and

                (ii) do not require the preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under that Act.

        (3)  __Multimodal project__  __.—__ 

        The term “multimodal project” has the meaning given the term in [section 139(a) of title 23][/us/usc/t23/s139/a].

    (b)  __Exercise of Authorities__  __.—__ 

    The authorities granted in this section may be exercised for a multimodal project, class of projects, or program of projects that are carried out under this title.

    (c)  __Application of Categorical Exclusions for Multimodal Projects__  __.—__ 

    In considering the environmental impacts of a proposed multimodal project, a lead authority may apply a categorical exclusion designated under the implementing regulations or procedures of a cooperating authority for other components of the project, subject to the conditions that—

        (1) the multimodal project is funded under 1 grant agreement administered by the lead authority;

        (2) the multimodal project has components that require the expertise of a cooperating authority to assess the environmental impacts of the components;

        (3) the component of the project to be covered by the categorical exclusion of the cooperating authority has independent utility;

        (4)

         the cooperating authority, in consultation with the lead authority—

            (A) follows implementing regulations or procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.); and

            (B) determines that a categorical exclusion under that Act applies to the components; and

        (5)

         the lead authority has determined that—

            (A) the project, using the categorical exclusions of the lead authority and each applicable cooperating authority, does not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the environment; and

            (B) extraordinary circumstances do not exist that merit additional analysis and documentation in an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.).

    (d) __Modal Cooperation.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        A cooperating authority shall provide modal expertise to the lead authority on such aspects of the multimodal project in which the cooperating authority has expertise.

        (2)  __Use of categorical exclusion__  __.—__ 

        In a case described in paragraph (1), the 1 or more categorical exclusions of a cooperating authority may be applied by the lead authority once the cooperating authority reviews the project on behalf of the lead authority and determines the project satisfies the conditions for a categorical exclusion under the implementing regulations or procedures of the cooperating authority under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.) and this section.

    In subsection (a), the text of 49:1653(g) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (a)(4), the word “ensure” is substituted for “assure” as being more precise. The words “of the United States Government” are substituted for “Federal”, and the words “United States” are substituted for “national”, for clarity and consistency.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Secretaries shall report on April 1 of each year” are substituted for “They shall, within one year after the effective date of the Act, and annually thereafter, report” to omit executed words and to specify the date of April 1 because the President prescribed April 1, 1967, as the effective date of the Department of Transportation Act ([Pub. L. 89–670][/us/pl/89/670], [80 Stat. 931][/us/stat/80/931]) by Executive Order No. 11340, March 30, 1967 (32 F.R. 5443). The word “consider” is substituted for “determine” for consistency.
