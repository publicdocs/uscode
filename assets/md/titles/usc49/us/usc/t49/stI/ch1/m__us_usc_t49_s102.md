    In subsection (a), the words “There is hereby established” and “to be known as” are omitted as executed. The words “(hereafter referred to in this chapter as the ‘Department’)” are omitted as unnecessary because of the style used in codifying the revised title. The words “of the United States Government” are added for clarity.

    In subsection (b), the words “(hereafter referred to in this chapter as the ‘Secretary’)” are omitted as unnecessary because of the style used in codifying the revised title.

    In subsection (c), the words “carry out duties and powers” and “acts for” are substituted for “act for and exercise the powers of” and “perform such functions, powers, and duties”, respectively, for consistency and to eliminate surplus words. The words “unable to serve” are substituted for “disability” for consistency and clarity.

    In subsection (d), the words “in the competitive service” are substituted for “under the classified civil service” to conform to 5:2102. The words “from time to time” are omitted as surplus. The words “acts for” are substituted for “act for, and exercise the powers of” for consistency and to eliminate surplus words. The words “when the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary are absent or unable to serve, or when the offices of Secretary and Deputy Secretary are vacant” are substituted for “during the absence or disability of the Deputy Secretary, or in the event of a vacancy in the office of a Deputy Secretary” as being more precise and for consistency.

    In subsection (e), the words “The Secretary shall cause a . . . of office” and “of such device” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.
