    (a)  __Transfer of Possession Upon Payment__  __.—__

        (2)  __Extensions of credit to governmental entities__  __.—__ 

        Such a carrier (including a motor carrier being used by a household goods freight forwarder) may extend credit for transporting property for the United States Government, a State, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of any of them.

            (B)  __Calculation of prorated charges__  __.—__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), the prorated percentage of the charges shall be the percentage of the total charges due to the carrier as described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) that is equal to the percentage of the weight of that portion of the shipment delivered to the total weight of the shipment.

            (C)  __Post-contract services__  __.—__ 

            Subparagraph (A) does not apply to additional services requested by a shipper after the contract of service is executed that were not included in the estimate.
