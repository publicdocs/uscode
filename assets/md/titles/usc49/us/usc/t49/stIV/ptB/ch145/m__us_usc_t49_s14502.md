        (3)  __Motor carrier transportation property__  __.—__ 

        The term “motor carrier transportation property” means property, as defined by the Secretary, owned or used by a motor carrier providing transportation in interstate commerce whether or not such transportation is subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135.

        (4)  __Commercial and industrial property__  __.—__ 

        The term “commercial and industrial property” means property, other than transportation property and land used primarily for agricultural purposes or timber growing, devoted to a commercial or industrial use, and subject to a property tax levy.

    (b)  __Acts Burdening Interstate Commerce__  __.—__ 

    The following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce and a State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a State or subdivision of a State may not do any of them:

        (1)  __Excessive valuation of property__  __.—__ 

        Assess motor carrier transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the motor carrier transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.

        (2)  __Tax on assessment__  __.—__ 

        Levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under paragraph (1).

        (3)  __Ad valorem tax__  __.—__

    (c) __Jurisdiction.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding [section 1341 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1341] and without regard to the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties, a district court of the United States has jurisdiction, concurrent with other jurisdiction of courts of the United States and the States, to prevent a violation of subsection (b) of this section.

        (2)  __Limitation in relief__  __.—__ 

        Relief may be granted under this subsection only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of motor carrier transportation property exceeds, by at least 5 percent, the ratio of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.

        (3)  __Burden of proof__  __.—__ 

        The burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by State law.

        (4)  __Violation__  __.—__ 

        If the ratio of the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the assessment jurisdiction to the true market value of all other commercial and industrial property cannot be determined to the satisfaction of the district court through the random-sampling method known as a sales assessment ratio study (to be carried out under statistical principles applicable to such a study), the court shall find, as a violation of this section—

            (A) an assessment of the motor carrier transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the motor carrier transportation property than the assessment value of all other property subject to a property tax levy in the assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of all such other property; and

            (B) the collection of ad valorem property tax on the motor carrier transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax ratio rate applicable to taxable property in the taxing district.
