    (c)  __Factors To Consider in Determining Amount__  __.—__ 

    In determining and negotiating the amount of a civil penalty under subsection (a) or (d) concerning transportation of household goods, the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, the degree of harm to shipper or shippers, ability to pay, the effect on ability to do business, whether the shipper has been adequately compensated before institution of the proceeding, and such other matters as fairness may require shall be taken into account.

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        If a carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 or a receiver or trustee of such carrier fails or refuses to comply with any regulation issued by the Secretary or the Board relating to protection of individual shippers, such carrier, receiver, or trustee is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 for each violation and for each additional day during which the violation continues.

        (2)  __Estimate of broker without carrier agreement__  __.—__ 

        If a broker for transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 makes an estimate of the cost of transporting any such goods before entering into an agreement with a carrier to provide transportation of household goods subject to such jurisdiction, the broker is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 for each violation.

        (3)  __Unauthorized transportation__  __.—__ 

        If a person provides transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 or provides broker services for such transportation without being registered under chapter 139 to provide such transportation or services as a motor carrier or broker, as the case may be, such person is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not less than $25,000 for each violation.

    (e)  __Violation Relating to Transportation of Household Goods__  __.—__ 

    Any person that knowingly engages in or knowingly authorizes an agent or other person—

        (1) to falsify documents used in the transportation of household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 which evidence the weight of a shipment; or

        (2) to charge for accessorial services which are not performed or for which the carrier is not entitled to be compensated in any case in which such services are not reasonably necessary in the safe and adequate movement of the shipment;

        is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not less than $2,000 for each violation and of not less than $5,000 for each subsequent violation. Any State may bring a civil action in the United States district courts to compel a person to pay a civil penalty assessed under this subsection.

    (f)  __Venue__  __.—__ 

    Trial in a civil action under subsections (a) through (e) of this section is in the judicial district in which—

        Process in the action may be served in the judicial district of which the offender is an inhabitant or in which the offender may be found.

    (g) __Business Entertainment Expenses.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Any business entertainment expense incurred by a water carrier providing transportation subject to this part shall not constitute a violation of this part if that expense would not be unlawful if incurred by a person not subject to this part.

        (2)  __Cost of service__  __.—__ 

        Any business entertainment expense subject to paragraph (1) that is paid or incurred by a water carrier providing transportation subject to this part shall not be taken into account in determining the cost of service or the rate base for purposes of section 13702.

    (h)  __Settlement of Civil Penalties__  __.—__ 

    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from accepting partial payment of a civil penalty as part of a settlement agreement in the public interest, or from holding imposition of any part of a civil penalty in abeyance.
