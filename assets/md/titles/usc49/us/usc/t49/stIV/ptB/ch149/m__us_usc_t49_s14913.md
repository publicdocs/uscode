## § 14913. Conclusiveness of rates in certain prosecutions

    When a carrier publishes or files a particular rate under section 13702 or participates in such a rate, the published or filed rate is conclusive proof against that carrier, its officers, and agents that it is the legal rate for that transportation or service in a proceeding begun under section 14902 or 14903. A departure, or offer to depart, from that published or filed rate is a violation of those sections.

(Added [Pub. L. 104–88, title I, § 103][/us/pl/104/88/s103], Dec. 29, 1995, [109 Stat. 918][/us/stat/109/918].)
