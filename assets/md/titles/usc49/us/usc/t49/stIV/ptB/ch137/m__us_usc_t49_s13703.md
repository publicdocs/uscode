            (B) denying, ending, or changing approval,

            (C) prescribing the conditions on which approval is granted, or

            (D) changing those conditions,

        (2)  __Periodic review of approvals__  __.—__ 

        Subject to this section, in the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this paragraph and in each 5-year period thereafter, the Board shall initiate a proceeding to review any agreement approved pursuant to this section.

        Nothing in this section shall serve as a basis for any undercharge claim.

        (2)  __Obligation of shipper__  __.—__ 

        Nothing in this title, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, or any amendments or repeals made by such Act shall be construed as creating any obligation for a shipper based solely on a classification that was on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or elsewhere on December 31, 1995.

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            (A)  __Public availability__  __.—__ 

            Routes, rates, classifications, mileage guides, and rules established under agreements approved under this section shall be published and made available for public inspection upon request.

            (B)  __Participation of carriers__  __.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                A motor carrier of property whose routes, rates, classifications, mileage guides, rules, or packaging are determined or governed by publications established under agreements approved under this section must participate in the determining or governing publication for such provisions to apply.

                (ii)  __Power of attorney__  __.—__ 

                The motor carrier of property shall issue a power of attorney to the publishing agent and, upon its acceptance, the agent shall issue a written certification to the motor carrier affirming its participation in the governing publication, and the certification shall be made available for public inspection.

        (2)  __Mileage limitation__  __.—__
