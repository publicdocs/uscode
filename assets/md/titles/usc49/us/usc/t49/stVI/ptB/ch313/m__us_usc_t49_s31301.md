    In clause (1), the text of 49 App.:2716(13) is omitted as surplus because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section.

    In clause (4)(A), the words “at least 26,001 pounds” are substituted for “26,001 or more pounds”, and the word “prescribes” is substituted for “determines appropriate”, for consistency in the revised title.

    In clause (4)(B), the words “at least 16 passengers” are substituted for “more than 15 passengers” for consistency.

    Clause (4)(C)(i) is substituted for “and which has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 26,001 pounds (or such gross vehicle weight rating as determined appropriate by the Secretary under subparagraph (A))” to eliminate unnecessary words. In subclause (iii), the words “deny the application of this exception” are substituted for “waive the application of the preceding sentence” for clarity and because of the restatement.

    In clause (11), the words “public streets, roads, or” are added for consistency in the revised title.

    In clause (12)(C), the words “involving a fatality” are substituted for “arising in connection with a fatal traffic accident” to eliminate unnecessary words.
