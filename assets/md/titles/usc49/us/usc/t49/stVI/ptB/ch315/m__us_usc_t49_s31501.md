    In clause (1), the words “going to or from” are substituted for “proceeding to or returning from” for clarity.

    Clause (2) is included to ensure that the identical definitions that are relevant are used without repeating them. The source provisions for the quoted definitions are found in the revision notes for section 10102 of the revised title.

    In clause (3), the words “including any ‘contract common carrier by motor vehicle’ ” are omitted as covered by the definition of “motor carrier”. The words “referred to in [section 10521(a) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s10521/a]” are substituted for “in interstate or foreign commerce” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The word “except” is substituted for “but not including” for clarity. The words “at least” are substituted for “or more”, and the words “but the term does not include” are substituted for “except”, for consistency.
