## § 32304A. Consumer tire information and standards

    (a) __Consumer Tire Information.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, the Secretary of Transportation (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) shall, after notice and opportunity for comment, promulgate rules establishing a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program for replacement tires designed for use on motor vehicles to educate consumers about the effect of tires on automobile fuel efficiency, safety, and durability.

        (2)  __Items included in rule__  __.—__ 

        The rulemaking shall include—

            (A) a national tire fuel efficiency rating system for motor vehicle replacement tires to assist consumers in making more educated tire purchasing decisions;

            (B) requirements for providing information to consumers, including information at the point of sale and other potential information dissemination methods, including the Internet;

            (C) specifications for test methods for manufacturers to use in assessing and rating tires to avoid variation among test equipment and manufacturers; and

            (D) a national tire maintenance consumer education program including, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “, including”. </sup></sup>  information on tire inflation pressure, alignment, rotation, and tread wear to maximize fuel efficiency, safety, and durability of replacement tires.

        (3)  __Applicability__  __.—__ 

        This section shall apply only to replacement tires covered under section 575.104(c) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, in effect on the date of the enactment of the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act.

    (b) __Promulgation of Regulations for Tire Fuel Efficiency Minimum Performance Standards.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall promulgate regulations for tire fuel efficiency minimum performance standards for—

            (A) passenger car tires with a maximum speed capability equal to or less than 149 miles per hour or 240 kilometers per hour; and

            (B) passenger car tires with a maximum speed capability greater than 149 miles per hour or 240 kilometers per hour.

        (2) __Tire fuel efficiency minimum performance standards.—__ 

            (A)  __Standard basis and test procedures__  __.—__ 

            The minimum performance standards promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be expressed in terms of the rolling resistance coefficient measured using the test procedure specified in section 575.106 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act). <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

            (B)  __No disparate effect on high performance tires__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that the minimum performance standards promulgated under paragraph (1) will not have a disproportionate effect on passenger car high performance tires with a maximum speed capability greater than 149 miles per hour or 240 kilometers per hour.

            (C) __Applicability.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                This subsection applies to new pneumatic tires for use on passenger cars.

                (ii)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

                This subsection does not apply to light truck tires, deep tread tires, winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare tires, or tires with nominal rim diameters of 12 inches or less.

    (c) __Promulgation of Regulations for Tire Wet Traction Minimum Performance Standards.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for tire wet traction minimum performance standards to ensure that passenger tire wet traction capability is not reduced to achieve improved tire fuel efficiency.

        (2) __Tire wet traction minimum performance standards.—__ 

            (A)  __Basis of standard__  __.—__ 

            The minimum performance standards promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be expressed in terms of peak coefficient of friction.

            (B)  __Test procedures__  __.—__ 

            Any test procedure promulgated under this subsection shall be consistent with any test procedure promulgated under subsection (a).

            (C)  __Benchmarking__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall conduct testing to benchmark the wet traction performance of tire models available for sale in the United States as of the date of enactment of this Act 2 to ensure that the minimum performance standards promulgated under paragraph (1) are tailored to—

                (i) tires sold in the United States; and

                (ii) the needs of consumers in the United States.

            (D) __Applicability.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                This subsection applies to new pneumatic tires for use on passenger cars.

                (ii)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

                This subsection does not apply to light truck tires, deep tread tires, winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare tires, or tires with nominal rim diameters of 12 inches or less.

    (d) __Coordination Among Regulations.—__ 

        (1)  __Compatibility__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall ensure that the test procedures and requirements promulgated under subsections (a), (b), and (c) are compatible and consistent.

        (2)  __Combined effect of rules__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall evaluate the regulations promulgated under subsections (b) and (c) to ensure that compliance with the minimum performance standards promulgated under subsection (b) will not diminish wet traction performance of affected tires.

        (3)  __Rulemaking deadlines__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall promulgate—

            (A) the regulations under subsections (b) and (c) not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act; 2 and

            (B) the regulations under subsection (c) not later than the date of promulgation of the regulations under subsection (b).

    (e)  __Consultation__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on the means of conveying tire fuel efficiency consumer information.

    (f)  __Report to Congress__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall conduct periodic assessments of the rules promulgated under this section to determine the utility of such rules to consumers, the level of cooperation by industry, and the contribution to national goals pertaining to energy consumption. The Secretary shall transmit periodic reports detailing the findings of such assessments to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.

    (g)  __Tire Marking__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall not require permanent labeling of any kind on a tire for the purpose of tire fuel efficiency information.

    (h)  __Application With State and Local Laws and Regulations__  __.—__ 

    Nothing in this section prohibits a State or political subdivision thereof from enforcing a law or regulation on tire fuel efficiency consumer information that was in effect on January 1, 2006. After a requirement promulgated under this section is in effect, a State or political subdivision thereof may adopt or enforce a law or regulation on tire fuel efficiency consumer information enacted or promulgated after January 1, 2006, if the requirements of that law or regulation are identical to the requirement promulgated under this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt a State or political subdivision thereof from regulating the fuel efficiency of tires (including establishing testing methods for determining compliance with such standards) not otherwise preempted under this chapter.
