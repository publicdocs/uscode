    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “(including a member of the uniformed services)” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. In clause (1), the words “from that date through the date the vehicle is imported into the United States” are substituted for “that date and the date of entry of such motor vehicle” for clarity and consistency in this chapter. In clause (2), the words “under this section or section 108(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966” are substituted for “this subsection” to preserve the exemption for motor vehicles imported under the source provisions between October 30, 1988, and the effective date of this restatement. In clause (4), the word “imports” is substituted for “enters” for clarity and consistency in this chapter. In clause (5) the word “satisfies” is substituted for “meets the terms, conditions, and other requirements . . . under” to eliminate unnecessary words.
