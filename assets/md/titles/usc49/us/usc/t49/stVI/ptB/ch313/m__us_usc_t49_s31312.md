    A State (other than a State subject to an order under subsection (a)) may issue a non-resident commercial driver’s license to an individual domiciled in a State that is prohibited from such activities under subsection (a) if that individual meets all requirements of this chapter and the nonresident licensing requirements of the issuing State.
