    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “reported to, or otherwise” and “or the Secretary’s representative” are omitted as surplus. The words “related to a confidential matter referred to” are substituted for “contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title. The words “or in [section 552(b)(4) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b/4]” are omitted as surplus because the language in 18:1905 is broader than the language in 5:552(b)(4) and for consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this part. The words “shall be considered confidential for the purpose of the applicable section of this subchapter” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “for use in carrying out” are substituted for “concerned with carrying out” for consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this part. In clause (2), the words “when relevant” are omitted as surplus. The cross-reference to 15:2023(a)(3) is omitted. The text of 15:2023(a)(3), originally enacted as section 603(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act ([Public Law 92–513][/us/pl/92/513], [86 Stat. 947][/us/stat/86/947]), was repealed by section 303(2) of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 ([Public Law 102–519][/us/pl/102/519], [106 Stat. 3396][/us/stat/106/3396]). Section 303(2) also redesignated subsection (a)(4) as subsection (a)(3). However, a corresponding amendment to correct the cross-reference in the source provisions restated in this section was not made.

    In subsection (b), the words “authorized to have the information” are added for clarity and consistency with similar provisions in other chapters in this part.
