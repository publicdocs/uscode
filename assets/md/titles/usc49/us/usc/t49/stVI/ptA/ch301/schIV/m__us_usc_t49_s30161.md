## § 30161. Judicial review of standards

    (a)  __Filing and Venue__  __.—__ 

    A person adversely affected by an order prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under this chapter may apply for review of the order by filing a petition for review in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of business. The petition must be filed not later than 59 days after the order is issued.

    The clerk of the court shall send immediately a copy of the petition to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary shall file with the court a record of the proceeding in which the order was prescribed.

    (c)  __Additional Proceedings__  __.—__ 

        (1) On request of the petitioner, the court may order the Secretary to receive additional evidence and evidence in rebuttal if the court is satisfied that the additional evidence is material and there were reasonable grounds for not presenting the evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary.

        (2) The Secretary may modify findings of fact or make new findings because of the additional evidence presented. The Secretary shall file a modified or new finding, a recommendation to modify or set aside the order, and the additional evidence with the court.

    (d)  __Certified Copies of Records of Proceedings__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall give any interested person a certified copy of the transcript of the record in a proceeding under this section on request and payment of costs.

    A judgment of a court under this section is final and may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court under [section 1254 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1254].
