## § 30121. Provisional notification and civil actions to enforce

    (a)  __Provisional Notification__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         The Secretary of Transportation may order a manufacturer to issue a provisional notification if a civil action about an order issued under [section 30118(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30118/b] has been brought under [section 30163 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30163]. The provisional notification shall contain—

            (A) a statement that the Secretary has decided that a defect related to motor vehicle safety or noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter exists and that the manufacturer is contesting the decision in a civil action in a United States district court;

            (B) a clear description of the Secretary’s stated basis for the decision;

            (C) the Secretary’s evaluation of the risk to motor vehicle safety reasonably related to the defect or noncompliance;

            (D) measures the Secretary considers necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety resulting from the defect or noncompliance;

            (E) a statement that the manufacturer will remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge under [section 30120 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30120], but that the requirement to remedy without charge is conditioned on the outcome of the civil action; and

            (F) other information the Secretary prescribes by regulation or includes in the order requiring the notice.

        (2) A notification under this subsection does not relieve a manufacturer of liability for not giving notification required by an order under [section 30118(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30118/b].

    (b)  __Civil Actions for Not Notifying__  __.—__ 

        (1) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers under section 30119(c) and (d) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty, unless the manufacturer prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section or the court in that action enjoins enforcement of the order. Enforcement may be enjoined only if the court decides that the failure to notify is reasonable and that the manufacturer has demonstrated the likelihood of prevailing on the merits. If enforcement is enjoined, the manufacturer is not liable during the time the order is stayed.

        (2) A manufacturer that does not notify owners and purchasers as required under subsection (a) of this section is liable for a civil penalty regardless of whether the manufacturer prevails in an action on the validity of the order issued under [section 30118(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30118/b].

    (c)  __Orders to Manufacturers__  __.—__ 

    If the Secretary prevails in a civil action referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer—

        (1) to notify each owner, purchaser, and dealer described in [section 30119(d) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30119/d] of the outcome of the action and other information the Secretary requires, and notification under this clause may be combined with notification required under [section 30118(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30118/b];

        (2) to specify the earliest date under [section 30119(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30119/b] on which the defect or noncompliance will be remedied without charge under [section 30120 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30120]; and

        (3) if notification was required under subsection (a) of this section, to reimburse an owner or purchaser for reasonable and necessary expenses (in an amount that is not more than the amount specified in the order of the Secretary under subsection (a)) incurred for repairing the defect or noncompliance during the period beginning on the date that notification was required to be issued and ending on the date the owner or purchaser receives the notification under this subsection.

    (d)  __Venue__  __.—__ 

    Notwithstanding [section 30163(c) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30163/c], a civil action about an order issued under [section 30118(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s30118/b] must be brought in the United States district court for a judicial district in the State in which the manufacturer is incorporated or the District of Columbia. On motion of a party, the court may transfer the action to another district court if good cause is shown. All actions related to the same order under section 30118(b) shall be consolidated in an action in one judicial district under an order of the court in which the first action was brought. If the first action is transferred to another court, that court shall issue the consolidation order.
