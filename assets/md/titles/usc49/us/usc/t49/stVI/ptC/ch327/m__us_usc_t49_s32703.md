    In clause (1), the words “the mileage the vehicle was driven, as registered by the odometer within the designed tolerance of the manufacturer of the odometer” are substituted for “the true mileage driven. For purposes of this section, the true mileage driven is that mileage driven by the vehicle as registered by the odometer within the manufacturer’s designed tolerance” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In clause (3), the words “public” and “road” are added for consistency in this subtitle.
