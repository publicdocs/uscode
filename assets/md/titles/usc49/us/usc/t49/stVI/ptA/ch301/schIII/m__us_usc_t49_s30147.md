    In this section, the words “(relating to discovery, notification, and remedy of motor vehicle defects)” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words “for a motor vehicle” are substituted for “in, or regarding, any motor vehicle” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(1)(B), the word “compliance” is substituted for “conformity” for consistency in this chapter.
