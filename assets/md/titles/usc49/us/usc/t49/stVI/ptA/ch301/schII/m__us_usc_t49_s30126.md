    The words “In order” are omitted as surplus. The words “United States Government” are substituted for “Congress” for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words “Therefore, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe uniform motor vehicle safety standards applicable to all used motor vehicles” are substituted for 15:1397(b)(1) (4th sentence) to eliminate unnecessary and executed words. The text of 15:1397(b)(1) (last sentence) is omitted as unnecessary because of 5:ch. 5, subch. II. The text of 15:1397(b)(1) (3d sentence) is omitted as executed.
