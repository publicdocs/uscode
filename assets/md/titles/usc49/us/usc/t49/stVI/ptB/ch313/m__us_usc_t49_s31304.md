        (2) has more than one driver’s license (except as allowed under [section 31302 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s31302]).

    (b) __Driver Violation Records.—__ 

        (1)  __Periodic review__  __.—__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (3), an employer shall ascertain the driving record of each driver it employs—

            (A) by making an inquiry at least once every 12 months to the appropriate State agency in which the driver held or holds a commercial driver’s license or permit during such time period;

            (B) by receiving occurrence-based reports of changes in the status of a driver’s record from 1 or more driver record notification systems that meet minimum standards issued by the Secretary; or

            (C) by a combination of inquiries to States and reports from driver record notification systems.

        (2)  __Record keeping__  __.—__ 

        A copy of the reports received under paragraph (1) shall be maintained in the driver’s qualification file.

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a driver employed by an employer who, in any 7-day period, is employed or used as a driver by more than 1 employer—

            (A) if the employer obtains the driver’s identification number, type, and issuing State of the driver’s commercial motor vehicle license; or
