    In clause (2), the words “section 33102(c)(1)” are substituted for “section 2022(d)(1)(B)” to correct an erroneous cross-reference. [Section 302(1) of the Act of October 25, 1992][/us/act/1992-10-25/s302/1] ([Public Law 102–519][/us/pl/102/519], [106 Stat. 3394][/us/stat/106/3394]), restated section 602(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act ([Public Law 92–513][/us/pl/92/513], [86 Stat. 947][/us/stat/86/947]) as section 602(d)(1) without making a corresponding change in the cross-reference restated in this section.

    In clause (3), the words “before January 1, 1990” are substituted for “before the beginning of the 2-year period specified in [section 2023(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s2023/a/1/A]” for clarity. See the revision notes for section 33104 of the revised title.

    In clause (5), the words “of motor vehicles” are added for consistency in this chapter.

    Clause (6)(I) is substituted for “rear quarter panels” for clarity and consistency.

    In clause (7)(A), the word “completed” is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.

    In clause (9), the words “after December 31, 1989” are substituted for “on or after the beginning of the 2-year period specified in [section 2023(a)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s2023/a/1/A]” for clarity and consistency.

 __[__  __Pub. L. 103–429, § 6(44)(A)__  __][/us/pl/103/429/s6/44/A]__ 

    This corrects a cross-reference in 49:33101(2) by eliminating the reference to 49:33102(c)(1). Section 302(1) of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 ([Public Law 102–519][/us/pl/102/519], [106 Stat. 3394][/us/stat/106/3394]) restated section 602(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act ([Public Law 92–513][/us/pl/92/513], [86 Stat. 947][/us/stat/86/947]) as section 602(d)(1) without making a change in the cross-reference in section 601(6) to section 602(d)(1)(B).

 __[__  __Pub. L. 103–429, § 6(44)(B)__  __][/us/pl/103/429/s6/44/B]__ 

    This makes a conforming amendment for consistency with the style of title 49.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–287][/us/pl/104/287] made technical amendment to directory language of [Pub. L. 103–429, § 6(44)(B)][/us/pl/103/429/s6/44/B]. See 1994 Amendment note below.

    1994—Par. (2). [Pub. L. 103–429, § 6(44)(B)][/us/pl/103/429/s6/44/B], as amended by [Pub. L. 104–287][/us/pl/104/287], inserted “of this title” before period at end.

    [Pub. L. 103–429, § 6(44)(A)][/us/pl/103/429/s6/44/A], substituted “section 33104” for “sections 33102(c)(1) and 33104”.

 __Effective Date of 1996 Amendment__ 

    [Pub. L. 104–287, § 6(d)][/us/pl/104/287/s6/d], Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3398][/us/stat/110/3398], provided that the amendment made by section 6(d)(1)(B) is effective Oct. 31, 1994.
