    In this section, language about whether a State law or regulation may be “in effect” is omitted as redundant to language about whether it may be “enforced”. The words “regulatory proceeding” are substituted for “rulemaking proceeding” for consistency in the revised title and because “rule” is synonymous with “regulation”.

    In subsection (a), the words “with respect to commercial motor vehicles” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b)(1), the words “Not later than 18 months after October 30, 1984, and . . . thereafter” are omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (g)(1), the words “court of appeals of the United States for the District of Columbia Circuit” are substituted for “United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia” to be more precise.

    In subsection (g)(2), the words “Upon the filing of a petition under paragraph (1) of this subsection” are omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (g)(3) is substituted for 49 App.:2507(g)(3) for consistency in this part and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (h), the text of 49 App.:2507(h) and the words “After the last day of the 48-month period beginning on October 30, 1984” are omitted as obsolete.

 __Amendments__

(f) to (h) as (e) to (g), respectively, and struck out heading and text of former subsec. (e).
