## § 33111. Verifications involving motor vehicle major parts

    (a)  __General Requirements__  __.—__ 

    A person engaged in the business of salvaging, dismantling, recycling, or repairing passenger motor vehicles may not knowingly sell in commerce or transfer or install a major part marked with an identification number without—

        (2)

         providing the purchaser or transferee with a verification—

            (A) identifying the vehicle identification number (or derivative of that number) of that major part; and

            (B) verifying that the major part has not been reported as stolen.

    (b)  __Nonapplication__  __.—__ 

        (1)

         Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a person that—

            (A) is the manufacturer of the major part;

            (B) has purchased the major part directly from the manufacturer; or

            (C) has received a verification from an insurance carrier under [section 33110 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s33110] that the motor vehicle from which the major part is derived has not been reported as stolen, or that the carrier has not established whether that vehicle has been stolen.

        (2) A person described under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection that subsequently transfers or sells in commerce the motor vehicle or a major part of the vehicle shall provide the verification received from the carrier to the person to whom the vehicle or part is transferred or sold.
