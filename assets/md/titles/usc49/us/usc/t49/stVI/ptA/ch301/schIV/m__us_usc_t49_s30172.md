        The term “original information” means information that—

            (A) is derived from the independent knowledge or analysis of an individual;

            (B) is not known to the Secretary from any other source, unless the individual is the original source of the information; and

            (C) is not exclusively derived from an allegation made in a judicial or an administrative action, in a governmental report, a hearing, an audit, or an investigation, or from the news media, unless the individual is a source of the information.

        (4)  __Part supplier__  __.—__ 

        The term “part supplier” means a manufacturer of motor vehicle equipment.

        The term “whistleblower” means any employee or contractor of a motor vehicle manufacturer, part supplier, or dealership who voluntarily provides to the Secretary original information relating to any motor vehicle defect, noncompliance, or any violation or alleged violation of any notification or reporting requirement of this chapter, which is likely to cause unreasonable risk of death or serious physical injury.

    (b) __Awards.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        If the original information that a whistleblower provided to the Secretary leads to the successful resolution of a covered action, the Secretary, subject to subsection (c), may pay an award or awards to one or more whistleblowers in an aggregate amount of—

            (A) not less than 10 percent, in total, of collected monetary sanctions; and

        (1) __Determination of awards.—__ 

            (A)  __Discretion__  __.—__ 

            The determination of whether, to whom, or in what amount to make an award shall be in the discretion of the Secretary subject to the provisions in subsection (b)(1).

            (B)  __Criteria__  __.—__ 

            In determining an award made under subsection (b), the Secretary shall take into consideration—

                (i) if appropriate, whether a whistleblower reported or attempted to report the information internally to an applicable motor vehicle manufacturer, part supplier, or dealership;

                (ii) the significance of the original information provided by the whistleblower to the successful resolution of the covered action;

                (iii) the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the covered action; and

                (iv) such additional factors as the Secretary considers relevant.

        (2)  __Denial of awards__  __.—__ 

        No award under subsection (b) shall be made—

            (A) to any whistleblower who is convicted of a criminal violation related to the covered action for which the whistleblower otherwise could receive an award under this section;

            (C) to any whistleblower who submits information to the Secretary that is based on the facts underlying the covered action submitted previously by another whistleblower;

            (D) to any whistleblower who fails to provide the original information to the Secretary in such form as the Secretary may require by regulation; or

            (E)

             if the applicable motor vehicle manufacturer, parts supplier, or dealership has an internal reporting mechanism in place to protect employees from retaliation, to any whistleblower who fails to report or attempt to report the information internally through such mechanism, unless—

                (i) the whistleblower reasonably believed that such an internal report would have resulted in retaliation, notwithstanding section 30171(a);

                (ii)

                 the whistleblower reasonably believed that the information—

                    (I) was already internally reported;

                    (II) was already subject to or part of an internal inquiry or investigation; or

                    (III) was otherwise already known to the motor vehicle manufacturer, part supplier, or dealership; or

                (iii) the Secretary has good cause to waive this requirement.

    (d)  __Representation__  __.—__
