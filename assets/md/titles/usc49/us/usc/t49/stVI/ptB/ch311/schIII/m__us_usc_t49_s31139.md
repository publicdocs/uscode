    (b)  __General Requirement and Minimum Amount__  __.—__

    (d)  __Requirements for Hazardous Matter and Oil__  __.—__ 

        (1)

                (iii) insurance of $5,000,000 is not readily available.

        (3)

         The level of financial responsibility established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for the transportation of a material, oil, substance, or waste not subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be at least $1,000,000. However, if the Secretary of Transportation finds it will not adversely affect public safety, the Secretary by regulation may reduce the amount for—

            (A) a class of vehicles transporting such a material, oil, substance, or waste in intrastate commerce (except in bulk); and

            (B) a farm vehicle transporting such a material or substance in interstate commerce (except in bulk).

    (e)  __Foreign Motor Carriers and Private Carriers__  __.—__

        (2) A person domiciled in a country contiguous to the United States and providing transportation to which a minimum level of financial responsibility under this section applies shall have evidence of financial responsibility in the motor vehicle when the person is providing the transportation. If evidence of financial responsibility is not in the vehicle, the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Treasury shall deny entry of the vehicle into the United States.

        (3) A motor carrier may obtain the required amount of financial responsibility from more than one source provided the cumulative amount is equal to the minimum requirements of this section.

    (g)  __Civil Penalty__  __.—__ 

        (1) If, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary of Transportation finds that a person (except an employee acting without knowledge) has knowingly violated this section or a regulation prescribed under this section, the person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.

        (2)

         The Secretary of Transportation shall impose the penalty by written notice. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Secretary shall consider—

            (A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;

            (B) with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue doing business; and

            (C) other matters that justice requires.

        (3) The Secretary of Transportation may compromise the penalty before referring the matter to the Attorney General for collection.

        (4) The Attorney General shall bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to collect a penalty referred to the Attorney General for collection under this subsection.

        (5) The amount of the penalty may be deducted from amounts the Government owes the person. An amount collected under this section shall be deposited in the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account).

    (h)  __Nonapplication__  __.—__ 

    This section does not apply to a motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 10,000 pounds if the vehicle is not used to transport in interstate or foreign commerce—

        (1) class A or B explosives;

        (2) poison gas; or
