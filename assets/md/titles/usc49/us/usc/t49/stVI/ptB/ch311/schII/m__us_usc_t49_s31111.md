Such combination may include one fullmount.

            (D) imposes a vehicle length limitation of not less than or more than 97 feet on all driveaway saddlemount vehicle transporter combinations;

            (E) has the effect of prohibiting the use of an existing semitrailer or trailer, of not more than 28.5 feet in length, in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination if the semitrailer or trailer was operating lawfully on December 1, 1982, within a 65-foot overall length limit in any State;

        (2) Before making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the chief executive officer shall consult with units of local government in the State in which the segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is located and with the chief executive officer of any adjacent State that may be directly affected by the exemption. As part of the consultations, consideration shall be given to any potential alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located and can safely accommodate a commercial motor vehicle having a length described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section or the motor vehicle combination described in subsection (c) of this section.

        (3) A chief executive officer’s notification under this subsection must include specific evidence of safety problems supporting the officer’s decision and the results of consultations about alternative routes.

        (4)

            (A) If the Secretary decides, on request of a chief executive officer or on the Secretary’s own initiative, a segment of the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways is not capable of safely accommodating a commercial motor vehicle having a length described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section or the motor vehicle combination described in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall exempt the segment from either or both of those provisions. Before making a decision under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider any possible alternative route that serves the area in which the segment is located.

            (B) The Secretary shall make a decision about a specific segment not later than 120 days after the date of receipt of notification from a chief executive officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the date on which the Secretary initiates action under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable.

            (C) Before making a decision, the Secretary shall give an interested person notice and an opportunity for comment. If the Secretary exempts a segment under this subsection before the final regulations under subsection (e) of this section are prescribed, the Secretary shall include the exemption as part of the final regulations. If the Secretary exempts the segment after the final regulations are prescribed, the Secretary shall publish the exemption as an amendment to the final regulations.

    (g)  __Accommodating Specialized Equipment__  __.—__ 

    In prescribing regulations to carry out this section, the Secretary may make decisions necessary to accommodate specialized equipment, including automobile and vessel transporters and maxi-cube vehicles.

    In this section, the words “Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways” are substituted for “National System of Interstate and Defense Highways” because of the Act of October 15, 1990 ([Public Law 101–427][/us/pl/101/427], [104 Stat. 927][/us/stat/104/927]).

    In subsection (a), the word “property” is substituted for “cargo” for consistency in the revised title.

    Subsection (b)(1) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(a) and (b) (2d–last sentences) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. Hyphens are used in describing the combinations “truck tractor-semitrailer” and “truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer” for consistency. In clause (D), the word “actually” is omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(b) (1st sentence) because of the restatement.

    In subsection (d), the words “such as rear view mirrors, turn signal lamps, marker lamps, steps and handholds for entry and egress, flexible fender extensions, mudflaps and splash and spray suppressant devices, load-induced tire bulge, refrigeration units or air compressors and other devices” are omitted as unnecessary and because most items listed relate to width rather than length.

    In subsection (e), the words “by regulation” are added for clarity. The words “subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section” are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:2311(e)(2) and (3) is omitted as executed.

    In subsection (f), the word “commercial” is added before “motor vehicle” for consistency.

    In subsection (f)(4)(C), the reference to regulations prescribed under subsection (e) is substituted for the reference in the source to regulations issued under subsection (a) to be more precise. The word “amendment” is substituted for “revision” for consistency in the revised title.

    Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(d) to eliminate unnecessary words. The Secretary’s general authority to prescribe regulations is provided in 49:322(a). The word “vessel” is substituted for “boat” because of 1:3. The text of 49 App.:2311(g) is omitted as executed.
