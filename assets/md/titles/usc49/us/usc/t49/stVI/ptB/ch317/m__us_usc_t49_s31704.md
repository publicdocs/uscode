## § 31704. Vehicle registration

    After September 30, 1996, a State that is not participating in the International Registration Plan may not establish, maintain, or enforce a commercial motor vehicle registration law, regulation, or agreement that limits the operation in that State of a commercial motor vehicle that is not registered under the laws of the State, if the vehicle is registered under the laws of a State participating in the Plan.

([Pub. L. 103–272, § 1(e)][/us/pl/103/272/s1/e], July 5, 1994, [108 Stat. 1032][/us/stat/108/1032].)

    The words “a State that is not participating in the International Registration Plan may not” are substituted for “no State (other than a State which is participating in the International Registration Plan) shall” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
