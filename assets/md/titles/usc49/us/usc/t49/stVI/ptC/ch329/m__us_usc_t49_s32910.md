    In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words “or their duly designated agents” are omitted as surplus because of 49:322(b) and section 3 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 (eff. Dec. 2, 1970, [84 Stat. 2089][/us/stat/84/2089]). In clause (A), the words “inspect and copy records of any person” are substituted for “require, by general or special orders, that any person . . . (B) provide . . . access to (and for the purpose of examination, the right to copy) any documentary evidence of such person” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “which is relevant to any functions of the Secretary or the EPA Administrator under this subchapter” are omitted as covered by “In carrying out this chapter”. In clause (B), the word “order” is substituted for “require, by general or special orders”, and the words “including reports or answers under oath” are substituted for “Such reports and answers shall be made under oath or otherwise”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “in such form as the Secretary or EPA Administrator may prescribe” and “shall be filed with the Secretary or the EPA Administrator within such reasonable period as either may prescribe” are omitted as surplus because of subsection (d) of this section and 49:322(a). The words “relating to any function of the Secretary or the EPA Administrator under this subchapter” are omitted as surplus. In clause (C), the words “sit and act at such times and places” are omitted as being included in “conduct hearings”. The words “subpena witnesses” are substituted for “require, by subpena, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “A civil action to enforce a subpena or order of the Secretary or Administrator under subsection (a) of this section may be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the proceeding by the Secretary or Administrator was conducted” are substituted for 15:2005(b)(2) (1st sentence) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), the words “to the public” are omitted as surplus. The words “However, the Secretary or the Administrator may withhold information” are substituted for “except that information may be withheld from disclosure” for clarity.

    Subsection (d) is added for convenience because throughout the chapter the Administrator is given authority to prescribe regulations to carry out duties of the Administrator.
