    In this chapter, the word “model” is substituted for “model type” for consistency in this part.

    In subsection (a)(3), before clause (A), the words “except as provided in [section 32908 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s32908]” are added for clarity. The word “line” is added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “or rails” are omitted because of 1:1. The text of 15:2001(1) (last sentence) is omitted because of 49:322(a). The text of 15:2001(13) and (14) is omitted as surplus because the complete names of the Secretary of Transportation and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are used the first time the terms appear in a section. The text of 15:2001 (related to 15:2011) is omitted because 15:2011 is outside the scope of the restatement. See section 4(c) of the bill.

    In subsection (a)(4), the words “ ‘automobile manufactured by a manufacturer’ includes” are substituted for “Any reference in this subchapter to automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer shall be deemed—(1) to include” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “every” is substituted for “all” because of the restatement. The words “but does not include” are substituted for “to exclude” for consistency. The words “manufactured by the person” are substituted for “manufactured (within the meaning of paragraph (1))” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(10), the words “in accordance with procedures established” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(14), the word “particular” is omitted as surplus.

    Subsection (a)(15)(B) is substituted for “If a manufacturer has no annual production period, the term ‘model year’ means the calendar year” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(16), before clause (A), the words “but does not include an automobile capable of off-highway operation that” are substituted for “(other than an automobile capable of off-highway operation)” and “The term ‘automobile capable of off-highway operation’ means any automobile which” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “The Secretary may prescribe regulations changing the percentage . . . to not less than 70 percent because of” are substituted for “but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for” for clarity and because of the restatement.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “For purposes of the definitions in paragraph (1)(D)” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words “within 18 months after October 14, 1988” are omitted as obsolete. The words “prescribe by regulation” are substituted for “establish by rule of general applicability” for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and because “rule” is synonymous with “regulation”. The words “that are passenger automobiles” are substituted for “The rule issued under this subparagraph shall apply only to dual fueled automobiles that are passenger automobiles” to eliminate unnecessary words.
