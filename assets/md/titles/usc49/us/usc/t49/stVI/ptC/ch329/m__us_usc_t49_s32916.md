    In subsection (a), the words “a report on the review by the Secretary” are substituted for “a review” for clarity. The words “beginning in 1977” and the text of 15:2002(a) (2d, last sentences) are omitted as executed.

    In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), reference to section 32904(b)(4) the 2d time it appears is substituted for “the amendment made to [section 2003(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s2003/b] by section 4(a)(1) of the Automobile Fuel Efficiency Act of 1980” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. Clause (B) is substituted for “achieves the purposes of that Act” for clarity.

    In subsection (b)(2), the reference to “subsection (a) of this section” is restated to refer to 15:2002(a) rather than 15:2012(a) to reflect the apparent intent of Congress. Although 15:2012(c)(2) refers to an annual report under 15:2012(a), that provision does not provide for an annual report.

 __[__  __Pub. L. 103–429__  __][/us/pl/103/429]__ 

    This makes conforming amendments necessary because of the restatement of 15:2003(b)(2)(G) as 49:32904(b)(3) by section 6(36)(B) of the bill.

 __References in Text__ 

    Paragraph (6) of [section 32904(b) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s32904/b], referred to in subsec. (b), was repealed by [Pub. L. 110–140, title I][/us/pl/110/140/tI], § 113(a), Dec. 19, 2007, [121 Stat. 1508][/us/stat/121/1508].

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–429][/us/pl/103/429], in par. (1), introductory provisions, substituted “32904(b)(6)” for “32904(b)(4)” in two places, in par. (1)(E), substituted “32904(b)(2)” for “32904(b)(1)(A)”, and in par. (2), substituted “32904(b)(6)” for “32904(b)(4)”.
