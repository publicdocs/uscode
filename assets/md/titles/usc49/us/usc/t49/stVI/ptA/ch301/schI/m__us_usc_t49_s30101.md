## § 30101. Purpose and policy

    The purpose of this chapter is to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents. Therefore it is necessary—

    (1) to prescribe motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in interstate commerce; and

    (2) to carry out needed safety research and development.

    The words “Congress hereby declares that”, “to persons”, and “Congress determines that” are omitted as surplus. The words “motor vehicle” before “equipment” are added for consistency. The words “and to expand the national driver register” are omitted because section 401 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 ([Public Law 89–563][/us/pl/89/563], [80 Stat. 730][/us/stat/80/730]), the only section in this law related to the national driver register, was superseded by the National Driver Register Act of 1982 ([Public Law 97–364][/us/pl/97/364], [96 Stat. 1740][/us/stat/96/1740]).
