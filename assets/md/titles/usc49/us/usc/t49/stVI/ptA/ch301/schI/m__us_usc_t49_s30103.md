## § 30103. Relationship to other laws

    (a)  __Uniformity of Regulations__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation may not prescribe a safety regulation related to a motor vehicle subject to subchapter I of chapter 135 of this title that differs from a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter. However, the Secretary may prescribe, for a motor vehicle operated by a carrier subject to subchapter I of chapter 135, a safety regulation that imposes a higher standard of performance after manufacture than that required by an applicable standard in effect at the time of manufacture.

    (b)  __Preemption__  __.—__ 

        (1) When a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter, a State or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter. However, the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the otherwise applicable standard under this chapter.

        (2) A State may enforce a standard that is identical to a standard prescribed under this chapter.

    (c)  __Antitrust Laws__  __.—__ 

    This chapter does not—

        (1) exempt from the antitrust laws conduct that is unlawful under those laws; or

        (2) prohibit under the antitrust laws conduct that is lawful under those laws.

    (d)  __Warranty Obligations and Additional Legal Rights and Remedies__  __.—__ 

    Sections 30117(b), 30118–30121, 30166(f), and 30167(a) and (b) of this title do not establish or affect a warranty obligation under a law of the United States or a State. A remedy under those sections and sections 30161 and 30162 of this title is in addition to other rights and remedies under other laws of the United States or a State.

    (e)  __Common Law Liability__  __.—__ 

    Compliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.

In subsection (a), the words “or the Transportation of Explosives Act, as amended ([18 U.S.C. 831–835][/us/usc/t18/s831–835])” are omitted as obsolete because 18:831–835 have been repealed.
