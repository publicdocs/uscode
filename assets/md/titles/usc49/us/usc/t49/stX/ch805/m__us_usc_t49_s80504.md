## § 80504. Medals of honor

    (a)  __Medals__  __.—__ 

    The President may prepare and give a bronze medal of honor with emblematic devices to an individual who by extreme daring endangers that individual’s life in trying to prevent, or save the life of another in, a grave accident in the United States involving a rail carrier providing transportation in interstate commerce or involving a motor vehicle on the public streets, roads, or highways. The President may give a medal only when sufficient evidence that the individual deserves the medal has been filed under regulations prescribed by the President.

    (b)  __Ribbons, Knots, and Rosettes__  __.—__ 

    The President may give an individual who receives a medal a ribbon to be worn with the medal and a knot or rosette to be worn in place of the medal. The President shall prescribe the design for the ribbon, knot, and rosette. If the ribbon is lost, destroyed, or made unfit for use and the individual receiving the medal is not negligent, the President shall issue a new ribbon without charge to the individual.

    (c)  __Availability of Appropriations__  __.—__ 

    Appropriations made to the Secretary of Transportation are available to carry out this section.

    In subsection (a), the words “may prepare and give” are substituted for “is authorized to cause to be prepared . . . which shall be bestowed” for clarity. The word “suitable” is omitted as surplus. The word “individual” is substituted for “persons” because it is more precise. The words “trying to prevent, or save the life of another in” are substituted for “in saving, or endeavoring to save, lives . . . or in preventing or endeavoring to prevent” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “grave accident” are substituted for “wreck, disaster, or grave accident” because they are inclusive. The words “rail carrier providing transportation in interstate commerce” are substituted for “railroad . . . engaged in interstate commerce” for consistency in the revised title. The words “The President may give a medal only when” are substituted for “Provided, That no award of said medal shall be made to any person until” for clarity. The word “filed” is substituted for “furnished and placed on file” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “and the individual receiving the medal is not negligent” are substituted for “without fault or neglect on the part of the person to whom it was issued” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “the President shall issue” are substituted for “shall be issued” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “to the Secretary of Transportation” are substituted for “for the Department of Transportation” because of 49:102(b).
