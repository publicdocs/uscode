In clause (1), the words “charges for storage, transportation, and delivery (including demurrage and terminal charges)” are substituted for “all charges on those goods for freight, storage, demurrage and terminal charges . . . and all other charges incurred in transportation and delivery” as being inclusive and to conform to section 7–307 of the Uniform Commercial Code. In clause (2), the words “other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien” are substituted for “unless the bill expressly enumerates other charges for which a lien . . . In such case there shall also be a lien for the charges enumerated” for clarity.
