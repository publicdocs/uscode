    In subsections (a)(1) and (b)(3), the word “compromise” is substituted for “remission or mitigation” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “in addition to another law” are substituted for “shall be construed to be supplemental to, and not to impair in any way, existing provisions of law” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “under this chapter” are substituted for “incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under the provisions of this chapter” to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the word “forfeiture” is substituted for “summary and judicial forfeiture” to eliminate unnecessary words.
