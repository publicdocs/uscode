## § 6103. Minimum standards for State one-call notification programs

    (a)  __Minimum Standards__  __.—__ 

    In order to qualify for a grant under section 6106, a State one-call notification program shall, at a minimum, provide for—

        (1) appropriate participation by all underground facility operators, including all government operators;

        (2) appropriate participation by all excavators, including all government and contract excavators; and

        (3) flexible and effective enforcement under State law with respect to participation in, and use of, one-call notification systems.

    (b)  __Appropriate Participation__  __.—__ 

    In determining the appropriate extent of participation required for types of underground facilities or excavators under subsection (a), a State shall assess, rank, and take into consideration the risks to the public safety, the environment, excavators, and vital public services associated with—

        (1) damage to types of underground facilities; and

        (2) activities of types of excavators.

    (c)  __Implementation__  __.—__ 

    A State one-call notification program also shall, at a minimum, provide for and document—

        (1) consideration of the ranking of risks under subsection (b) in the enforcement of its provisions;

        (2) a reasonable relationship between the benefits of one-call notification and the cost of implementing and complying with the requirements of the State one-call notification program; and

        (3) voluntary participation where the State determines that a type of underground facility or an activity of a type of excavator poses a de minimis risk to public safety or the environment.

    (d)  __Penalties__  __.—__ 

    To the extent the State determines appropriate and necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter, a State one-call notification program shall, at a minimum, provide for—

        (1) administrative or civil penalties commensurate with the seriousness of a violation by an excavator or facility owner of a State one-call notification program;

        (2) increased penalties for parties that repeatedly damage underground facilities because they fail to use one-call notification systems or for parties that repeatedly fail to provide timely and accurate marking after the required call has been made to a one-call notification system;

        (3) reduced or waived penalties for a violation of a requirement of a State one-call notification program that results in, or could result in, damage that is promptly reported by the violator;

        (4) equitable relief; and

        (5) citation of violations.
