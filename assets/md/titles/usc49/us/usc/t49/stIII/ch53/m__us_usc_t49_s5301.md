    In subsection (b)(4), the words “the early 1970’s” are substituted for “recent years” in 49 App.:1601b(4), and the words “minimal mass transportation service” are substituted for “this essential public service”, for clarity.

     In subsection (b)(5), the word “particularly” in 49 App.:1601b(5) is omitted as surplus.

In subsection (b)(6), the words “were . . . in the early 1970’s” are substituted for “now” in 49 App.:1601b(6) for clarity. The words “engaged in”, “actually”, and “comprehensive” in 49 App.:1601b(6) are omitted as surplus.

The words “the field of” and “(including the programs under this chapter) . . . contain provisions” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (e), the words “carrying out” are substituted for “construction of”, and the word “capital” is added, for consistency in the revised chapter.

>     “(a) __Findings.—__ 

>     The Congress finds that—

>         “(1) current Federal policy places commuter transit benefits at a disadvantage compared to drive-to-work benefits;

>         “(2) this Federal policy is inconsistent with important national policy objectives, including the need to conserve energy, reduce reliance on energy imports, lessen congestion, and clean our Nation’s air;

>         “(3) commuter transit benefits should be part of a comprehensive solution to national transportation and air pollution problems;

>         “(4) current Federal law allows employers to provide only up to $21 per month in employee benefits for transit or van pools;

>         “(5) the current ‘cliff provision’, which treats an entire commuter transit benefit as taxable income if it exceeds $21 per month, unduly penalizes the most effective employer efforts to change commuter behavior;

>         “(6) employer-provided commuter transit incentives offer many public benefits, including increased access of low-income persons to good jobs, inexpensive reduction of roadway and parking congestion, and cost-effective incentives for timely arrival at work; and

>         “(7) legislation to provide equitable treatment of employer-provided commuter transit benefits has been introduced with bipartisan support in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

>     “(b) __Policy.—__ 

>     The Congress strongly supports Federal policy that promotes increased use of employer-provided commuter transit benefits. Such a policy ‘levels the playing field’ between transportation modes and is consistent with important national objectives of energy conservation, reduced reliance on energy imports, lessened congestion, and clean air.”
