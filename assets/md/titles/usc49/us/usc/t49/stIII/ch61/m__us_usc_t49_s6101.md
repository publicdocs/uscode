## § 6101. Purposes

    The purposes of this chapter are—

    (1) to enhance public safety;

    (2) to protect the environment;

    (3) to minimize risks to excavators; and

    (4) to prevent disruption of vital public services,

    by reducing the incidence of damage to underground facilities during excavation through the voluntary adoption and efficient implementation by all States of State one-call notification programs that meet the minimum standards set forth under section 6103.

(Added [Pub. L. 105–178, title VII, § 7302(a)][/us/pl/105/178/s7302/a], June 9, 1998, [112 Stat. 478][/us/stat/112/478].)

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of duties, powers, and authority of Research and Special Programs Administration under this chapter to the Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, see [section 2(b) of Pub. L. 108–426][/us/pl/108/426/s2/b], set out as a note under [section 108 of this title][/us/usc/t49/s108].

 __Congressional Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 105–178, title VII, § 7301][/us/pl/105/178/s7301], June 9, 1998, [112 Stat. 477][/us/stat/112/477], provided that: 

> “Congress finds that—

>     “(1) unintentional damage to underground facilities during excavation is a significant cause of disruptions in telecommunications, water supply, electric power, and other vital public services, such as hospital and air traffic control operations, and is a leading cause of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline accidents;

>     “(2) excavation that is performed without prior notification to an underground facility operator or with inaccurate or untimely marking of such a facility prior to excavation can cause damage that results in fatalities, serious injuries, harm to the environment and disruption of vital services to the public; and

>     “(3) protection of the public and the environment from the consequences of underground facility damage caused by excavations will be enhanced by a coordinated national effort to improve one-call notification programs in each State and the effectiveness and efficiency of one-call notification systems that operate under such programs.”
