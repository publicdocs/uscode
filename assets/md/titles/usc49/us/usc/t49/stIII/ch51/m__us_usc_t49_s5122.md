In this section, the words “bring a civil action” are substituted for “bring an action in” in 49 App.:1810 and “petition . . . for an order . . . for such other order” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1808(a) (last sentence words after semicolon) and the words “for equitable relief” in 49 App.:1810(a) are omitted as surplus. The words “enforce this chapter” are substituted for “redress a violation by any person of a provision of this chapter” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “regulation prescribed or order issued” are substituted for “order or regulation issued” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words “The court may award appropriate relief, including” are substituted for “Such district courts shall have jurisdiction to determine such actions and may grant such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, and” to eliminate unnecessary words.
