    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “to convert a rail passenger terminal to an intermodal transportation terminal under [section 5562(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s5562/a/1]” are substituted for “for the purpose set forth in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection” for clarity and because of the restatement. In clause (5), the word “prescribed” is substituted for “develop and promulgate” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    Subsection (b) is substituted for “and such judgment is concurred in by consultants recommended by the Chairman of the National Endowment of \[sic\] the Arts and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and retained for this purpose by the Secretary” for clarity and consistency in the revised title.
