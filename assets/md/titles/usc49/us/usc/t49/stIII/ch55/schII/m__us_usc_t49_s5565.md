        (2) incorporate into the designs and plans proposed for converting the terminal, features that reasonably appear likely to attract private investors willing to carry out the planned conversion and its subsequent maintenance and operation; and

        (3) complete the designs and plans for the conversion within the period of time prescribed by the Secretary.

    (b) __Preference.—__ 

    In making a grant under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall give preferential consideration to an applicant whose completed designs and plans will be carried out within 3 years after their completion.

    (c) __Maximizing Conversion and Continued Public Use.—__ 

        (1)

         Amounts appropriated to carry out this section and [section 5562(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s5562/a/4] shall be expended in the way most likely to maximize the conversion and continued public use of rail passenger terminals that are—

            (A) listed in the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior; or

            (B) recommended (on the basis of architectural integrity and quality) by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation or the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.

        (2) The Secretary of Transportation may not make a grant under this section for more than 80 percent of the total cost of the project for which the financial assistance is provided.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word “authority” is substituted for “entity” for consistency in the revised title. The words “in accordance with regulations” are omitted as unnecessary because of 49:322(a). In clause (1), the words “as well as requirements . . . under this subsection” are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. In clause (2), the words “into an intermodal transportation terminal, a civic or cultural center, or both” are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (3), the word “prescribed” is substituted for “establishes” as being more appropriate.

    In subsection (b), the words “carried out” are substituted for “implemented and effectuated” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “The Secretary of Transportation may not make a grant” are substituted for “The amount of the Federal share of any grant . . . shall not exceed” for clarity and consistency in this chapter. The word “undertaking” is omitted as being included in “project”.
