    In this section, the words “governmental authorities” are substituted for “public bodies” because of section 5302(a) of the revised title.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “In addition to the grants and loans otherwise provided for under this chapter” are omitted as surplus. In clauses (1) and (2), the words “the specific purpose of” are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the words “or agencies thereof” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (b), the words “for expenditure”, “to the States”, and “amounts of a” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (d), the words “A recipient of amounts under this section” are added for clarity to correct an error in the source provisions. The words “under a contract, lease, or other arrangement” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (e), the words “terms, conditions . . . and provisions” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (e)(1), the words “and is deemed” are substituted for “and being considered for the purposes of all other laws” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

Section 3021(1) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 ([Public Law 102–240][/us/pl/102/240], [105 Stat. 2110][/us/stat/105/2110]) is applied to 49 App.:1612(e) to carry out the apparent intent of Congress.

    In subsection (g), the words “not later than 60 days following December 18, 1991” are omitted as obsolete. The words “and agencies” are omitted as surplus.
