## § 5114. Air transportation of ionizing radiation material

    (a)  __Transporting in Air Commerce__  __.—__ 

    Material that emits ionizing radiation spontaneously may be transported on a passenger-carrying aircraft in air commerce (as defined in [section 40102(a) of this title][/us/usc/t49/s40102/a]) only if the material is intended for a use in, or incident to, research or medical diagnosis or treatment and does not present an unreasonable hazard to health and safety when being prepared for, and during, transportation.

    (b)  __Procedures__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall prescribe procedures for monitoring and enforcing regulations prescribed under this section.

    (c)  __Nonapplication__  __.—__ 

    This section does not apply to material the Secretary decides does not pose a significant hazard to health or safety when transported because of its low order of radioactivity.
