    In this chapter, both sections 6 and 15 of the Amtrak Improvement Act ([Public Law 93–496][/us/pl/93/496], [88 Stat. 1528][/us/stat/88/1528], 1533) are listed as source credits for the addition of section 4(i) to the Department of Transportation Act ([Public Law 89–670][/us/pl/89/670], [80 Stat. 931][/us/stat/80/931]). This is done to conform to the probable intent of Congress as evidenced by the directory language of [section 15 of the Act of October 28, 1974][/us/act/1974-10-28/s15].

    In this section, the words “for community groups, convention visitors and others” are omitted as unnecessary.
