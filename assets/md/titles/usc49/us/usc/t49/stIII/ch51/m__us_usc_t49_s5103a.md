            Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Director of the Transportation Security Administration, after receiving comments from interested parties, shall develop and implement a process for notifying hazmat employers designated by an applicant of the results of the applicant’s background record check, if—

                (i) such notification is appropriate considering the potential security implications; and

                (ii) the Director, in a final notification of threat assessment, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Comma probably should appear after “applicant”. </sup></sup>  served on the applicant  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  determines that the applicant does not meet the standards set forth in regulations issued to carry out this section.

                (i) __Elimination of redundant checks.—__ 

                An individual with respect to whom the Transportation Security Administration—

                    (II) has issued a final notification of no security threat,

                 is deemed to have met the requirements of any other background check that is required for purposes of any Federal law applicable to transportation workers if that background check is equivalent to, or less stringent than, the background check required under this section.

                Not later than 60 days after the date of issuance of the report under paragraph (5), but no later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Director shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding, including notice and opportunity for comment, to determine which background checks required for purposes of Federal laws applicable to transportation workers are equivalent to, or less stringent than, those required under this section.

        If a State establishes its own standards for applicants for a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license, the State shall also provide—

            (A) an appeals process similar to and to the same extent as the process provided under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license by that State may appeal that denial; and

            (B) a waiver process similar to and to the same extent as the process provided under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license by that State may apply for a waiver.
