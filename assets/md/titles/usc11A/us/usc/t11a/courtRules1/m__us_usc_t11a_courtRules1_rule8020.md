### Rule 8020. Frivolous Appeal and Other Misconduct

    (a)  __Frivolous Appeal—Damages and Costs__  __.__ 

     If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.

    (b)  __Other Misconduct__  __.__ 

     The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or party appearing before it for other misconduct, including failure to comply with any court order. First, however, the court must afford the attorney or party reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8020, Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997, related to damages and costs for frivolous appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__

Subdivision (b) permits the district court or BAP to impose on parties as well as their counsel sanctions for misconduct other than taking a frivolous appeal. Failure to comply with a court order, for which sanctions may be imposed, may include a failure to comply with a local court rule.

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
