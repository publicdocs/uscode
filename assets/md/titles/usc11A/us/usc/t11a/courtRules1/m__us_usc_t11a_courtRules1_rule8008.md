### Rule 8008. Indicative Rulings

    (a)  __Relief Pending Appeal__  __.__ 

     If a party files a timely motion in the bankruptcy court for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the bankruptcy court may:

        (1) defer considering the motion; 

        (2) deny the motion; or

        (3) state that the court would grant the motion if the court where the appeal is pending remands for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue.

    (b)  __Notice to the Court Where the Appeal Is Pending__  __.__ 

     The movant must promptly notify the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

    (c)  __Remand After an Indicative Ruling__  __.__ 

     If the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the district court or BAP may remand for further proceedings, but it retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the district court or BAP remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the clerk of that court when the bankruptcy court has decided the motion on remand.

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8008, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 1996, eff. Dec. 1, 1996, related to filing and service, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is an adaptation of F.R.Civ.P. 62.1 and F.R.App.P. 12.1. It provides a procedure for the issuance of an indicative ruling when a bankruptcy court determines that, because of a pending appeal, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant a request for relief that the court concludes is meritorious or raises a substantial issue. The rule does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the bankruptcy court’s authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. In contrast, Rule 8002(b) identifies motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before the last such motion is resolved. In those circumstances, the bankruptcy court has authority to resolve the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.

    Subdivision (b) requires the movant to notify the court where an appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that it raises a substantial issue. This provision applies to appeals pending in the district court, the BAP, or the court of appeals.

    Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 6 and 12.1 govern the procedure in the court of appeals following notification of the bankruptcy court’s indicative ruling.

    Subdivision (c) of this rule governs the procedure in the district court or BAP upon notification that the bankruptcy court has issued an indicative ruling. The district court or BAP may remand to the bankruptcy court for a ruling on the motion for relief. The district court or BAP may also remand all proceedings, thereby terminating the initial appeal, if it expressly states that it is dismissing the appeal. It should do so, however, only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon the appeal. Otherwise, the district court or BAP may remand for the purpose of ruling on the motion, while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the appeal after the bankruptcy court rules, provided that the appeal is not then moot and a party wishes to proceed.

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
