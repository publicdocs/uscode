### Rule 8016. Cross-Appeals

    (a)  __Applicability__  __.__ 

     This rule applies to a case in which a cross-appeal is filed. Rules 8014(a)–(c), 8015(a)(7)(A)–(B), and 8018(a)(1)–(3) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise provided in this rule.

    (b)  __Designation of Appellant__  __.__ 

     The party who files a notice of appeal first is the appellant for purposes of this rule and Rule 8018(a)(4) and (b) and Rule 8019. If notices are filed on the same day, the plaintiff, petitioner, applicant, or movant in the proceeding below is the appellant. These designations may be modified by the parties’ agreement or by court order.

    (c)  __Briefs__  __.__ 

     In a case involving a cross-appeal:

        (1) Appellant’s Principal Brief. The appellant must file a principal brief in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a).

        (2) Appellee’s Principal and Response Brief. The appellee must file a principal brief in the cross-appeal and must, in the same brief, respond to the principal brief in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a), except that the brief need not include a statement of the case unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant’s statement.

        (3)

 Appellant’s Response and Reply Brief. The appellant must file a brief that responds to the principal brief in the cross-appeal and may, in the same brief, reply to the response in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellant is dissatisfied with the appellee’s statement in the cross-appeal:

            (A) the jurisdictional statement;

            (B) the statement of the issues and the applicable standard of appellate review; and

            (C) the statement of the case.

        (4) Appellee’s Reply Brief. The appellee may file a brief in reply to the response in the cross-appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(3) and (10) and must be limited to the issues presented by the cross-appeal.

    (d) __Length.__ 

        (1) Page Limitation. Unless it complies with paragraphs (2) and (3), the appellant’s principal brief must not exceed 30 pages; the appellee’s principal and response brief, 35 pages; the appellant’s response and reply brief, 30 pages; and the appellee’s reply brief, 15 pages.

        (2)

 Type-Volume Limitation.

            (A)

             The appellant’s principal brief or the appellant’s response and reply brief is acceptable if:

                (i) it contains no more than 14,000 words; or

                (ii) it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.

            (B)

             The appellee’s principal and response brief is acceptable if:

                (i) it contains no more than 16,500 words; or

                (ii) it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,500 lines of text.

            (C) The appellee’s reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more than half of the type volume specified in subparagraph (A).

            (D) Headings, footnotes, and quotations count toward the word and line limitations. The corporate disclosure statement, table of contents, table of citations, statement with respect to oral argument, any addendum containing statutes, rules, or regulations, and any certificates of counsel do not count toward the limitation.

        (3) Certificate of Compliance. A brief submitted either electronically or in paper form under paragraph (2) must comply with Rule 8015(a)(7)(C).

    (e)  __Time to Serve and File a Brief__  __.__ 

     Briefs must be served and filed as follows, unless the district court or BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:

        (1) the appellant’s principal brief, within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically;

        (2) the appellee’s principal and response brief, within 30 days after the appellant’s principal brief is served;

        (3) the appellant’s response and reply brief, within 30 days after the appellee’s principal and response brief is served; and

        (4) the appellee’s reply brief, within 14 days after the appellant’s response and reply brief is served, but at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district court or BAP, for good cause, allows a later filing.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8016, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991, related to duties of clerk of district court and bankruptcy appellate panel, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 28.1. It governs the timing, content, length, filing, and service of briefs in bankruptcy appeals in which there is a cross-appeal. The former Part VIII rules did not separately address the topic of cross-appeals. 

    Subdivision (b) prescribes which party is designated the appellant when there is a cross-appeal. Generally, the first to file a notice of appeal will be the appellant. 

    Subdivision (c) specifies the briefs that the appellant and the appellee may file. Because of the dual role of the parties to the appeal and cross-appeal, each party is permitted to file a principal brief and a response to the opposing party’s brief, as well as a reply brief. For the appellee, the principal brief in the cross-appeal and the response in the appeal are combined into a single brief. The appellant, on the other hand, initially files a principal brief in the appeal and later files a response to the appellee’s principal brief in the cross-appeal, along with a reply brief in the appeal. The final brief that may be filed is the appellee’s reply brief in the cross-appeal. 

    Subdivision (d), which prescribes page limits for briefs, is adopted from F.R.App.P. 28.1(e). It applies to briefs that are filed electronically, as well as to those filed in paper form. Like Rule 8015(a)(7), it imposes limits measured by either the number of pages or the number of words or lines of text. 

    Subdivision (e) governs the time for filing briefs in cases in which there is a cross-appeal. It adapts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 28.1(f).

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (d)(2)(D) was added, and subdivision (f) was deleted. In subdivision (a), the statement that Rule 8018(a) does not apply was changed to refer to Rule 8018(a)(1)–(3). In subdivision (b), Rule 8018(a)(4) was added to the list of rules. Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
