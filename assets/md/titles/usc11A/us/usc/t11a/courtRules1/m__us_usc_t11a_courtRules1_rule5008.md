### Rule 5008. Notice Regarding Presumption of Abuse in Chapter 7 Cases of Individual Debtors

    If a presumption of abuse has arisen under § 707(b) in a chapter 7 case of an individual with primarily consumer debts, the clerk shall within 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition notify creditors of the presumption of abuse in accordance with Rule 2002. If the debtor has not filed a statement indicating whether a presumption of abuse has arisen, the clerk shall within 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition notify creditors that the debtor has not filed the statement and that further notice will be given if a later filed statement indicates that a presumption of abuse has arisen. If a debtor later files a statement indicating that a presumption of abuse has arisen, the clerk shall notify creditors of the presumption of abuse as promptly as practicable.

(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991__ 

    This rule \[Rule 5008. Funds of the Estate; abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991\] is abrogated in view of the amendments to § 345(b) of the Code and the role of the United States trustee in approving bonds and supervising trustees.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2008__ 

    This rule is new. The 2005 amendments to § 342 of the Code require that clerks give written notice to all creditors not later than 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition that a presumption of abuse has arisen under § 707(b). A statement filed by the debtor will be the source of the clerk’s information about the presumption of abuse. This rule enables the clerk to meet its obligation to send the notice within the statutory time period set forth in § 342. In the event that the court receives the debtor’s statement after the clerk has sent the first notice, and the debtor’s statement indicates a presumption of abuse, the rule requires that the clerk send a second notice.

    Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
