### Rule 2010. Qualification by Trustee; Proceeding on Bond

    (a) __Blanket Bond. The United States trustee may authorize a blanket bond in favor of the United States conditioned on the faithful performance of official duties by the trustee or trustees to cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies in a different case.__ 

    (b) __Proceeding on Bond. A proceeding on the trustee’s bond may be brought by any party in interest in the name of the United States for the use of the entity injured by the breach of the condition.__ 

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    Subdivisions (a) and (b). Subdivision (a) gives authority for approval by the court of a single bond to cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies in a different case. The cases need not be related in any way. Substantial economies can be effected if a single bond covering a number of different cases can be issued and approved at one time. When a blanket bond is filed, the trustee qualifies under subdivision (b) of the rule by filing an acceptance of the office.

    Subdivision (c) prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certified copy of an order approving the trustee’s bond given by a trustee under this rule or, when a blanket bond has been authorized, of a certified copy of acceptance. This rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply in bankruptcy cases. See Rule 1101 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The order of approval should conform to Official Form No. 25. See, however, § 549(c) of the Code which provides only for the filing of the petition in the real estate records to serve as constructive notice of the pendency of the case. See also Rule 2011 which prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate that the debtor is a debtor in possession.

    Subdivision (d) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 212(f). Reference should be made to § 322(a) and (d) of the Code which requires the bond to be filed with the bankruptcy court and places a two year limitation for the commencement of a proceeding on the bond. A bond filed under this rule should conform to Official Form No. 25. A proceeding on the bond of a trustee is governed by the rules in Part VII. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001. See also Rule 9025.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (b) is deleted because of the amendment to Rule 2008.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment of § 322 of the Code. The United States trustee determines the amount and sufficiency of the trustee’s bond. The amendment to subdivision (a) is derived from Rule X–1004(b).

    Subdivision (b) is abrogated because an order approving a bond is no longer necessary in view of the 1986 amendments to § 322 of the Code. Subdivision (c) is redesignated as subdivision (b).
