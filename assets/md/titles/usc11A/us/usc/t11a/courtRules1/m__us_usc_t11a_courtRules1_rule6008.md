### Rule 6008. Redemption of Property from Lien or Sale

    On motion by the debtor, trustee, or debtor in possession and after hearing on notice as the court may direct, the court may authorize the redemption of property from a lien or from a sale to enforce a lien in accordance with applicable law.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 609. No provision in the Code addresses the trustee’s right of redemption. Ordinarily the secured creditor should be given notice of the trustee’s motion so that any objection may be raised to the proposed redemption.

    The rule applies also to a debtor exercising a right of redemption pursuant to § 722. A proceeding under that section is governed by Rule 9014.
