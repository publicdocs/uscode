### Rule 8013. Motions; Intervention

    (a) __Contents of a Motion; Response; Reply.__ 

        (1) Request for Relief. A request for an order or other relief is made by filing a motion with the district or BAP clerk, with proof of service on the other parties to the appeal.

        (2)

 Contents of a Motion.

            (A) Grounds and the Relief Sought. A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.

            (B) Motion to Expedite an Appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal must explain what justifies considering the appeal ahead of other matters. If the district court or BAP grants the motion, it may accelerate the time to transmit the record, the deadline for filing briefs and other documents, oral argument, and the resolution of the appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal may be filed as an emergency motion under subdivision (d).

            (C)

 Accompanying Documents.

                (i) Any affidavit or other document necessary to support a motion must be served and filed with the motion.

                (ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.

                (iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the bankruptcy court’s judgment, order, or decree, and any accompanying opinion as a separate exhibit.

            (D)

 Documents Barred or Not Required.

                (i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.

                (ii) Unless the court orders otherwise, a notice of motion or a proposed order is not required.

        (3)

 Response and Reply; Time to File. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise,

            (A) any party to the appeal may file a response to the motion within 7 days after service of the motion; and

            (B) the movant may file a reply to a response within 7 days after service of the response, but may only address matters raised in the response.

    (b)  __Disposition of a Motion for a Procedural Order__  __.__ 

     The district court or BAP may rule on a motion for a procedural order—including a motion under Rule 9006(b) or (c)—at any time without awaiting a response. A party adversely affected by the ruling may move to reconsider, vacate, or modify it within 7 days after the procedural order is served.

    (c)  __Oral Argument__  __.__ 

     A motion will be decided without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.

    (d) __Emergency Motion.__ 

        (1)  __Noting the Emergency__  __.__ 

         When a movant requests expedited action on a motion because irreparable harm would occur during the time needed to consider a response, the movant must insert the word “Emergency” before the title of the motion.

        (2)

 Contents of the Motion. The emergency motion must

            (A) be accompanied by an affidavit setting out the nature of the emergency;

            (B) state whether all grounds for it were submitted to the bankruptcy court and, if not, why the motion should not be remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider;

            (C) include the e-mail addresses, office addresses, and telephone numbers of moving counsel and, when known, of opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties to the appeal; and

            (D) be served as prescribed by Rule 8011.

        (3) Notifying Opposing Parties. Before filing an emergency motion, the movant must make every practicable effort to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in time for them to respond. The affidavit accompanying the emergency motion must state when and how notice was given or state why giving it was impracticable.

    (e) __Power of a Single BAP Judge to Entertain a Motion.__ 

        (1) Single Judge’s Authority. A BAP judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal, deny a motion for leave to appeal, or deny a motion for a stay pending appeal if denial would make the appeal moot.

        (2) Reviewing a Single Judge’s Action. The BAP may review a single judge’s action, either on its own motion or on a party’s motion.

    (f) __Form of Documents; Page Limits; Number of Copies.__ 

        (1) Format of a Paper Document. Rule 27(d)(1) F.R.App.P. applies in the district court or BAP to a paper version of a motion, response, or reply.

        (2) Format of an Electronically Filed Document. A motion, response, or reply filed electronically must comply with the requirements for a paper version regarding covers, line spacing, margins, typeface, and type style. It must also comply with the page limits under paragraph (3).

        (3)

 Page Limits. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise:

            (A) a motion or a response to a motion must not exceed 20 pages, exclusive of the corporate disclosure statement and accompanying documents authorized by subdivision (a)(2)(C); and

            (B) a reply to a response must not exceed 10 pages.

        (4) Paper Copies. Paper copies must be provided only if required by local rule or by an order in a particular case.

    (g)  __Intervening in an Appeal__  __.__ 

     Unless a statute provides otherwise, an entity that seeks to intervene in an appeal pending in the district court or BAP must move for leave to intervene and serve a copy of the motion on the parties to the appeal. The motion or other notice of intervention authorized by statute must be filed within 30 days after the appeal is docketed. It must concisely state the movant’s interest, the grounds for intervention, whether intervention was sought in the bankruptcy court, why intervention is being sought at this stage of the proceeding, and why participating as an amicus curiae would not be adequate.

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8013, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related to disposition of appeal and weight accorded bankruptcy judge’s findings of fact, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from former Rule 8011 and F.R.App.P. 15(d) and 27. It adopts many of the provisions of the appellate rules that specify the form and page limits of motions and accompanying documents, while also adjusting those requirements for electronic filing. In addition, it prescribes the procedure for seeking to intervene in the district court or BAP. 

    Subdivision (a) retains much of the content of former Rule 8011(a) regarding the contents of a motion, response, and reply. It also specifies the documents that may accompany a motion. Unlike the former rule, which allowed the filing of separate briefs supporting a motion, subdivision (a) now adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 27(a) of prohibiting the filing of briefs supporting or responding to a motion. The motion or response itself must include the party’s legal arguments. 

    Subdivision (a)(2)(B) clarifies the procedure for seeking to expedite an appeal. A motion under this provision seeks to expedite the time for the disposition of the appeal as a whole, whereas an emergency motion—which is addressed by subdivision (d)—typically involves an urgent request for relief short of disposing of the entire appeal (for example, an emergency request for a stay pending appeal to prevent imminent mootness). In appropriate cases—such as when there is an urgent need to resolve the appeal quickly to prevent harm—a party may file a motion to expedite the appeal as an emergency motion. 

    Subdivision (b) retains the substance of former Rule 8011(b). It authorizes the district court or BAP to act on a motion for a procedural order without awaiting a response to the motion. It specifies that a party seeking reconsideration, vacation, or modification of the order must file a motion within 7 days after service of the order. 

    Subdivision (c) continues the practice of former Rule 8011(c) and F.R.App.P. 27(e) of dispensing with oral argument of motions in the district court or BAP unless the court orders otherwise. 

    Subdivision (d), which carries forward the content of former Rule 8011(d), governs emergency motions that the district court or BAP may rule on without awaiting a response when necessary to prevent irreparable harm. A party seeking expedited action on a motion in the district court or BAP must explain the nature of the emergency, whether all grounds in support of the motion were first presented to the bankruptcy court, and, if not, why the district court or BAP should not remand for reconsideration. The moving party must also explain the steps taken to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in advance of filing the emergency motion and, if they were not notified, why it was impracticable to do so. 

    Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8011(e) and similar to F.R.App.P. 27(c), authorizes a single BAP judge to rule on certain motions. This authority, however, does not extend to issuing rulings that would dispose of the appeal. For that reason, the rule now prohibits a single BAP judge from denying a motion for a stay pending appeal when the effect of that ruling would be to require dismissal of the appeal as moot. A ruling by a single judge is subject to review by the BAP. 

    Subdivision (f) incorporates by reference the formatting and appearance requirements of F.R.App.P. 27(d)(1). When paper versions of the listed documents are filed, they must comply with the requirements of the specified rules regarding reproduction, covers, binding, appearance, and format. When these documents are filed electronically, they must comply with the relevant requirements of the specified rules regarding covers and format. Subdivision (f) also specifies page limits for motions, responses, and replies, which is a matter that former Rule 8011 did not address. 

    Subdivision (g) clarifies the procedure for seeking to intervene in a proceeding that has been appealed. It is based on F.R.App.P. 15(d), but it also requires the moving party to explain why intervention is being sought at the appellate stage. The former Part VIII rules did not address intervention.

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(2)(D) was changed to allow the court to require a notice of motion or proposed order. A stylistic change was made to subdivision (d)(2)(B).
