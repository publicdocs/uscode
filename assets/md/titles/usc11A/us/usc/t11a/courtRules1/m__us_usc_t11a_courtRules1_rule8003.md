### Rule 8003. Appeal as of Right—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal

    (a) __Filing the Notice of Appeal.__ 

        (1) In General. An appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a district court or BAP under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1) or (a)(2) may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002.

        (2) Effect of Not Taking Other Steps. An appellant’s failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the district court or BAP to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.

        (3)

 Contents. The notice of appeal must:

            (A) conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form;

            (B) be accompanied by the judgment, order, or decree, or the part of it, being appealed; and

            (C) be accompanied by the prescribed fee.

        (4) Additional Copies. If requested to do so, the appellant must furnish the bankruptcy clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with subdivision (c).

    (b) __Joint or Consolidated Appeals.__ 

        (1) Joint Notice of Appeal. When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.

        (2) Consolidating Appeals. When parties have separately filed timely notices of appeal, the district court or BAP may join or consolidate the appeals.

    (c) __Serving the Notice of Appeal.__ 

        (1) Serving Parties and Transmitting to the United States Trustee. The bankruptcy clerk must serve the notice of appeal on counsel of record for each party to the appeal, excluding the appellant, and transmit it to the United States trustee. If a party is proceeding pro se, the clerk must send the notice of appeal to the party’s last known address. The clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.

        (2) Effect of Failing to Serve or Transmit Notice. The bankruptcy clerk’s failure to serve notice on a party or transmit notice to the United States trustee does not affect the validity of the appeal.

        (3) Noting Service on the Docket. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties served and the date and method of the service.

    (d) __Transmitting the Notice of Appeal to the District Court or BAP; Docketing the Appeal.__ 

        (1) Transmitting the Notice. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice to the district clerk.

        (2)Docketing in the District Court or BAP. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant’s name if necessary.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8003, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to leave to appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from several former Bankruptcy Rule and Appellate Rule provisions. It addresses appeals as of right, joint and consolidated appeals, service of the notice of appeal, and the timing of the docketing of an appeal in the district court or BAP.

    Subdivision (a) incorporates, with stylistic changes, much of the content of former Rule 8001(a) regarding the taking of an appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1) or (2). The rule now requires that the judgment, order, or decree being appealed be attached to the notice of appeal.

    Subdivision (b), which is an adaptation of F.R.App.P. 3(b), permits the filing of a joint notice of appeal by multiple appellants that have sufficiently similar interests that their joinder is practicable. It also allows the district court or BAP to consolidate appeals taken separately by two or more parties.

    Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8004 and F.R.App.P. 3(d). Under Rule 8001(c), the former rule’s requirement that service of the notice of appeal be accomplished by mailing is generally modified to require that the bankruptcy clerk serve counsel by electronic means. Service on pro se parties must be made by sending the notice to the address most recently provided to the court.

    Subdivision (d) modifies the provision of former Rule 8007(b), which delayed the docketing of an appeal by the district court or BAP until the record was complete and the bankruptcy clerk transmitted it. The new provision, adapted from F.R.App.P. 3(d) and 12(a), requires the bankruptcy clerk to promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Under this procedure, motions filed in the district court or BAP prior to completion and transmission of the record can generally be placed on the docket of an already pending appeal.

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (d)(2), the direction for docketing a bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. Stylistic changes were made to subdivision (c)(1). Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
