### Rule 8022. Motion for Rehearing

    (a) __Time to File; Contents; Response; Action by the District Court or BAP if Granted.__ 

        (1) Time. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, any motion for rehearing by the district court or BAP must be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal.

        (2) Contents. The motion must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the movant believes the district court or BAP has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the motion. Oral argument is not permitted.

        (3) Response. Unless the district court or BAP requests, no response to a motion for rehearing is permitted. But ordinarily, rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request.

        (4)

 Action by the District Court or BAP. If a motion for rehearing is granted, the district court or BAP may do any of the following:

            (A) make a final disposition of the appeal without reargument;

            (B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or

            (C) issue any other appropriate order.

    (b)  __Form of the Motion; Length__  __.__ 

     The motion must comply in form with Rule 8013(f)(1) and (2). Copies must be served and filed as provided by Rule 8011. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, a motion for rehearing must not exceed 15 pages.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from former Rule 8015 and F.R.App.P. 40. It deletes the provision of former Rule 8015 regarding the time for appeal to the court of appeals because the matter is addressed by F.R.App.P. 6(b)(2)(A).

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (b), the reference to local rule was deleted as unnecessary.
