### Rule 8021. Costs

    (a)  __Against Whom Assessed__  __.__ 

     The following rules apply unless the law provides or the district court or BAP orders otherwise:

        (1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree otherwise;

        (2) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;

        (3) if a judgment, order, or decree is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;

        (4) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed or reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the district court or BAP orders.

    (b)  __Costs For and Against the United States__  __.__ 

     Costs for or against the United States, its agency, or its officer may be assessed under subdivision (a) only if authorized by law.

    (c)  __Costs on Appeal Taxable in the Bankruptcy Court__  __.__ 

     The following costs on appeal are taxable in the bankruptcy court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:

        (1) the production of any required copies of a brief, appendix, exhibit, or the record;

        (2) the preparation and transmission of the record;

        (3) the reporter’s transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;

        (4) premiums paid for a supersedeas bond or other bonds to preserve rights pending appeal; and

        (5) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.

    (d)  __Bill of Costs; Objections__  __.__ 

     A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal, file with the bankruptcy clerk, with proof of service, an itemized and verified bill of costs. Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the bankruptcy court extends the time.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from former Rule 8014 and F.R.App.P. 39. It retains the former rule’s authorization for taxing appellate costs against the losing party and its specification of the costs that may be taxed. The rule also incorporates some of the additional details regarding the taxing of costs contained in F.R.App.P. 39. Consistent with former Rule 8014, the bankruptcy clerk has the responsibility for taxing all costs. Subdivision (b), derived from F.R.App.P. 39(b), clarifies that additional authority is required for the taxation of costs by or against federal governmental parties. 

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
