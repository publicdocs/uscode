### Rule 5007. Record of Proceedings and Transcripts

     (a)  __Filing of Record or Transcript__  __.__ 

     The reporter or operator of a recording device shall certify the original notes of testimony, tape recording, or other original record of the proceeding and promptly file them with the clerk. The person preparing any transcript shall promptly file a certified copy.

    (b)  __Transcript Fees__  __.__ 

     The fees for copies of transcripts shall be charged at rates prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. No fee may be charged for the certified copy filed with the clerk.

    (c)  __Admissibility of Record in Evidence__  __.__ 

     A certified sound recording or a transcript of a proceeding shall be admissible as prima facie evidence to establish the record.

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule supplements 28 U.S.C. § 773. A record of proceedings before the bankruptcy judge is to be made whenever practicable. By whatever means the record is made, subdivision (a) requires that the preparer of the record certify and file the original notes, tape recording, or other form of sound recording of the proceedings. Similarly, if a transcript is requested, the preparer is to file a certified copy with the clerk.

    Subdivision (b) is derived from 28 U.S.C. § 753(f).

    Subdivision (c) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 511(c). This subdivision extends to a sound recording the same evidentiary status as a transcript under 28 U.S.C. § 773(b).

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    The words “with the clerk” in the final sentence of subdivision (a) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
