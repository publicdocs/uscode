### Rule 1016. Death or Incompetency of Debtor

    Death or incompetency of the debtor shall not abate a liquidation case under chapter 7 of the Code. In such event the estate shall be administered and the case concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred. If a reorganization, family farmer’s debt adjustment, or individual’s debt adjustment case is pending under chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13, the case may be dismissed; or if further administration is possible and in the best interest of the parties, the case may proceed and be concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred.

(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule is derived from former Rules 118 and 11–16. In a chapter 11 reorganization case or chapter 13 individual’s debt adjustment case, the likelihood is that the case will be dismissed.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to conform to 25 F.R.Civ.P. and to include chapter 12 cases.
