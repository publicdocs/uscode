### Rule 9003. Prohibition of Ex Parte Contacts

    (a) __General Prohibition. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, any examiner, any party in interest, and any attorney, accountant, or employee of a party in interest shall refrain from ex parte meetings and communications with the court concerning matters affecting a particular case or proceeding.__ 

    (b) __United States Trustee. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, the United States trustee and assistants to and employees or agents of the United States trustee shall refrain from ex parte meetings and communications with the court concerning matters affecting a particular case or proceeding. This rule does not preclude communications with the court to discuss general problems of administration and improvement of bankruptcy administration, including the operation of the United States trustee system.__ 

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule regulates the actions of parties in interest and their attorneys or others employed by parties in interest. This regulation of the conduct of parties in interest and their representative is designed to insure that the bankruptcy system operates fairly and that no appearance of unfairness is created. See H. Rep. No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 95 et seq. (1977).

    This rule is not a substitute for or limitation of any applicable canon of professional responsibility or judicial conduct. See, e.g., Canon 7, EC7–35, Disciplinary Rule 7–110(B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility: “Generally, in adversary proceedings a lawyer should not communicate with a judge relative to a matter pending before, or which is to be brought before, a tribunal over which he presides in circumstances which might have the effect or give the appearance of granting undue advantage to one party;” and Canon 3A(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct: “A judge should . . . neither initiate nor consider ex parte or other communications concerning a pending or impending proceeding.”

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to apply to both the bankruptcy judges and the district judges of the district.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (a) is amended to extend to examiners the prohibition on ex parte meetings and communications with the court.

    Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule X–1010.
