### Rule 8015. Form and Length of Briefs; Form of Appendices and Other Papers 

    (a)  __Paper Copies of a Brief__  __.__ 

     If a paper copy of a brief may or must be filed, the following provisions apply:

        (1)

 Reproduction.

            (A) A brief may be reproduced by any process that yields a clear black image on light paper. The paper must be opaque and unglazed. Only one side of the paper may be used.

            (B) Text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer.

            (C) Photographs, illustrations, and tables may be reproduced by any method that results in a good copy of the original. A glossy finish is acceptable if the original is glossy.

        (2)

 Cover. The front cover of a brief must contain:

            (A) the number of the case centered at the top;

            (B) the name of the court;

            (C) the title of the case as prescribed by Rule 8003(d)(2) or 8004(c)(2);

            (D) the nature of the proceeding and the name of the court below;

            (E) the title of the brief, identifying the party or parties for whom the brief is filed; and

            (F) the name, office address, telephone number, and e-mail address of counsel representing the party for whom the brief is filed.

        (3) Binding. The brief must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the text, and permits the brief to lie reasonably flat when open.

        (4) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The brief must be on 8½-by-11 inch paper. The text must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.

        (5)

 Typeface. Either a proportionally spaced or monospaced face may be used.

            (A) A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type may be used in headings and captions. A proportionally spaced face must be 14-point or larger.

            (B) A monospaced face may not contain more than 10½ characters per inch.

        (6) Type Styles. A brief must be set in plain, roman style, although italics or boldface may be used for emphasis. Case names must be italicized or underlined.

        (7)

 Length.

            (A) Page limitation. A principal brief must not exceed 30 pages, or a reply brief 15 pages, unless it complies with (B) and (C).

            (B)

 Type-volume limitation.

                (i) A principal brief is acceptable if:    • it contains no more than 14,000 words; or

                    • it uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.

                (ii) A reply brief is acceptable if it contains no more than half of the type volume specified in item (i).

                (iii) Headings, footnotes, and quotations count toward the word and line limitations. The corporate disclosure statement, table of contents, table of citations, statement with respect to oral argument, any addendum containing statutes, rules, or regulations, and any certificates of counsel do not count toward the limitation.

            (C)

 Certificate of Compliance.

                (i) A brief submitted under subdivision (a)(7)(B) must include a certificate signed by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, that the brief complies with the type-volume limitation. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word or line count of the word-processing system used to prepare the brief. The certificate must state either:    • the number of words in the brief; or

                    • the number of lines of monospaced type in the brief.

                (ii) The certification requirement is satisfied by a certificate of compliance that conforms substantially to the appropriate Official Form.

    (b)  __Electronically Filed Briefs__  __.__ 

     A brief filed electronically must comply with subdivision (a), except for (a)(1), (a)(3), and the paper requirement of (a)(4).

    (c)  __Paper Copies of Appendices__  __.__ 

     A paper copy of an appendix must comply with subdivision (a)(1), (2), (3), and (4), with the following exceptions:

        (1) An appendix may include a legible photocopy of any document found in the record or of a printed decision.

        (2) When necessary to facilitate inclusion of odd-sized documents such as technical drawings, an appendix may be a size other than 8½-by-11 inches, and need not lie reasonably flat when opened.

    (d)  __Electronically Filed Appendices__  __.__ 

     An appendix filed electronically must comply with subdivision (a)(2) and (4), except for the paper requirement of (a)(4).

    (e) __Other Documents.__ 

        (1) Motion. Rule 8013(f) governs the form of a motion, response, or reply.

        (2)

 Paper Copies of Other Documents. A paper copy of any other document, other than a submission under Rule 8014(f), must comply with subdivision (a), with the following exceptions:

            (A) A cover is not necessary if the caption and signature page together contain the information required by subdivision (a)(2).

            (B) Subdivision (a)(7) does not apply.

        (3) Other Documents Filed Electronically. Any other document filed electronically, other than a submission under Rule 8014(f), must comply with the appearance requirements of paragraph (2).

    (f)  __Local Variation__  __.__ 

     A district court or BAP must accept documents that comply with the applicable requirements of this rule. By local rule, a district court or BAP may accept documents that do not meet all of the requirements of this rule.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8015, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to motion for rehearing, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived primarily from F.R.App.P. 32. Former Rule 8010(c) prescribed page limits for principal briefs and reply briefs. Those limits are now addressed by subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. In addition, the rule incorporates most of the detail of F.R.App.P. 32 regarding the appearance and format of briefs, appendices, and other documents, along with new provisions that apply when those documents are filed electronically. 

    Subdivision (a) prescribes the form requirements for briefs that are filed in paper form. It incorporates F.R.App.P. 32(a), except it does not include color requirements for brief covers, it requires the cover of a brief to include counsel’s e-mail address, and cross-references to the appropriate bankruptcy rules are substituted for references to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. 

    Subdivision (a)(7) decreases the length of briefs, as measured by the number of pages, that was permitted by former Rule 8010(c). Page limits are reduced from 50 to 30 pages for a principal brief and from 25 to 15 for a reply brief in order to achieve consistency with F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7). But as permitted by the appellate rule, subdivision (a)(7) also permits the limits on the length of a brief to be measured by a word or line count, as an alternative to a page limit. Basing the calculation of brief length on either of the type-volume methods specified in subdivision (a)(7)(B) will result in briefs that may exceed the designated page limits in (a)(7)(A) and that may be approximately as long as allowed by the prior page limits. 

    Subdivision (b) adapts for briefs that are electronically filed subdivision (a)’s form requirements. With the use of electronic filing, the method of reproduction, method of binding, and use of paper become irrelevant. But information required on the cover, formatting requirements, and limits on brief length remain the same. 

    Subdivisions (c) and (d) prescribe the form requirements for appendices. Subdivision (c), applicable to paper appendices, is derived from F.R.App.P. 32(b), and subdivision (d) adapts those requirements for electronically filed appendices. 

    Subdivision (e), which is based on F.R.App.P. 32(c), addresses the form required for documents—in paper form or electronically filed—that these rules do not otherwise cover.

    Subdivision (f), like F.R.App.P. 32(e), provides assurance to lawyers and parties that compliance with this rule’s form requirements will allow a brief or other document to be accepted by any district court or BAP. A court may, however, by local rule or, under Rule 8028 by order in a particular case, choose to accept briefs and documents that do not comply with all of this rule’s requirements. The decision whether to accept a brief that appears not to be in compliance with the rules must be made by the court. Under Rule 8011(a)(3), the clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rule or practice. 

    Under Rule 8011(e), the party filing the document or, if represented, its counsel must sign all briefs and other submissions. If the document is filed electronically, an electronic signature must be provided in accordance with Rule 8011(e). 

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (f), “or order in a particular case” was deleted as unnecessary. The discussion in the Committee Note about brief lengths was revised, and the discussion of subdivision (f) was expanded.
