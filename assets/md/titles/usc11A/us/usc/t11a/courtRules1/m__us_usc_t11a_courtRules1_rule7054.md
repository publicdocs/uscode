### Rule 7054. Judgments; Costs

    (a)  __Judgments__  __.__ 

     Rule 54(a)–(c) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings.

    (b)  __Costs__  __.__ 

     The court may allow costs to the prevailing party except when a statute of the United States or these rules otherwise provides. Costs against the United States, its officers and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on 14 days’ notice; on motion served within seven days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.

(As amended Apr. 23, 2012, eff. Dec. 1, 2012.)

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2012 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) is amended to provide more time for a party to respond to the prevailing party’s bill of costs. The former rule’s provision of one day’s notice was unrealistically short. The change to 14 days conforms to the change made to Civil Rule 54(d). Extension from five to seven days of the time for serving a motion for court review of the clerk’s action implements changes in connection with the December 1, 2009, amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. Throughout the rules, deadlines have been amended in the following manner:

    • 5-day periods became 7-day periods.

    • 10-day periods became 14-day periods.

    • 15-day periods became 14-day periods.

    • 20-day periods became 21-day periods.

    • 25-day periods became 28-day periods.

    Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in subd. (a), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
