### Rule 3002.1. Notice Relating to Claims Secured by Security Interest in the Debtor’s Principal Residence

    (a) __In General. This rule applies in a chapter 13 case to claims that are (1) secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence, and (2) provided for under § 1322(b)(5) of the Code in the debtor’s plan.__ 

    (b) __Notice of Payment Changes. The holder of the claim shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee a notice of any change in the payment amount, including any change that results from an interest rate or escrow account adjustment, no later than 21 days before a payment in the new amount is due.__ 

    (c) __Notice of Fees, Expenses, and Charges. The holder of the claim shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee a notice itemizing all fees, expenses, or charges (1) that were incurred in connection with the claim after the bankruptcy case was filed, and (2) that the holder asserts are recoverable against the debtor or against the debtor’s principal residence. The notice shall be served within 180 days after the date on which the fees, expenses, or charges are incurred.__ 

    (d) __Form and Content. A notice filed and served under subdivision (b) or (c) of this rule shall be prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and filed as a supplement to the holder’s proof of claim. The notice is not subject to Rule 3001(f).__ 

    (e) __Determination of Fees, Expenses, or Charges. On motion of the debtor or trustee filed within one year after service of a notice under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court shall, after notice and hearing, determine whether payment of any claimed fee, expense, or charge is required by the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law to cure a default or maintain payments in accordance with § 1322(b)(5) of the Code.__ 

    (f) __Notice of Final Cure Payment. Within 30 days after the debtor completes all payments under the plan, the trustee shall file and serve on the holder of the claim, the debtor, and debtor’s counsel a notice stating that the debtor has paid in full the amount required to cure any default on the claim. The notice shall also inform the holder of its obligation to file and serve a response under subdivision (g). If the debtor contends that final cure payment has been made and all plan payments have been completed, and the trustee does not timely file and serve the notice required by this subdivision, the debtor may file and serve the notice.__ 

    (g) __Response to Notice of Final Cure Payment. Within 21 days after service of the notice under subdivision (f) of this rule, the holder shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee a statement indicating (1) whether it agrees that the debtor has paid in full the amount required to cure the default on the claim, and (2) whether the debtor is otherwise current on all payments consistent with § 1322(b)(5) of the Code. The statement shall itemize the required cure or postpetition amounts, if any, that the holder contends remain unpaid as of the date of the statement. The statement shall be filed as a supplement to the holder’s proof of claim and is not subject to Rule 3001(f).__ 

    (h) __Determination of Final Cure and Payment. On motion of the debtor or trustee filed within 21 days after service of the statement under subdivision (g) of this rule, the court shall, after notice and hearing, determine whether the debtor has cured the default and paid all required postpetition amounts.__ 

    (i) __Failure to Notify. If the holder of a claim fails to provide any information as required by subdivision (b), (c), or (g) of this rule, the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both of the following actions:__ 

        (1) preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information, in any form, as evidence in any contested matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the court determines that the failure was substantially justified or is harmless; or

        (2) award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees caused by the failure.

(Added Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2011__ 

    This rule is new. It is added to aid in the implementation of § 1322(b)(5), which permits a chapter 13 debtor to cure a default and maintain payments on a home mortgage over the course of the debtor’s plan. It applies regardless of whether the trustee or the debtor is the disbursing agent for postpetition mortgage payments.

    In order to be able to fulfill the obligations of § l322(b)(5), a debtor and the trustee have to be informed of the exact amount needed to cure any prepetition arrearage, see Rule 3001(c)(2), and the amount of the postpetition payment obligations. If the latter amount changes over time, due to the adjustment of the interest rate, escrow account adjustments, or the assessment of fees, expenses, or other charges, notice of any change in payment amount needs to be conveyed to the debtor and trustee. Timely notice of these changes will permit the debtor or trustee to challenge the validity of any such charges, if appropriate, and to adjust postpetition mortgage payments to cover any undisputed claimed adjustment. Compliance with the notice provision of the rule should also eliminate any concern on the part of the holder of the claim that informing a debtor of a change in postpetition payment obligations might violate the automatic stay.

    Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) specifies that this rule applies only in a chapter 13 case to claims secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence.

    Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) requires the holder of a claim to notify the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee of any postpetition change in the mortgage payment amount at least 21 days before the new payment amount is due.

    Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) requires an itemized notice to be given, within 180 days of incurrence, of any postpetition fees, expenses, or charges that the holder of the claim asserts are recoverable from the debtor or against the debtor’s principal residence. This might include, for example, inspection fees, late charges, or attorney’s fees.

    Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) provides the method of giving the notice under subdivisions (b) and (c). In both instances, the holder of the claim must give notice of the change as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. In addition to serving the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee, the holder of the claim must also file the notice on the claims register in the case as a supplement to its proof of claim. Rule 3001(f) does not apply to any notice given under subdivision (b) or (c), and therefore the notice will not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the payment change or of the fee, expense, or charge.

    Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) permits the debtor or trustee, within a year after service of a notice under subdivision (c), to seek a determination by the court as to whether the fees, expenses, or charges set forth in the notice are required by the underlying agreement or applicable nonbankruptcy law to cure a default or maintain payments.

    Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) requires the trustee to issue a notice to the holder of the claim, the debtor, and the debtor’s attorney within 30 days after completion of payments under the plan. The notice must (1) indicate that all amounts required to cure a default on a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence have been paid, and (2) direct the holder to comply with subdivision (g). If the trustee fails to file this notice within the required time, this subdivision also permits the debtor to file and serve the notice on the trustee and the holder of the claim.

    Subdivision (g). Subdivision (g) governs the response of the holder of the claim to the trustee’s or debtor’s notice under subdivision (f). Within 21 days after service of notice of the final cure payment, the holder of the claim must file and serve a statement indicating whether the prepetition default has been fully cured and also whether the debtor is current on all payments in accordance with § 1322(b)(5) of the Code. If the holder of the claim contends that all cure payments have not been made or that the debtor is not current on other payments required by § 1322(b)(5), the response must itemize all amounts, other than regular future installment payments, that the holder contends are due.

    Subdivision (h). Subdivision (h) provides a procedure for the judicial resolution of any disputes that may arise about payment of a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence. Within 21 days after the service of the statement under (g), the trustee or debtor may move for a determination by the court of whether any default has been cured and whether any other non-current obligations remain outstanding.

    Subdivision (i). Subdivision (i) specifies sanctions that may be imposed if the holder of a claim fails to provide any of the information as required by subdivisions (b), (c), or (g).

    If, after the chapter 13 debtor has completed payments under the plan and the case has been closed, the holder of a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence seeks to recover amounts that should have been but were not disclosed under this rule, the debtor may move to have the case reopened in order to seek sanctions against the holder of the claim under subdivision (i).

    Changes Made After Publication.

    Subdivision (a). As part of organizational changes intended to make the rule shorter and clearer, a new subdivision (a) was inserted that specifies the applicability of the rule. Other subdivision designations were changed accordingly.

    Subdivision (b). The timing of the notice of payment change, addressed in subdivision (a) of the published rule, was changed from 30 to 21 days before payment must be made in the new amount.

    Subdivision (d). The provisions of the published rule prescribing the procedure for providing notice of payment changes and of fees, expenses, and charges were moved to subdivision (d).

    Subdivision (e). As part of the organizational revision of the rule, the provision governing the resolution of disputes over claimed fees, expenses, or charges was moved to this subdivision.

    Subdivision (f). The triggering event for the filing of the notice of final cure payment was changed to the debtor’s completion of all payments required under the plan. A sentence was added requiring the notice to inform the holder of the mortgage claim of its obligation to file and serve a response under subdivision (g).

    Subdivision (h). The caption of this subdivision (which was subdivision (f) as published), was changed to describe its content more precisely.

    Subdivision (i). The clause “the holder shall be precluded” was deleted, and the provision was revised to state that “the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both” of the specified actions.

    Committee Note. A sentence was added to the first paragraph to clarify that the rule applies regardless of whether ongoing mortgage payments are made directly by the debtor or disbursed through the chapter 13 trustee. Other changes were made to the Committee Note to reflect the changes made to the rule.

    Other changes. Stylistic changes were made throughout the rule and Committee Note.
