### Rule 6002. Accounting by Prior Custodian of Property of the Estate

    (a)  __Accounting Required__  __.__ 

     Any custodian required by the Code to deliver property in the custodian’s possession or control to the trustee shall promptly file and transmit to the United States trustee a report and account with respect to the property of the estate and the administration thereof.

    (b)  __Examination of Administration__  __.__ 

     On the filing and transmittal of the report and account required by subdivision (a) of this rule and after an examination has been made into the superseded administration, after notice and a hearing, the court shall determine the propriety of the administration, including the reasonableness of all disbursements.

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    “Custodian” is defined in § 101(10) of the Code. The definition includes a trustee or receiver appointed in proceedings not under the Code, as well as an assignee for the benefit of creditors.

    This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed by a custodian who under § 543 of the Code is required to deliver property to the trustee and to account for its disposition. The examination under subdivision (b) may be initiated (1) on the motion of the custodian required to account under subdivision (a) for an approval of his account and discharge thereon, (2) on the motion of, or the filing of an objection to the custodian’s account by, the trustee or any other party in interest, or (3) on the court’s own initiative. Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.

    Section 543(d) is similar to an abstention provision. It grants the bankruptcy court discretion to permit the custodian to remain in possession and control of the property. In that event, the custodian is excused from complying with § 543(a)–(c) and thus would not be required to turn over the property to the trustee. When there is no duty to turn over to the trustee, Rule 6002 would not be applicable.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to review, object to, or to otherwise be heard regarding the custodian’s report and accounting. See §§ 307 and 543 of the Code.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the language of § 102(1) of the Code.
