### Rule 7062. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment

    Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings.

(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 1999, eff. Dec. 1, 1999.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    The additional exceptions set forth in this rule make applicable to those matters the consequences contained in Rule 62(c) and (d) with respect to orders in actions for injunctions.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to include as additional exceptions to Rule 62(a) an order granting relief from the automatic stay of actions against codebtors provided by § 1201 of the Code, the sale or lease of property of the estate under § 363, and the assumption or assignment of an executory contract under § 365.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—1999 Amendment__ 

    The additional exceptions to Rule 62(a) consist of orders that are issued in contested matters. These exceptions are deleted from this rule because of the amendment to Rule 9014 that renders this rule inapplicable in contested matters unless the court orders otherwise. See also the amendments to Rules 3020, 3021, 4001, 6004, and 6006 that delay the implementation of certain types of orders for a period of ten days unless the court otherwise directs.

    GAP Report on Rule 7062. No changes since publication.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in text, are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
