### Rule 2011. Evidence of Debtor in Possession or Qualification of Trustee

    (a) Whenever evidence is required that a debtor is a debtor in possession or that a trustee has qualified, the clerk may so certify and the certificate shall constitute conclusive evidence of that fact.

    (b) If a person elected or appointed as trustee does not qualify within the time prescribed by § 322(a) of the Code, the clerk shall so notify the court and the United States trustee.

(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate issued by the clerk that the debtor is a debtor in possession. See Official Form No. 26. Only chapter 11 of the Code provides for a debtor in possession. See § 1107(a) of the Code. If, however, a trustee is appointed in the chapter 11 case, there will not be a debtor in possession. See §§ 1101(1), 1105 of the Code.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to provide a procedure for proving that a trustee has qualified in accordance with § 322 of the Code. Subdivision (b) is added so that the court and the United States trustee will be informed if the person selected as trustee pursuant to §§ 701, 702, 1104, 1202, 1302, or 1163 fails to qualify within the time prescribed in § 322(a).
