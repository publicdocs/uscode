### Rule 8012. Corporate Disclosure Statement

    (a)  __Who Must File__  __.__ 

     Any nongovernmental corporate party appearing in the district court or BAP must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation.

    (b)  __Time to File; Supplemental Filing__  __.__ 

     A party must file the statement with its principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing. Even if the statement has already been filed, the party’s principal brief must include a statement before the table of contents. A party must supplement its statement whenever the required information changes.

(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)

 __Prior Rule__ 

    A prior Rule 8012, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, related to oral argument, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2014__ 

    This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 26.1. It requires the filing of corporate disclosure statements and supplemental statements in order to assist district court and BAP judges in determining whether they should recuse themselves. Rule 9001 makes the definitions in § 101 of the Code applicable to these rules. Under § 101(9) the word “corporation” includes a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, business trust, and certain other entities that are not designated under applicable law as corporations. 

    If filed separately from a brief, motion, response, petition, or answer, the statement must be filed and served in accordance with Rule 8011. Under Rule 8015(a)(7)(B)(iii), the corporate disclosure statement is not included in calculating applicable word-count limitations. 

    Changes Made After Publication and Comment. A sentence was added to the Committee Note to draw attention to the broad definition of “corporation” under § 101(9) of the Bankruptcy Code.
