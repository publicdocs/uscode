### Rule 4002. Duties of Debtor

    (a) __In General. In addition to performing other duties prescribed by the Code and rules, the debtor shall:__ 

        (1) attend and submit to an examination at the times ordered by the court;

        (2) attend the hearing on a complaint objecting to discharge and testify, if called as a witness;

        (3) inform the trustee immediately in writing as to the location of real property in which the debtor has an interest and the name and address of every person holding money or property subject to the debtor’s withdrawal or order if a schedule of property has not yet been filed pursuant to Rule 1007;

        (4) cooperate with the trustee in the preparation of an inventory, the examination of proofs of claim, and the administration of the estate; and

        (5) file a statement of any change of the debtor’s address.

    (b) __Individual Debtor’s Duty To Provide Documentation.__ 

        (1)

 Personal Identification. Every individual debtor shall bring to the meeting of creditors under § 341:

            (A) a picture identification issued by a governmental unit, or other personal identifying information that establishes the debtor’s identity; and

            (B) evidence of social-security number(s), or a written statement that such documentation does not exist.

        (2)

 Financial Information. Every individual debtor shall bring to the meeting of creditors under § 341, and make available to the trustee, the following documents or copies of them, or provide a written statement that the documentation does not exist or is not in the debtor’s possession:

            (A) evidence of current income such as the most recent payment advice;

            (B) unless the trustee or the United States trustee instructs otherwise, statements for each of the debtor’s depository and investment accounts, including checking, savings, and money market accounts, mutual funds and brokerage accounts for the time period that includes the date of the filing of the petition; and

            (C) documentation of monthly expenses claimed by the debtor if required by § 707(b)(2)(A) or (B).

        (3) Tax Return. At least 7 days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341, the debtor shall provide to the trustee a copy of the debtor’s federal income tax return for the most recent tax year ending immediately before the commencement of the case and for which a return was filed, including any attachments, or a transcript of the tax return, or provide a written statement that the documentation does not exist.

        (4) Tax Returns Provided to Creditors. If a creditor, at least 14 days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341, requests a copy of the debtor’s tax return that is to be provided to the trustee under subdivision (b)(3), the debtor, at least 7 days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341, shall provide to the requesting creditor a copy of the return, including any attachments, or a transcript of the tax return, or provide a written statement that the documentation does not exist.

        (5) Confidentiality of Tax Information. The debtor’s obligation to provide tax returns under Rule 4002(b)(3) and (b)(4) is subject to procedures for safeguarding the confidentiality of tax information established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983__ 

    This rule should be read together with §§ 343 and 521 of the Code and Rule 1007, all of which impose duties on the debtor. Clause (3) of this rule implements the provisions of Rule 2015(a).

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    New clause (5) of the rule imposes on the debtor the duty to advise the clerk of any change of the debtor’s address.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2008 Amendment__ 

    This rule is amended to implement § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv) and (e)(2), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. These Code amendments expressly require the debtor to file with the court, or provide to the trustee, specific documents. The amendments to the rule implement these obligations and establish a time frame for creditors to make requests for a copy of the debtor’s Federal income tax return. The rule also requires the debtor to provide documentation in support of claimed expenses under § 707(b)(2)(A) and (B).

    Subdivision (b) of the rule is also amended to require the debtor to cooperate with the trustee by providing materials and documents necessary to assist the trustee in the performance of the trustee’s duties. Nothing in the rule, however, is intended to limit or restrict the debtor’s duties under § 521, or to limit the access of the Attorney General to any information provided by the debtor in the case. Subdivision (b)(2) does not require that the debtor create documents or obtain documents from third parties; rather, the debtor’s obligation is to bring to the meeting of creditors under § 341 the documents which the debtor possesses. Under subdivision (b)(2)(B), the trustee or the United States trustee can instruct debtors that they need not provide the documents described in that subdivision. Under subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4), the debtor must obtain and provide copies of tax returns or tax transcripts to the appropriate person, unless no such documents exist. Any written statement that the debtor provides indicating either that documents do not exist or are not in the debtor’s possession must be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as required under Rule 1008.

    Because the amendment implements the debtor’s duty to cooperate with the trustee, the materials provided to the trustee would not be made available to any other party in interest at the § 341 meeting of creditors other than the Attorney General. Some of the documents may contain otherwise private information that should not be disseminated. For example, pay stubs and financial account statements might include the social-security numbers of the debtor and the debtor’s spouse and dependents, as well as the names of the debtor’s children. The debtor should redact all but the last four digits of all social-security numbers and the names of any minors when they appear in these documents. This type of information would not usually be needed by creditors and others who may be attending the meeting. If a creditor perceives a need to review specific documents or other evidence, the creditor may proceed under Rule 2004.

    Tax information produced under this rule is subject to procedures for safeguarding confidentiality established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

    Changes Made After Publication. The second paragraph of the Committee Note was amended to clarify that the debtor’s duty to provide copies of tax returns or tax transcripts are governed by a different standard than the debtor’s duty to provide other financial information.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment__ 

    The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:

    • 5-day periods become 7-day periods

    • 10-day periods become 14-day periods

    • 15-day periods become 14-day periods

    • 20-day periods become 21-day periods

    • 25-day periods become 28-day periods
