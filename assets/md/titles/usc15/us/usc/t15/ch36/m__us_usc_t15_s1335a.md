If a subcommittee or committee of the Congress requests the Secretary to provide it such a list, the Secretary shall make the list available to the subcommittee or committee and shall, at the same time, notify in writing the person who provided the list of such request.

            (C)

             The Secretary shall establish written procedures to assure the confidentiality of information provided under subsection (a). Such procedures shall include the designation of a duly authorized agent to serve as custodian of such information. The agent—

                (i) shall take physical possession of the information and, when not in use by a person authorized to have access to such information, shall store it in a locked cabinet or file, and

                (ii) shall maintain a complete record of any person who inspects or uses the information.

                Such procedures shall require that any person permitted access to the information shall be instructed in writing not to disclose the information to anyone who is not entitled to have access to the information.
