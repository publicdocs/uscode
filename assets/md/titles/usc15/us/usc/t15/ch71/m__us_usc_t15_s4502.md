         Subject to paragraph (2)—

            (A) all rulings, policies, or other statements (including any administrative order or settlement agreement) issued after October 21, 1986, by any office, official, or employee of the Department of Energy; and

            shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

        (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the settlement approved on July 7, 1986, in In Re: the Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, M.D.L. No. 378, in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.

    (b) __to (d) Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 99–509, title III__  __][/us/pl/99/509/tIII]__  __, § 3003(e), as added__  __[__  __Pub. L. 105–277, div. A__  __][/us/pl/105/277/dA]__  __, § 101(e) \[title III, § 337\],__  __Oct. 21, 1998__  __,__  __[__  __112 Stat. 2681–231__  __][/us/stat/112/2681-231]__  __, 2681–295__ 

    (e) __Repeal of subsections (b) to (d); equitable distribution of escrow remainder to claimants__ 

        Subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section are repealed, and any rights that may have arisen are extinguished, on the date of the enactment of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999.

The Secretary shall assure that the amount remaining in escrow to satisfy refined petroleum product claims for direct restitution is allocated equitably among the claimants.
