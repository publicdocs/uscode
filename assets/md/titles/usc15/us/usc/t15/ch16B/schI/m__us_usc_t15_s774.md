The report shall also contain the Administration’s recommendations for improving the utilization and effectiveness of Federal energy data and its manner of collection. The data collection and analysis portion of this report shall be prepared by the Federal Trade Commission for the Administration.

        (2) an analysis of the impact these actions have had on the Nation’s civilian requirements for energy supplies for materials and commodities;

        (3)

         a projection of the energy supply for the midterm and long term for each of the major types of fuel and the potential size and impact of any anticipated shortages, including recommendations for measures to—

            (A) minimize deficiencies of energy supplies in relation to needs;
