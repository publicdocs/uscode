## § 761. Congressional declaration of purpose

    (a) __Objectives__ 

        The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and the common defense and security require positive and effective action to conserve scarce energy supplies, to insure fair and efficient distribution of, and the maintenance of fair and reasonable consumer prices for, such supplies, to promote the expansion of readily usable energy sources, and to assist in developing policies and plans to meet the energy needs of the Nation.

    (b) __Necessity for reorganization__ 

        The Congress finds that to help achieve these objectives, and to assure a coordinated and effective approach to overcoming energy shortages, it is necessary to reorganize certain agencies and functions of the executive branch and to establish a Federal Energy Administration.

    (c) __Creation of Federal Energy Administration__ 

        The sole purpose of this chapter is to create an administration in the executive branch, called the Federal Energy Administration, to vest in the Administration certain functions as provided in this chapter, and to transfer to such Administration certain executive branch functions authorized by other laws, where such transfer is necessary on an interim basis to deal with the Nation’s energy shortages.
