        Any person adversely affected by any pattern or practice of telemarketing which violates any rule of the Commission under [section 6102 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6102], or an authorized person acting on such person’s behalf, may, within 3 years after discovery of the violation, bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States against a person who has engaged or is engaging in such pattern or practice of telemarketing if the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000 in actual damages for each person adversely affected by such telemarketing. Such an action may be brought to enjoin such telemarketing, to enforce compliance with any rule of the Commission under [section 6102 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6102], to obtain damages, or to obtain such further and other relief as the court may deem appropriate.

    (b) __Notice__ 

        The plaintiff shall serve prior written notice of the action upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, except in any case where such prior notice is not feasible, in which case the person shall serve such notice immediately upon instituting such action. The Commission shall have the right (A) to intervene in the action, (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising therein, and (C) to file petitions for appeal.

    (d) __Cost and fees__ 

        The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought under subsection (a), may award costs of suit and reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses to the prevailing party.

    (e) __Construction__ 

        Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person may have under any statute or common law.

    (f) __Venue; service of process__ 

        Any civil action brought under subsection (a) in a district court of the United States may be brought in the district in which the defendant is found, is an inhabitant, or transacts business or wherever venue is proper under [section 1391 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1391].
