## § 4306. Application of section 4303 protections to production of products, processes, and services

    Notwithstanding sections 4303 and 4305 of this title, the protections of [section 4303 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s4303] shall not apply with respect to a joint venture’s production of a product, process, or service, as referred to in [section 4301(a)(6)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s4301/a/6/D], unless—

    (1) the principal facilities for such production are located in the United States or its territories, and

    (2) each person who controls any party to such venture (including such party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country’s domestic persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production.
