        (3) prohibit a purchasing group or its members from purchasing insurance on the group basis described in paragraph (2) of this subsection;

        (4) prohibit a purchasing group from obtaining insurance on a group basis because the group has not been in existence for a minimum period of time or because any member has not belonged to the group for a minimum period of time;

        (5) require that a purchasing group must have a minimum number of members, common ownership or affiliation, or a certain legal form;

        (6) require that a certain percentage of a purchasing group must obtain insurance on a group basis;

    (c) __Licensing of agents or brokers for purchasing groups__ 

        A State may require that a person acting, or offering to act, as an agent or broker for a purchasing group obtain a license from that State, except that a State may not impose any qualification or requirement which discriminates against a nonresident agent or broker.

    (d) __Notice to State insurance commissioners of intent to do business__ 

        (1)

         A purchasing group which intends to do business in any State shall furnish notice of such intention to the insurance commissioner of such State. Such notice—

            (A) shall identify the State in which such group is domiciled;

            (B) shall specify the lines and classifications of liability insurance which the purchasing group intends to purchase;

    (e) __Designation of agent for service of documents and process__ 

    A purchasing group shall register with and designate the State insurance commissioner of each State in which it does business as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving service of legal documents or process, except that such requirement shall not apply in the case of a purchasing group—

        (1)

         which—

            (A) was domiciled before April 1, 1986; and

            (B) is domiciled on and after October 27, 1986;  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See Codification note below. </sup></sup> 

            in any State of the United States;

        (3) which was a purchasing group under the requirements of this chapter before October 27, 1986; and

        (4) as long as such group does not purchase insurance that was not authorized for purposes of an exemption under this chapter as in effect before October 27, 1986.

    (f) __Purchases of insurance through licensed agents or brokers acting pursuant to surplus lines laws__

    (g) __State powers to enforce State laws__

        Nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any State to bring an action in any Federal or State court.
