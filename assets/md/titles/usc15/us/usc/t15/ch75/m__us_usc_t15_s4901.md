([Pub. L. 100–418, title V, § 5401][/us/pl/100/418/s5401], Aug. 23, 1988, [102 Stat. 1463][/us/stat/102/1463].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this subtitle”, meaning subtitle E (§§ 5401 to 5413, 5421 to 5423) of title V of [Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418] which, in addition to enacting this chapter, enacted [section 4603a of this title][/us/usc/t15/s4603a] and [section 194b of Title 2][/us/usc/t2/s194b], The Congress. For complete classification of subtitle E to the Code, see Tables.

    [Section 4906 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s4906], referred to in par. (4), was in the original “section 3816”, meaning [section 3816 of Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418/s3816], and was translated as if it read [section 5406 of Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418/s5406], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 3816 was the provision which established the Data Bank in a predecessor version of H.R. 4848 (which became [Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418]), [Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418] does not contain a section 3816, and [section 5406 of Pub. L. 100–418][/us/pl/100/418/s5406] is the provision establishing the Data Bank.
