    The President should direct the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Committee, to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward international protocols and other agreements to coordinate global change research activities. Such discussions should include the following issues:

        (1) Allocation of costs in global change research programs, especially with respect to major capital projects.

        (2) Coordination of global change research plans with those developed by international organizations such as the International Council on Scientific Unions, the World Meteorological Organization, and the United Nations Environment Program.

        (3) Establishment of global change research centers and training programs for scientists, especially those from developing nations.

        (4)

         Development of innovative methods for management of international global change research, including—

            (A) use of new or existing intergovernmental organizations for the coordination or funding of global change research; and

            (B) creation of a limited foundation for global change research.

        (5)

         The prompt establishment of international projects to—

            (A) create globally accessible formats for data collected by various international sources; and

            (B) combine and interpret data from various sources to produce information readily usable by policymakers attempting to formulate effective strategies for preventing, mitigating, and adapting to possible adverse effects of global change.

        (6) Establishment of international offices to disseminate information useful in identifying, preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the possible effects of global change.

Such discussions should include, but not be limited to, the following issues:

        (1) Creation of an international cooperative program to fund research related to energy efficiency, solar and other renewable energy sources, and passively safe and diversion-resistant nuclear reactors.

        (2) Creation of an international cooperative program to develop low cost energy technologies which are appropriate to the environmental, economic, and social needs of developing nations.

        (3) Exchange of information concerning environmentally safe energy technologies and practices, including those described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
