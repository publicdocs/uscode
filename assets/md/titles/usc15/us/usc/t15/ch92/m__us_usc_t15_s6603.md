## § 6603. Application of chapter

    (a) __General rule__ 

        This chapter applies to any Y2K action brought after January 1, 1999, for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, or for a potential Y2K failure that could occur or has allegedly caused harm or injury before January 1, 2003, including any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an action.

    (b) __No new cause of action created__ 

        Nothing in this chapter creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise explicitly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter expands any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense otherwise available under Federal or State law.

    (c) __Claims for personal injury or wrongful death excluded__ 

        This chapter does not apply to a claim for personal injury or for wrongful death.

    (d) __Warranty and contract preservation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K action any written contractual term, including a limitation or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, 1999, specifically addressing that term.

        (2) __Interpretation of contract__ 

            In any Y2K action in which a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at the time the contract was executed.

        (3) __Unconscionability__ 

            Nothing in paragraph (1) shall prevent enforcement of State law doctrines of unconscionability, including adhesion, recognized as of January 1, 1999, in controlling judicial precedent by the courts of the State whose law applies to the Y2K action.

    (e) __Preemption of State law__ 

        This chapter supersedes State law to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing in this chapter implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of sovereign immunity.

    (f) __Application with Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act__ 

        Nothing in this chapter supersedes any provision of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

    (g) __Application to actions brought by a government entity__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            To the extent provided in this subsection, this chapter shall apply to an action brought by a government entity described in [section 6602(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6602/1/C].

        (2) __Definitions__

        (1) __In general__ 

            No person who transacts business on matters directly or indirectly affecting residential mortgages shall cause or permit a foreclosure on any such mortgage against a consumer as a result of an actual Y2K failure that results in an inability to accurately or timely process any mortgage payment transaction.

        (2) __Notice__ 

            A consumer who is affected by an inability described in paragraph (1) shall notify the servicer for the mortgage, in writing and within 7 business days from the time that the consumer becomes aware of the Y2K failure and the consumer’s inability to accurately or timely fulfill his or her obligation to pay, of such failure and inability and shall provide to the servicer any available documentation with respect to the failure.

        (3) __Actions may resume after grace period__

            (A) four weeks after January 1, 2000; or
