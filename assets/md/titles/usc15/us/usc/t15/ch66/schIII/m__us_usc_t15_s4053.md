## § 4053. Barter arrangements

    (a) __Report on status of Federal barter programs__ 

        The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy shall, not later than 90 days after July 12, 1985, submit to the Congress a report on the status of Federal programs relating to the barter or exchange of commodities owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation for materials and products produced in foreign countries. Such report shall include details of any changes necessary in existing law to allow the Department of Agriculture and, in the case of petroleum resources, the Department of Energy, to implement fully any barter program.

    (b) __Authorities of President__ 

    The President is authorized—

        (1) to barter stocks of agricultural commodities acquired by the Government for petroleum and petroleum products, and for other materials vital to the national interest, which are produced abroad, in situations in which sales would otherwise not occur; and

        (2) to purchase petroleum and petroleum products, and other materials vital to the national interest, which are produced abroad and acquired by persons in the United States through barter for agricultural commodities produced in and exported from the United States through normal commercial trade channels.

    (c) __Other provisions of law not affected__ 

        In the case of any petroleum, petroleum products, or other materials vital to the national interest, which are acquired under subsection (b), nothing in this section shall be construed to render inapplicable the provisions of any law then in effect which apply to the storage, distribution, or use of such petroleum, petroleum products, or other materials vital to the national interest.

    (d) __Conventional markets not to be displaced by barters__ 

        The President shall take steps to ensure that, in making any barter described in subsection (a) or (b)(1) or any purchase authorized by subsection (b)(2), existing export markets for agricultural commodities operating on conventional business terms are safeguarded from displacement by the barter described in subsection (a), (b)(1), or (b)(2), as the case may be. In addition, the President shall ensure that any such barter is consistent with the international obligations of the United States, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

    (e) __Report to Congress__ 

        The Secretary of Energy shall report to the Congress on the effect on energy security and on domestic energy supplies of any action taken under this section which results in the acquisition by the Government of petroleum or petroleum products. Such report shall be submitted to the Congress not later than 90 days after such acquisition.
