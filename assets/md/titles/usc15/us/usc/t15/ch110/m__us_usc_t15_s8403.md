    (1) provides text that clearly and conspicuously discloses all material terms of the transaction before obtaining the consumer’s billing information;

    (2) obtains a consumer’s express informed consent before charging the consumer’s credit card, debit card, bank account, or other financial account for products or services through such transaction; and
