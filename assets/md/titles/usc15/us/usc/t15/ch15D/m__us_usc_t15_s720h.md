## § 720h. Clarification of ANGTA status and authorities

    (a) __Savings clause__ 

    Nothing in this chapter affects—

        (1) any decision, certificate, permit, right-of-way, lease, or other authorization issued under section 9 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 ([15 U.S.C. 719g][/us/usc/t15/s719g]); or

        (2) any Presidential finding or waiver issued in accordance with that Act \[[15 U.S.C. 719][/us/usc/t15/s719] et seq.\].

    (b) __Clarification of authority to amend terms and conditions to meet current project requirements__ 

    Any Federal agency responsible for granting or issuing any certificate, permit, right-of-way, lease, or other authorization under section 9 of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 ([15 U.S.C. 719g][/us/usc/t15/s719g]) may add to, amend, or rescind any term or condition included in the certificate, permit, right-of-way, lease, or other authorization to meet current project requirements (including the physical design, facilities, and tariff specifications), if the addition, amendment, or rescission—

        (1) would not compel any change in the basic nature and general route of the Alaska natural gas transportation system as designated and described in section 2 of the President’s decision; or

        (2) would not otherwise prevent or impair in any significant respect the expeditious construction and initial operation of the Alaska natural gas transportation system.

    (c) __Updated environmental reviews__ 

        The Secretary shall require the sponsor of the Alaska natural gas transportation system to submit such updated environmental data, reports, permits, and impact analyses as the Secretary determines are necessary to develop detailed terms, conditions, and compliance plans required by section 5 of the President’s decision.
