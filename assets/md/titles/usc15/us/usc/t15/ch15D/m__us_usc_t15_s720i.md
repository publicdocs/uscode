## § 720i. Sense of Congress concerning use of steel manufactured in North America and negotiation of a project labor agreement

It is the sense of Congress that—

    (1) an Alaska natural gas transportation project would provide significant economic benefits to the United States and Canada; and

    (2)

     to maximize those benefits, the sponsors of the Alaska natural gas transportation project should make every effort to—

        (A) use steel that is manufactured in North America; and

        (B) negotiate a project labor agreement to expedite construction of the pipeline.
