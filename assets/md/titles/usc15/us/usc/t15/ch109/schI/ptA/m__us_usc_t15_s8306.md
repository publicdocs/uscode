## § 8306. Determining status of novel derivative products

    (a) __Process for determining the status of a novel derivative product__ 

        (1) __Notice__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any person filing a proposal to list or trade a novel derivative product that may have elements of both securities and contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or options on such contracts or options on commodities) may concurrently provide notice and furnish a copy of such filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Any such notice shall state that notice has been made with both Commissions.

            (B) __Notification__ 

                If no concurrent notice is made pursuant to subparagraph (A), within 5 business days after determining that a proposal that seeks to list or trade a novel derivative product may have elements of both securities and contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or options on such contracts or options on commodities), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as applicable, shall notify the other Commission and provide a copy of such filing to the other Commission.

        (2) __Request for determination__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                No later than 21 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), or upon its own initiative if no such notice is received, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may request that the Securities and Exchange Commission issue a determination as to whether a product is a security, as defined in [section 78c(a)(10) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/10].

            (B) __Request__ 

                No later than 21 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), or upon its own initiative if no such notice is received, the Securities and Exchange Commission may request that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issue a determination as to whether a product is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery, an option on such a contract, or an option on a commodity subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction under [section 2(a)(1)(A) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s2/a/1/A].

            (C) __Requirement relating to request__ 

                A request under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be made by submitting such request, in writing, to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as applicable.

            (D) __Effect__ 

            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent—

                (i) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from requesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission grant an exemption pursuant to [section 78mm(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78mm/a/1] with respect to a product that is the subject of a filing under paragraph (1); or

                (ii) the Securities and Exchange Commission from requesting that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission grant an exemption pursuant to [section 6(c)(1) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s6/c/1] with respect to a product that is the subject of a filing under paragraph (1),

                Provided, however, that nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue an exemption requested pursuant to this subparagraph; provided further, That an order granting or denying an exemption described in this subparagraph and issued under paragraph (3)(B) shall not be subject to judicial review pursuant to subsection (b).

            (E) __Withdrawal of request__ 

                A request under subparagraph (A) or (B) may be withdrawn by the Commission making the request at any time prior to a determination being made pursuant to paragraph (3) for any reason by providing written notice to the head of the other Commission.

        (3) __Determination__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no later than 120 days after the date of receipt of a request—

            (A) under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2), unless such request has been withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (2)(E), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as applicable, shall, by order, issue the determination requested in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2), as applicable, and the reasons therefor; or

            (B) under paragraph (2)(D), unless such request has been withdrawn, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as applicable, shall grant an exemption or provide reasons for not granting such exemption, provided that any decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission not to grant such exemption shall not be reviewable under [section 78y of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78y].

    (b) __Judicial resolution__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission may petition the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of a final order of the other Commission issued pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(A), with respect to a novel derivative product that may have elements of both securities and contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or options on such contracts or options on commodities) that it believes affects its statutory jurisdiction within 60 days after the date of entry of such order, a written petition requesting a review of the order. Any such proceeding shall be expedited by the Court of Appeals.

        (2) __Transmittal of petition and record__

        (3) __Standard of review__ 

            The court, in considering a petition filed pursuant to paragraph (1), shall give no deference to, or presumption in favor of, the views of either Commission.

        (4) __Judicial stay__ 

            The filing of a petition by the complaining Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) shall operate as a stay of the order, until the date on which the determination of the court is final (including any appeal of the determination).
