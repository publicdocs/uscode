        (1) complement basic superconductivity research by promoting the rapid development of manufacturing and processing technologies necessary for the commercialization of high-temperature superconductors; and

        (2) promote collaborative arrangements and consortia of industry (which shall include small business) in order to lower the barriers to deployment of advanced high-temperature superconductor technology; such consortia to also include, as appropriate, universities and independent research organizations.

    (b) __Impediments to commercialization__ 

        The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in collaboration with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, shall identify those Federal policies and regulations which impede the ability of the private sector to undertake long-term investment programs to commercialize superconductivity applications.
