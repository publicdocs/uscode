## § 644. Awards or contracts

    (a) __Determination__ 

        To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation’s full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, or the solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as determined by the Administration, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity’s Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation’s issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects, or (5) why the agency has determined that the bundled contract (as defined in section 632(o) of this title) is necessary and justified. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the definition of a “United States industry” under the North American Industry Classification System, as established by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.

    (b) __Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency__ 

        With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under [section 694b of this title][/us/usc/t15/s694b], the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.

    (c) __Programs for blind and handicapped individuals__ 

        (1)

         As used in this subsection:

            (A) The term “Committee” means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under [section 8502 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s8502].

            (B) The term “public or private organization for the handicapped” has the same meaning given such term in [section 632(e) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s632/e].

            (C) The term “handicapped individual” has the same meaning given such term in [section 632(f) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s632/f].

        (2)

            (A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.

            (B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to [section 8503 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s8503].

        (3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.

        (4)

            (A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.

            (B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.

        (5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.

        (6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.

        (7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.

    (d) __Priority__ 

        For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.

    (e) __Procurement strategies; contract bundling__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department or agency shall—

            (A) provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and

            (B) invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director access to acquisition plans.

        (2) __Market research__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.

            (B) __Factors__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:

                (i) Cost savings.

                (ii) Quality improvements.

                (iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.

                (iv) Better terms and conditions.

                (v) Any other benefits.

            (C) __Reduction of costs not determinative__ 

                The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.

        (3) __Strategy specifications__ 

        If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:

            (A) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements and a determination that such benefits justify the bundling.

            (B) An identification of any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of contract requirements.

            (C)

             An assessment of—

                (i) the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements; and

                (ii) the specific actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements.

        (4) __Contract teaming__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled or consolidated contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small business concern that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors or a joint venture of small business concerns may submit an offer for the performance of the contract.

            (B) __Evaluation of offers__ 

            The head of the agency shall evaluate an offer described in subparagraph (A) in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors or members of the joint venture as follows:

                (i) __Teams__ 

                    When evaluating an offer of a small business prime contractor that includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities and past performance of the small business prime contractor.

                (ii) __Joint ventures__ 

                    When evaluating an offer of a joint venture of small business concerns, if the joint venture does not demonstrate sufficient capabilities or past performance to be considered for award of a contract opportunity, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each member of the joint venture as the capabilities and past performance of the joint venture.

            (C) __Status as a small business concern__ 

                Participation of a small business concern in a team or a joint venture under this paragraph shall not affect the status of that concern as a small business concern for any other purpose.

    (f) __Contracting preference for small business concerns in a major disaster area__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            In this subsection, the term “disaster area” means the area for which the President has declared a major disaster, during the period of the declaration.

        (2) __Contracting preference__ 

            An agency shall provide a contracting preference for a small business concern located in a disaster area if the small business concern will perform the work required under the contract in the disaster area.

        (3) __Credit for meeting contracting goals__ 

            If an agency awards a contract to a small business concern under the circumstances described in paragraph (2), the value of the contract shall be doubled for purposes of determining compliance with the goals for procurement contracts under subsection (g)(1)(A).

    (g) __Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts__ 

        (1) __Governmentwide goals.—__ 

            (A)  __Establishment__  __.—__ 

            The President shall annually establish Governmentwide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in accordance with the following:

                (i) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. In meeting this goal, the Government shall ensure the participation of small business concerns from a wide variety of industries and from a broad spectrum of small business concerns within each industry.

                (ii) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.

                (iii) The Governmentwide goal for participation by qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall be established at not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.

                (iv) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.

            (B)  __Achievement of governmentwide goals__  __.—__ 

            Each agency shall have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency. The Small Business Administration and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Governmentwide prime contract goal established by the President pursuant to this paragraph.

        (2)

            (A) The head of each Federal agency shall, after consultation with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement contracts of such agency. Such goals shall separately address prime contract awards and subcontract awards for each category of small business covered.

            (B) Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts.

            (C) Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy for final determination.

            (D) After establishing goals under this paragraph for a fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall develop a plan for achieving such goals at both the prime contract and the subcontract level, which shall apportion responsibilities among the agency’s acquisition executives and officials. In establishing goals under this paragraph, the head of each Federal agency shall make a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts and subcontracts of such agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.

            (E)

             The head of each Federal agency, in attempting to attain expanded participation under subparagraph (D), shall consider—

                (i) contracts awarded as the result of unrestricted competition; and

                (ii) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eligible small business concerns under this section and under the program established under [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

            (F)

Probably should be “business”. </sup></sup>  concerns owned and controlled by service disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women, shall be considered toward the annually established agency and Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded.

    (h) __Reporting on goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns__ 

        (1) __Agency reports__ 

        At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall submit to the Administrator a report describing—

            (A) the extent of the participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (including service-disabled veterans), qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in the procurement contracts of such agency during such fiscal year;

            (B) whether the agency achieved the goals established for the agency under subsection (g)(2) with respect to such fiscal year;

            (C) any justifications for a failure to achieve such goals; and

            (D) a remediation plan with proposed new practices to better meet such goals, including analysis of factors leading to any failure to achieve such goals.

        (2) __Reports by Administrator__ 

        Not later than 60 days after receiving a report from each Federal agency under paragraph (1) with respect to a fiscal year, the Administrator shall submit to the President and Congress, and to make available on a public Web site, a report that includes—

            (A) a copy of each report submitted to the Administrator under paragraph (1);

            (B) a determination of whether each goal established by the President under subsection (g)(1) for such fiscal year was achieved;

    (k) __Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization; Director__

Such officer or employee—

        (1) shall be known as the “Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization” for such agency;

        (2) shall be appointed by the head of such agency to a position that is a Senior Executive Service position (as such term is defined under [section 3132(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3132/a]), except that, for any agency in which the positions of Chief Acquisition Officer and senior procurement executive (as such terms are defined under [section 657q(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s657q/a]) are not Senior Executive Service positions, the Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization may be appointed to a position compensated at not less than the minimum rate of basic pay payable for grade GS–15 of the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332] (including comparability payments under [section 5304 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5304]);

Further, the executive branch shall implement this policy by establishing a participation goal for WOSBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total value of all subcontract awards for each fiscal year.

    Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Federal Departments and Agencies. Each department and agency (hereafter referred to collectively as “agency”) that has procurement authority shall develop a long-term comprehensive strategy to expand opportunities for WOSBs. Where feasible and consistent with the effective and efficient performance of its mission, each agency shall establish a goal of achieving a participation rate for WOSBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total value of all subcontract awards for each fiscal year.

    (h) developing an interactive electronic commerce database that allows small businesses to register their businesses and capabilities as potential contractors for Federal agencies, and enables contracting officers to identify and locate potential contractors; and

    (i) working with existing women-owned business organizations, State and local governments, and others in order to promote the sharing of information and the development of more uniform State and local standards for WOSBs that reduce the burden on these firms in competing for procurement opportunities.

    Sec. 4. Other Responsibilities of Federal Agencies. To the extent permitted by law, each Federal agency shall work with the SBA to ensure maximum participation of WOSBs in the procurement process by taking the following steps:

    (a) designating a senior acquisition official who will work with the SBA to identify and promote contracting opportunities for WOSBs;

    (b) requiring contracting officers, to the maximum extent practicable, to include WOSBs in competitive acquisitions;

    (c) prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure acquisitions to facilitate competition by and among small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, SDBs, and WOSBs, and providing guidance on structuring acquisitions, including, but not limited to, those expected to result in multiple award contracts, in order to facilitate competition by and among these groups;

    (d) implementing mentor-protege programs, which include women-owned small business firms; and

    (e) offering industry-wide as well as industry-specific outreach, training, and technical assistance programs for WOSBs including, where appropriate, the use of Government acquisitions forecasts, in order to assist WOSBs in developing their products, skills, business planning practices, and marketing techniques.

    Sec. 6. Action Plans. If a Federal agency fails to meet its annual goals in expanding contract opportunities for WOSBs, it shall work with the SBA to develop an action plan to increase the likelihood that participation goals will be met or exceeded in future years.

    Sec. 7. Compliance. Independent agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this order.

    Sec. 8. Consultation and Advice. In developing the long-term comprehensive strategies required by section 2 of this order, Federal agencies shall consult with, and seek information and advice from, State and local governments, WOSBs, other private-sector partners, and other experts.

    Sec. 9. Judicial Review. This order is for internal management purposes for the Federal Government.

 __Ex. Ord. No. 13170. Increasing Opportunities and Access for Disadvantaged Businesses__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 13170, Oct. 6, 2000, 65 F.R. 60827, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 631][/us/usc/t15/s631] et seq.), section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ([Public Law 103–355][/us/pl/103/355], [15 U.S.C. 644][/us/usc/t15/s644] note), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (\[former\] [41 U.S.C. 403][/us/usc/t41/s403] et seq.), Executive Order 11625 \[[15 U.S.C. 631][/us/usc/t15/s631] note\], and to provide for increased access for disadvantaged businesses to Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure nondiscrimination in Federal procurement opportunities for businesses in the Small Disadvantaged Business Program (SDBs), businesses in the section 8(a) Business Development program of the Small Business Administration (8(a)s), and Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) as defined in section 6 of Executive Order 11625, of October 13, 1971, and to take affirmative action to ensure inclusion of these businesses in Federal contracting. These businesses are of vital importance to job growth and the economic strength of the United States but have faced historic exclusion and underutilization in Federal procurement. All agencies within the executive branch with procurement authority are required to take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to increase contracting between the Federal Government and SDBs, 8(a)s, and MBEs.

    Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies with Procurement Authority. The head of each executive department and agency shall carry out the terms of this order and shall designate, where appropriate, his or her Deputy Secretary or equivalent to implement the terms of this order.

    (a) Each department and agency with procurement authority shall:

    (i) aggressively seek to ensure that 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs are aware of future prime contracting opportunities through wide dissemination of contract announcements, including sources likely to reach 8(a)s, SDBs, other small businesses, and MBEs. Each department and agency shall use all available forms of communication to implement this provision, including the Internet, speciality press, and trade press;

    (ii) work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that information regarding sole source contracts awarded through the section 8(a) program receives the widest dissemination possible to 8(a)s;

    (iii) ensure that the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 \[[Pub. L. 103–355][/us/pl/103/355], see Tables for classification\] are used to the maximum extent permitted by law in areas of economic activity in which SDBs have historically been underused;

    (iv) aggressively use the firms in the section 8(a) program, particularly in the developmental stage of the program, so that these firms have an opportunity to overcome artificial barriers to Federal contracting and gain access to the Federal procurement arena;

    (v) ensure that department and agency heads take all reasonable steps so that prime contractors meet or exceed Federal subcontracting goals, and enforce subcontracting commitments as required by the Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 637(d)][/us/usc/t15/s637/d]) and other related laws. In particular, they shall ensure that prime contractors actively solicit bids for subcontracting opportunities from 8(a)s and SDBs, and fulfill their SDB and section 8(d) subcontracting obligations. Enforcement of SDB subcontracting plan commitments shall include assessments of liquidated damages, where appropriate, pursuant to applicable contract clauses;

    (vi) encourage the establishment of business-to-business mentoring and teaming relationships, including the implementation of Mentor-Protege programs, to foster the development of the technical and managerial capabilities of 8(a)s and SDBs and to facilitate long-term business relationships;

    (vii) offer information, training, and technical assistance programs for 8(a)s and SDBs including, where appropriate, Government acquisition forecasts in order to assist 8(a)s and SDBs in developing their products, skills, business planning practices, and marketing techniques;

    (viii) train program and procurement officials regarding the policy of including 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement. This includes prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure acquisitions to facilitate competition by SDBs and 8(a)s, including their participation in the competition of multiple award requirements;

    (ix) provide the information required by the Department of Commerce when it requests data to develop the benchmarks used in the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994;

    (x) ensure that Directors of Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization carry out their responsibilities to maximize the participation of 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement and, in particular, ensure that the Directors report directly to the head of each department or agency as required by law; and

    (xi) as required by law, establish with the Small Business Administration small business goals to ensure that the government-wide goal for participation of small business concerns is not less than 23 percent of Federal prime contracts. Where feasible and consistent with the effective and efficient performance of its mission, each agency shall establish a goal of achieving a participation rate for SDBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value of prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total value of subcontract awards for each year. Each agency shall also establish a goal for awards made to 8(a) firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act \[[15 U.S.C. 637(a)][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]\]. These goals shall be considered the minimum goals and every effort shall be taken to exceed these goals wherever feasible.

    (b) Each department and agency with procurement authority shall:

    (i) develop a long-term comprehensive plan to implement the requirements of section 2(a) of this order and submit this plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days of the date of this order. The Director of OMB shall review each plan and report to the President on the sufficiency of each plan to carry out the terms of this order; and

    (ii) annually, by April 30 each year, assess its efforts and the results of those efforts to increase utilization of 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs as both prime contractors and subcontractors and report on those efforts to the President through the Director of OMB, who shall review the evaluations made of the agency assessments by the Small Business Administration.

    Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the Small Business Administration. The Administrator of the SBA shall:

    (a) evaluate on a semi-annual basis, using the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), the achievement of government-wide prime and subcontract goals and the actual prime and subcontract awards to 8(a)s and SDBs for each department and agency. The OMB shall review SBA’s evaluation;

    (b) ensure that Procurement Center Representatives receive adequate training regarding the section 8(a) and SDB programs and that they consistently and aggressively seek opportunities for maximizing the use of 8(a)s and SDBs in department and agency procurements; and

    (c) ensure that each department and agency’s small and disadvantaged business procurement goals as well as the amount of procurement of each department and agency with 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs is publicly available in an easily accessible and understandable format such as through publication on the Internet.

    Sec. 4. Federal Advertising. Each department or agency that contracts with businesses to develop advertising for the department or agency or to broadcast Federal advertising shall take an aggressive role in ensuring substantial minority-owned entities’ participation, including 8(a), SDB, and MBE, in Federal advertising-related procurements. Each department and agency shall ensure that all creation, placement, and transmission of Federal advertising is fully reflective of the Nation’s diversity. To achieve this diversity, special attention shall be given to ensure placement in publications and television and radio stations that reach specific ethnic and racial audiences. Each department and agency shall ensure that payment for Federal advertising is commensurate with fair market rates in the relevant market. Each department and agency shall structure advertising contracts as commercial acquisitions consistent with part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation processes and paperwork to enhance participation by 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs.

    Sec. 5. Information Technology. Each department and agency shall aggressively seek to ensure substantial 8(a), SDB, and MBE participation in procurements for and related to information technology, including procurements in the telecommunications industry. In so doing, the Chief Information Officer in each department and agency shall coordinate with procurement officials to implement this section.

    Sec. 6. General Services Administration Schedules. The SBA and the General Services Administration (GSA) shall act promptly to expand inclusion of 8(a)s and SDBs on GSA Schedules, and provide greater opportunities for 8(a) and SDB participation in orders under such schedules. The GSA should ensure that procurement and program officials at all levels that use GSA Schedules aggressively seek to utilize the Schedule contracts of 8(a)s and SDBs. The GSA shall allow agencies ordering from designated 8(a) firms under the Multiple Award Schedule to count those orders toward their 8(a) procurement goals.

    Sec. 7. Bundling Contracts. To the extent permitted by law, departments and agencies must submit to the SBA for review any contracts that are proposed to be bundled. The determination of the SBA with regard to the appropriateness of bundling in each instance must be carefully reviewed by the department or agency head, or his or her designee, and must be given due consideration. If there is an unresolvable conflict, then the SBA or the department or agency can seek assistance from the OMB.

    Sec. 8. Awards Program. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the SBA shall jointly undertake a feasibility study to determine the appropriateness of an awards program for executive departments and agencies who best exemplify the letter and intent of this order in increasing opportunities for 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs in Federal procurement. Such study shall be presented to the President within 90 days of the date of this order.

    Sec. 9. Applicability. Independent agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this order.

    Sec. 10. Administration, Enforcement, and Judicial Review.

 __Delegation of Authority To Establish Annual Goals for Participation of Small Business Concerns in Procurement Contracts__ 

    Memorandum of the President of the United States, June 6, 1990, 55 F.R. 27453–27455, provided:

    Memorandum for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 15(g) of the Small Business Act, as amended \[subsec. (g) of this section\], and [section 301 of Title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301] of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget the authority vested in the President to establish the annual goals required by Section 502 of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 ([P.L. 100–656][/us/pl/100/656]) \[amending this section\].

    You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

                              George Bush.

 __Continued Commitment to Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Small Women-Owned Businesses in Federal Procurement__ 

    Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 13, 1994, 59 F.R. 52397, provided:

    Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies \[and\] the President’s Management Council

    It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Such businesses should also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient contract performance. I am committed to the continuation of this policy. Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and section 8(a) of the Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 637(a)][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]), as necessary to achieve this policy objective.

    The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 \[[Pub. L. 103–355][/us/pl/103/355], see Short Title of 1994 Act note set out under [section 101 of Title 41][/us/usc/t41/s101], Public Contracts\] authorizes civilian agencies to utilize set-aside procurements for small disadvantaged businesses. The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses. These provisions, along with others in the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Department and agency heads should ensure that efforts to streamline acquisition procedures encourage the participation of these businesses in Federal procurements.

    This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

                              William J. Clinton.
