To fulfill this policy, departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government shall use all reasonable means to coordinate, create, and sustain policies and programs which promote investment in small businesses, including those investments which expand employment opportunities and which foster the effective and efficient use of human and natural resources in the economy of the Nation.
