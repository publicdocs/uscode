    (d) __Grant requirements__ 

        The Secretary shall require, as a condition to any grant (or amendment or modification thereof) made to an applicant under this section, that a sum equal to the amount of such grant be provided from sources other than the Federal Government: Provided, That the additional amount shall not include any amount of indirect costs or in-kind contributions paid for under any Federal program, nor shall indirect costs or in-kind contributions exceed 50 per centum of the non-Federal additional amount.
