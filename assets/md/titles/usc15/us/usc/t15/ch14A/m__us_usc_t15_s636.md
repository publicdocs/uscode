## § 636. Additional powers

    (a) __Loans to small business concerns; allowable purposes; qualified business; restrictions and limitations__ 

    The Administration is empowered to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts to make loans for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of land, material, supplies, equipment, and working capital, and to make loans to any qualified small business concern, including those owned by qualified Indian tribes, for purposes of this chapter. Such financings may be made either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis. These powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions, limitations, and provisions:

        (1) __In general.—__ 

            (A)  __Credit elsewhere__  __.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection if the applicant can obtain credit elsewhere. No immediate participation may be purchased unless it is shown that a deferred participation is not available; and no direct financing may be made unless it is shown that a participation is not available.

                (ii)  __Liquidity__  __.—__ 

                On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market.

            (B)  __Background checks__  __.—__ 

            Prior to the approval of any loan made pursuant to this subsection, or section 503 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 \[[15 U.S.C. 697][/us/usc/t15/s697]\], the Administrator may verify the applicant’s criminal background, or lack thereof, through the best available means, including, if possible, use of the National Crime Information Center computer system at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

            (C)  __Lending limits of lenders__  __.—__ 

            On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed the legal lending limit of the lender.

        (2) __Level of participation in guaranteed loans.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (D), and (E), in an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under this subsection (including a loan made under the Preferred Lenders Program), such participation by the Administration shall be equal to—

                (i) 75 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, if such balance exceeds $150,000; or

                (ii) 85 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, if such balance is less than or equal to $150,000.

            (B) __Reduced participation upon request.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                The guarantee percentage specified by subparagraph (A) for any loan under this subsection may be reduced upon the request of the participating lender.

                (ii)  __Prohibition__  __.—__ 

                The Administration shall not use the guarantee percentage requested by a participating lender under clause (i) as a criterion for establishing priorities in approving loan guarantee requests under this subsection.

            (C) __Interest rate under preferred lenders program.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                The maximum interest rate for a loan guaranteed under the Preferred Lenders Program shall not exceed the maximum interest rate, as determined by the Administration, applicable to other loans guaranteed under this subsection.

                (ii)  __Export-import bank lenders__  __.—__ 

                Any lender that is participating in the Delegated Authority Lender Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (or any successor to the Program) shall be eligible to participate in the Preferred Lenders Program.

                (iii)  __Preferred lenders program defined__  __.—__ 

                For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “Preferred Lenders Program” means any program established by the Administrator, as authorized under the proviso in [section 634(b)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s634/b/7], under which a written agreement between the lender and the Administration delegates to the lender—

                    (I) complete authority to make and close loans with a guarantee from the Administration without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration; and

                    (II) complete authority to service and liquidate such loans without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration for routine servicing and liquidation activities, but shall not take any actions creating an actual or apparent conflict of interest.

            (D)  __Participation under export working capital program__  __.—__ 

            In an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under the Export Working Capital Program established pursuant to paragraph (14)(A), such participation by the Administration shall be 90 percent.

            (E)  __Participation in international trade loan__  __.—__ 

            In an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under paragraph (16), the participation by the Administration may not exceed 90 percent.

        (3)

         No loan shall be made under this subsection—

            (A) if the total amount outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $3,750,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), except as provided in subparagraph (B);

            (B) if the total amount outstanding and committed (on a deferred basis) solely for the purposes provided in paragraph (16) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $4,500,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), of which not more than $4,000,000 may be used for working capital, supplies, or financings under paragraph (14) for export purposes; and

            (C) if effected either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate basis if the amount would exceed $350,000.

        (4) __Interest rates and prepayment charges.—__ 

            (A)  __Interest rates__  __.—__ 

            Notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution of any State or the laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, the maximum legal rate of interest on any financing made on a deferred basis pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed a rate prescribed by the Administration, and the rate of interest for the Administration’s share of any direct or immediate participation loan shall not exceed the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, and an additional amount as determined by the Administration, but not to exceed 1 per centum per annum: Provided, That for those loans to assist any public or private organization for the handicapped or to assist any handicapped individual as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection, the interest rate shall be 3 per centum per annum.

            (B) __Payment of accrued interest.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                Any bank or other lending institution making a claim for payment on the guaranteed portion of a loan made under this subsection shall be paid the accrued interest due on the loan from the earliest date of default to the date of payment of the claim at a rate not to exceed the rate of interest on the loan on the date of default, minus one percent.

                (ii)  __Loans sold on secondary market__  __.—__ 

                If a loan described in clause (i) is sold on the secondary market, the amount of interest paid to a bank or other lending institution described in that clause from the earliest date of default to the date of payment of the claim shall be no more than the agreed upon rate, minus one percent.

                (iii)  __Applicability__  __.—__ 

                Clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to loans made on or after October 1, 2000.

            (C)  __Prepayment charges__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                A borrower who prepays any loan guaranteed under this subsection shall remit to the Administration a subsidy recoupment fee calculated in accordance with clause (ii) if—

                    (II) the prepayment is voluntary;

                    (III) the amount of prepayment in any calendar year is more than 25 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan; and

                    (IV) the prepayment is made within the first 3 years after disbursement of the loan proceeds.

                (ii)  __Subsidy recoupment fee__  __.—__ 

                The subsidy recoupment fee charged under clause (i) shall be—

                    (I) 5 percent of the amount of prepayment, if the borrower prepays during the first year after disbursement;

                    (II) 3 percent of the amount of prepayment, if the borrower prepays during the second year after disbursement; and

                    (III) 1 percent of the amount of prepayment, if the borrower prepays during the third year after disbursement.

        (5) No such loans including renewals and extensions thereof may be made for a period or periods exceeding twenty-five years, except that such portion of a loan made for the purpose of acquiring real property or constructing, converting, or expanding facilities may have a maturity of twenty-five years plus such additional period as is estimated may be required to complete such construction, conversion, or expansion.

        (6)

         All loans made under this subsection shall be of such sound value or so secured as reasonably to assure repayment: Provided, however, That—

            (A) for loans to assist any public or private organization or to assist any handicapped individual as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of the applicant;

            (B) recognizing that greater risk may be associated with loans for energy measures as provided in paragraph (12) of this subsection, factors in determining “sound value” shall include, but not be limited to, quality of the product or service; technical qualifications of the applicant or his employees; sales projections; and the financial status of the business concern: Provided further, That such status need not be as sound as that required for general loans under this subsection; and  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The “; and” probably should be a period. </sup></sup> 

            (C) Repealed. [Pub. L. 97–35, title XIX, § 1910][/us/pl/97/35/s1910], Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 778][/us/stat/95/778].

            On that portion of the loan used to refinance existing indebtedness held by a bank or other lending institution, the Administration shall limit the amount of deferred participation to 80 per centum of the amount of the loan at the time of disbursement: Provided further, That any authority conferred by this subparagraph on the Administration shall be exercised solely by the Administration and shall not be delegated to other than Administration personnel.

        (7) The Administration may defer payments on the principal of such loans for a grace period and use such other methods as it deems necessary and appropriate to assure the successful establishment and operation of such concern.

        (11) The Administration may provide loans under this subsection to any small business concern, or to any qualified person seeking to establish such a concern when it determines that such loan will further the policies established in section 631(c)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, with particular emphasis on the preservation or establishment of small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals or owned by low-income individuals.

        (12)

            (A) The Administration may provide loans under this subsection to assist any small business concern, including start up, to enable such concern to design architecturally or engineer, manufacture, distribute, market, install, or service energy measures: Provided, however, That such loan proceeds shall not be used primarily for research and development.

The designation of a lender as a certified lender shall be suspended or revoked at any time that the Administration determines that the lender is not adhering to its rules and regulations or that the loss experience of the lender is excessive as compared to other lenders, but such suspension or revocation shall not affect any outstanding guarantee.

            (B) In order to encourage all lending institutions and other entities making loans authorized under this subsection to provide loans of $50,000 or less in guarantees to eligible small business loan applicants, the Administration shall develop and allow participating lenders to solely utilize a uniform and simplified loan form for such loans.

                If the Administrator does not approve or deny a request for approval of a liquidation plan within 10 business days of the date on which the request is made (or with respect to any routine liquidation activity under such a plan, within 5 business days) such request shall be deemed to be approved.

        (20)

            (A)

             The Administration is empowered to make loans either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis to small business concerns eligible for assistance under subsection (j)(10) and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]. Such assistance may be provided only if the Administration determines that—

                (i) the type and amount of such assistance requested by such concern is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from other sources;

                (ii) with such assistance such concern has a reasonable prospect for operating soundly and profitably within a reasonable period of time;

                (iii) the proceeds of such assistance will be used within a reasonable time for plant construction, conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or material or to supply such concern with working capital to be used in the manufacture of articles, equipment, supplies, or material for defense or civilian production or as may be necessary to insure a well-balanced national economy; and

                (iv) such assistance is of such sound value as reasonably to assure that the terms under which it is provided will not be breached by the small business concern.

            (B)

                (i) No loan shall be made under this paragraph if the total amount outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower would exceed $750,000.

                (iv)

                 Financings made pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following limitations:

                    (I) No immediate participation may be purchased unless it is shown that a deferred participation is not available.

                    (II) No direct financing may be made unless it is shown that a participation is unavailable.

            (C)

             A direct loan or the Administration’s share of an immediate participation loan made pursuant to this paragraph shall be any secured debt instrument—

                (i) that is subordinated by its terms to all other borrowings of the issuer;

                (ii) the rate of interest on which shall not exceed the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loan and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum;

                (iii) the term of which is not more than twenty-five years; and

                (iv) the principal on which is amortized at such rate as may be deemed appropriate by the Administration, and the interest on which is payable not less often than annually.

        (21)

            (A)

             The Administration may make loans on a guaranteed basis under the authority of this subsection—

                (i)

                    (I) the closure (or substantial reduction) of a Department of Defense installation; or

                    (II) the termination (or substantial reduction) of a Department of Defense program on which such small business was a prime contractor or subcontractor (or supplier) at any tier; or

                (ii) to a qualified individual or a veteran seeking to establish (or acquire) and operate a small business concern.

            (B) Recognizing that greater risk may be associated with a loan to a small business concern described in subparagraph (A)(i), any reasonable doubts concerning the firm’s proposed business plan for transition to nondefense-related markets shall be resolved in favor of the loan applicant when making any determination regarding the sound value of the proposed loan in accordance with paragraph (6).

            (C) Loans pursuant to this paragraph shall be authorized in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts for the purposes of loans under this paragraph.

            (D)

             For purposes of this paragraph a qualified individual is—

                (i) a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, honorably discharged from active duty involuntarily or pursuant to a program providing bonuses or other inducements to encourage voluntary separation or early retirement;

                (ii) a civilian employee of the Department of Defense involuntarily separated from Federal service or retired pursuant to a program offering inducements to encourage early retirement; or

                (iii) an employee of a prime contractor, subcontractor, or supplier at any tier of a Department of Defense program whose employment is involuntarily terminated (or voluntarily terminated pursuant to a program offering inducements to encourage voluntary separation or early retirement) due to the termination (or substantial reduction) of a Department of Defense program.

            (E)  __Job creation and community benefit__  __.—__ 

            In providing assistance under this paragraph, the Administration shall develop procedures to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that such assistance is used for projects that—

                 have the greatest potential for—

                    (I) creating new jobs for individuals whose employment is involuntarily terminated due to reductions in Federal defense expenditures; or

                    (II) preventing the loss of jobs by employees of small business concerns described in subparagraph (A)(i); and

                (ii) have substantial potential for stimulating new economic activity in communities most affected by reductions in Federal defense expenditures.

        (22) The Administration is authorized to permit participating lenders to impose and collect a reasonable penalty fee on late payments of loans guaranteed under this subsection in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of the monthly loan payment per month plus interest.

        (23) __Yearly fee.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            With respect to each loan approved under this subsection, the Administration shall assess, collect, and retain a fee, not to exceed 0.55 percent per year of the outstanding balance of the deferred participation share of the loan, in an amount established once annually by the Administration in the Administration’s annual budget request to Congress, as necessary to reduce to zero the cost to the Administration of making guarantees under this subsection. As used in this paragraph, the term “cost” has the meaning given that term in [section 661a of title 2][/us/usc/t2/s661a].

            (B)  __Payer__  __.—__ 

            The yearly fee assessed under subparagraph (A) shall be payable by the participating lender and shall not be charged to the borrower.

        (D)

         shall notwithstanding the provisions of any other law and upon presentation by the applicant of proof of loss or damage or injury and a bona fide estimate of cost of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement, cancel the principal of any loan made to cover a loss or damage or injury resulting from such disaster, except that—

        (1) The Administration also is empowered to make, participate (on an immediate basis) in, or guarantee loans, repayable in not more than fifteen years, to any small business concern, or to any qualified person seeking to establish such a concern, when it determines that such loans will further the policies established in section 631(b) 2 of this title, with particular emphasis on the preservation or establishment of small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals, or owned by low-income individuals: Provided, however, That no such loans shall be made, participated in, or guaranteed if the total of such Federal assistance to a single borrower outstanding at any one time would exceed $100,000. The Administration may defer payments on the principal of such loans for a grace period and use such other methods as it deems necessary and appropriate to assure the successful establishment and operation of such concern. The Administration may, in its discretion, as a condition of such financial assistance, require that the borrower take steps to improve his management skills by participating in a management training program approved by the Administration: Provided, however, That any management training program so approved must be of sufficient scope and duration to provide reasonable opportunity for the individuals served to develop entrepreneurial and managerial self-sufficiency.

        (2) The Administration shall encourage, as far as possible, the participation of the private business community in the program of assistance to such concerns, and shall seek to stimulate new private lending activities to such concerns through the use of the loan guarantees, participations in loans, and pooling arrangements authorized by this subsection.

        (3) To insure an equitable distribution between urban and rural areas for loans between $3,500 and $100,000 made under this subsection, the Administration is authorized to use the agencies and agreements and delegations developed under title III of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended \[[42 U.S.C. 2841][/us/usc/t42/s2841] et seq.\], as it shall determine necessary.

        (4) The Administration shall provide for the continuing evaluation of programs under this subsection, including full information on the location, income characteristics, and types of businesses and individuals assisted, and on new private lending activity stimulated, and the results of such evaluation together with recommendations shall be included in the report required by [section 639(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s639/a].

        (5)

         Loans made pursuant to this subsection (including immediate participation in and guarantees of such loans) shall have such terms and conditions as the Administration shall determine, subject to the following limitations—

            (A) there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan;

            (B) the financial assistance is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from private sources or other Federal, State, or local programs;

            (C) the amount of the loan, together with other funds available, is adequate to assure completion of the project or achievement of the purposes for which the loan is made;

            (D) the loan bears interest at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding Treasury obligations of comparable maturity, plus (ii) such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes: Provided, however, That the rate of interest charged on loans made in redevelopment areas designated under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 \[[42 U.S.C. 3121][/us/usc/t42/s3121] et seq.\] shall not exceed the rate currently applicable to new loans made under section 201 of that Act \[[42 U.S.C. 3141][/us/usc/t42/s3141]\]; and

            (E) fees not in excess of amounts necessary to cover administrative expenses and probable losses may be required on loan guarantees.

        (6) The Administration shall take such steps as may be necessary to insure that, in any fiscal year, at least 50 per centum of the amounts loaned or guaranteed pursuant to this subsection are allotted to small business concerns located in urban areas identified by the Administration as having high concentrations of unemployed or low-income individuals or to small business concerns owned by low-income individuals. The Administration shall define the meaning of low income as it applies to owners of small business concerns eligible to be assisted under this subsection.

        (7) No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection where the Administration determines that the assistance will be used in relocating establishments from one area to another if such relocation would result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location.

    (j) __Financial assistance for projects providing technical or management assistance; areas of high concentration of unemployment or low-income; preferences; manner and method of payment; accessible services; program evaluations; establishment of development program; coordination of policies__ 

        (1) The Administration shall provide financial assistance to public or private organizations to pay all or part of the cost of projects designed to provide technical or management assistance to individuals or enterprises eligible for assistance under subsection (i), paragraph (10) of this subsection; and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], with special attention to small businesses located in areas of high concentration of unemployed or low-income individuals, to small businesses eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

        (2)

         Financial assistance under this subsection may be provided for projects, including, but not limited to—

            (A) planning and research, including feasibility studies and market research;

            (B) the identification and development of new business opportunities;

            (D) the establishment and strengthening of business service agencies, including trade associations and cooperatives; and

            (E) the furnishing of business counseling, management training, and legal and other related services, with special emphasis on the development of management training programs using the resources of the business community, including the development of management training opportunities in existing business, and with emphasis in all cases upon providing management training of sufficient scope and duration to develop entrepreneurial and managerial self-sufficiency on the part of the individuals served.

        (3) The Administration shall encourage the placement of subcontracts by businesses with small business concerns located in areas of high concentration of unemployed or low-income individuals, with small businesses owned by low-income individuals, and with small businesses eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]. The Administration may provide incentives and assistance to such businesses that will aid in the training and upgrading of potential subcontractors or other small business concerns eligible for assistance under subsections (i) and (j), and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

        (4) The Administration shall give preference to projects which promote the ownership, participation in ownership, or management of small businesses owned by low-income individuals and small businesses eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

        (5) The financial assistance authorized for projects under this subsection includes assistance advanced by grant, agreement, or contract.

        (6) The Administration is authorized to make payments under grants and contracts entered into under this subsection in lump sum or installments, and in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in the case of grants, with necessary adjustments on account of overpayments or underpayments.

        (7) To the extent feasible, services under this subsection shall be provided in a location which is easily accessible to the individuals and small business concerns served.

        (9) The Administration shall take such steps as may be necessary and appropriate, in coordination and cooperation with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies, to insure that contracts, subcontracts, and deposits made by the Federal Government or with programs aided with Federal funds are placed in such way as to further the purposes of subsections (i) and (j) and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

        (10)

         There is established within the Administration a small business and capital ownership development program (hereinafter referred to as the “Program”) which shall provide assistance exclusively for small business concerns eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]. The program, and all other services and activities authorized under this subsection and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], shall be managed by the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development under the supervision of, and responsible to, the Administrator.

            (A)

             The Program shall—

                (i) assist small business concerns participating in the Program (either through public or private organizations) to develop and maintain comprehensive business plans which set forth the Program Participant’s specific business targets, objectives, and goals developed and maintained in conformity with subparagraph (D). <sup>\[12\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 12 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

                (ii) provide for such other nonfinancial services as deemed necessary for the establishment, preservation, and growth of small business concerns participating in the Program, including but not limited to (I) loan packaging, (II) financial counseling, (III) accounting and bookkeeping assistance, (IV) marketing assistance, and (V) management assistance;

                (iii) assist small business concerns participating in the Program to obtain equity and debt financing;

                (iv) establish regular performance monitoring and reporting systems for small business concerns participating in the Program to assure compliance with their business plans;

                (v) analyze and report the causes of success and failure of small business concerns participating in the Program; and

                (vi) provide assistance necessary to help small business concerns participating in the Program to procure surety bonds, with such assistance including, but not limited to, (I) the preparation of application forms required to receive a surety bond, (II) special management and technical assistance designed to meet the specific needs of small business concerns participating in the Program and which have received or are applying to receive a surety bond, and (III) preparation of all forms necessary to receive a surety bond guarantee from the Administration pursuant to title IV, part B of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 \[[15 U.S.C. 694a][/us/usc/t15/s694a] et seq.\].

            (B) Small business concerns eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] shall participate in the Program.

            (C)

                (i)

                 A small business concern participating in any program or activity conducted under the authority of this paragraph or eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] on September 1, 1988, shall be permitted continued participation and eligibility in such program or activity for a period of time which is the greater of—

                    (I) 9 years less the number of years since the award of its first contract pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]; or

                    (II) its original fixed program participation term (plus any extension thereof) assigned prior to November 15, 1988, plus eighteen months.

                (ii) Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be deemed to prevent the Administration from instituting a termination or graduation pursuant to subparagraph (F) or (H) for issues unrelated to the expiration of any time period limitation.

            (D)

                (i) Promptly after certification under paragraph (11) a Program Participant shall submit a business plan (hereinafter referred to as the “plan”) as described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph for review by the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned to assist such Program Participant. The Business Opportunity Specialist shall have a Level I Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (or any successor certification) or the equivalent Department of Defense certification, except that a Business Opportunity Specialist serving at the time of the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 may continue to serve as a Business Opportunity Specialist for a period of 5 years beginning on that date of enactment without such a certification. The plan may be a revision of a preliminary business plan submitted by the Program Participant or required by the Administration as a part of the application for certification under this section and shall be designed to result in the Program Participant eliminating the conditions or circumstances upon which the Administration determined eligibility pursuant to [section 637(a)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/6]. Such plan, and subsequent modifications submitted under clause (iii) of this subparagraph, shall be approved by the business opportunity specialist prior to the Program Participant being eligible for award of a contract pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

                (ii)

                 The plans submitted under this subparagraph shall include the following:

                    (I) An analysis of market potential, competitive environment, and other business analyses estimating the Program Participant’s prospects for profitable operations during the term of program participation and after graduation.

                    (II) An analysis of the Program Participant’s strengths and weaknesses with particular attention to correcting any financial, managerial, technical, or personnel conditions which are likely to impede the small business concern from receiving contracts other than those awarded under [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

                    (III) Specific targets, objectives, and goals, for the business development of the Program Participant during the next and succeeding years utilizing the results of the analyses conducted pursuant to subclauses (I) and (II).

                    (IV) A transition management plan outlining specific steps to assure profitable business operations after graduation (to be incorporated into the Program Participant’s plan during the first year of the transitional stage of Program participation).

                    (V) Estimates of contract awards pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] and from other sources, which the Program Participant will require to meet the specific targets, objectives, and goals for the years covered by its plan. The estimates established shall be consistent with the provisions of subparagraph (I) and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

                (iii) Each Program Participant shall annually review its currently approved plan with its Business Opportunity Specialist and modify such plan as may be appropriate. Any modified plan shall be submitted to the Administration for approval. The currently approved plan shall be considered valid until such time as a modified plan is approved by the Business Opportunity Specialist. Annual reviews pertaining to years in the transitional stage of program participation shall require, as appropriate, a written verification that such Program Participant has complied with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

                (iv)

                 Each Program Participant shall annually forecast its needs for contract awards under [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] for the next program year and the succeeding program year during the review of its business plan, conducted pursuant to clause (iii). Such forecast shall be known as the section 8(a) \[[15 U.S.C. 637(a)][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]\] contract support level and shall be included in the Program Participant’s business plan. Such forecast shall include—

                    (I) the aggregate dollar value of contract support to be sought on a noncompetitive basis under [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], reflecting compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (I) relating to attaining business activity from sources other than contracts awarded pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a],

                    (II) the types of contract opportunities being sought, identified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or otherwise,

                    (III) an estimate of the dollar value of contract support to be sought on a competitive basis, and

                    (IV) such other information as may be requested by the Business Opportunity Specialist to provide effective business development assistance to the Program Participant.

            (E)

             A small business concern participating in the program conducted under the authority of this paragraph and eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] shall be denied all such assistance if such concern—

                (i) voluntarily elects not to continue participation;

                (ii) completes the period of Program participation as prescribed by paragraph (15);

                (iii) is terminated pursuant to a termination proceeding conducted in accordance with [section 637(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/9]; or

                (iv) is graduated pursuant to a graduation proceeding conducted in accordance with [section 637(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/9].

            (F)

             For purposes of this section and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], the term “terminated” and the term “termination” means the total denial or suspension of assistance under this paragraph or under [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] prior to the graduation of the participating small business concern or prior to the expiration of the maximum program participation term. An action for termination shall be based upon good cause, including—

                (i) the failure by such concern to maintain its eligibility for Program participation;

                (ii) the failure of the concern to engage in business practices that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of unjustified delinquent performance or terminations for default with respect to contracts awarded under the authority of [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a];

                (iii) a demonstrated pattern of failing to make required submissions or responses to the Administration in a timely manner;

                (iv) the willful violation of any rule or regulation of the Administration pertaining to material issues;

                (v) the debarment of the concern or its disadvantaged owners by any agency pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation); or

                (vi) the conviction of the disadvantaged owner or an officer of the concern for any offense indicating a lack of business integrity including any conviction for embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or violation of [section 645 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s645]. For purposes of this clause, no termination action shall be taken with respect to a disadvantaged owner solely because of the conviction of an officer of the concern (who is other than a disadvantaged owner) unless such owner conspired with, abetted, or otherwise knowingly acquiesced in the activity or omission that was the basis of such officer’s conviction.

            (G) The Director of the Division may initiate a termination proceeding by recommending such action to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. Whenever the Associate Administrator, or a designee of such officer, determines such termination is appropriate, within 15 days after making such a determination the Program Participant shall be provided a written notice of intent to terminate, specifying the reasons for such action. No Program Participant shall be terminated from the Program pursuant to subparagraph (F) without first being afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with [section 637(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/9].

            (H) For the purposes of this subsection and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] the term “graduated” or “graduation” means that the Program Participant is recognized as successfully completing the program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives, and goals contained in the concern’s business plan thereby demonstrating its ability to compete in the marketplace without assistance under this section or [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

            (I)

                (i) During the developmental stage of its participation in the Program, a Program Participant shall take all reasonable efforts within its control to attain the targets contained in its business plan for contracts awarded other than pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] (hereinafter referred to as “business activity targets.”). Such efforts shall be made a part of the business plan and shall be sufficient in scope and duration to satisfy the Administration that the Program Participant will engage a reasonable marketing strategy that will maximize its potential to achieve its business activity targets.

                (ii) During the transitional stage of the Program a Program Participant shall be subject to regulations regarding business activity targets that are promulgated by the Administration pursuant to clause (iii);

                (iii)

                 The regulations referred to in clause (ii) shall:

                    (I) establish business activity targets applicable to Program Participants during the fifth year and each succeeding year of Program Participation; such targets, for such period of time, shall reflect a reasonably consistent increase in contracts awarded other than pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], expressed as a percentage of total sales; when promulgating business activity targets the Administration may establish modified targets for Program Participants that have participated in the Program for a period of longer than four years on June 1, 1989;

                    (II) require a Program Participant to attain its business activity targets;

                    (III) provide that, before the receipt of any contract to be awarded pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], the Program Participant (if it is in the transitional stage) must certify that it has complied with the regulations promulgated pursuant to subclause (II), or that it is in compliance with such remedial measures as may have been ordered pursuant to regulations issued under subclause (V);

                    (IV) require the Administration to review each Program Participant’s performance regarding attainment of business activity targets during periodic reviews of such Participant’s business plan; and

                    (V) authorize the Administration to take appropriate remedial measures with respect to a Program Participant that has failed to attain a required business activity target for the purpose of reducing such Participant’s dependence on contracts awarded pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]; such remedial actions may include, but are not limited to assisting the Program Participant to expand the dollar volume of its competitive business activity or limiting the dollar volume of contracts awarded to the Program Participant pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]; except for actions that would constitute a termination, remedial measures taken pursuant to this subclause shall not be reviewable pursuant to [section 637(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/9].

            (J)

                (i) The Administration shall conduct an evaluation of a Program Participant’s eligibility for continued participation in the Program whenever it receives specific and credible information alleging that such Program Participant no longer meets the requirements for Program eligibility. Upon making a finding that a Program Participant is no longer eligible, the Administration shall initiate a termination proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (F). A Program Participant’s eligibility for award of any contract under the authority of [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] may be suspended pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).

                (ii)

                    (I) Except as authorized by subclauses (II) or (III), no award shall be made pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] to a concern other than a small business concern.

                    (II) In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe), each firm’s size shall be independently determined without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.

                    (III) Any joint venture established under the authority of [section 602(b) of Public Law 100–656][/us/pl/100/656/s602/b], the “Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988”, shall be eligible for award of a contract pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

        (11)

            (A) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development shall be responsible for coordinating and formulating policies relating to Federal assistance to small business concerns eligible for assistance under subsection (i) and small business concerns eligible to receive contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a].

            (B)

                (i) Except as provided in clause (iii), no individual who was determined pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] to be socially and economically disadvantaged before August 15, 1989, shall be permitted to assert such disadvantage with respect to any other concern making application for certification after August 15, 1989.

                (ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), any individual upon whom eligibility is based pursuant to [section 637(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/4] shall be permitted to assert such eligibility for only one small business concern.

                (iii)

                 A socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe may own more than one small business concern eligible for assistance pursuant to paragraph (10) and [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a] if—

                    (I) the Indian tribe does not own another firm in the same industry which has been determined to be eligible to receive contracts under this program, and

                    (II) the individuals responsible for the management and daily operations of the concern do not manage more than two Program Participants.

            (C) No concern, previously eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a], shall be subsequently recertified for program participation if its prior participation in the program was concluded for any of the reasons described in paragraph (10)(E).

            (D) A concern eligible for the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection shall remain eligible for such contracts if there is a transfer of ownership and control (as defined pursuant to [section 637(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/4]) to individuals who are determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a]. In the event of such a transfer, the concern, if not terminated or graduated, shall be eligible for a period of continued participation in the program not to exceed the time limitations prescribed in paragraph (15).

            (E) There is established a Division of Program Certification and Eligibility (hereinafter referred to in this paragraph as the “Division”) that shall be made part of the Office of Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. The Division shall be headed by a Director who shall report directly to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. The Division shall establish field offices within such regional offices of the Administration as may be necessary to perform efficiently its functions and responsibilities.

            (F)

             Subject to the provisions of [section 637(a)(9) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a/9], the functions and responsibility of the Division are to—

                (i) receive, review and evaluate applications for certification pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5), (6) and (7) of [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a];

                (ii) advise each program applicant within 15 days after the receipt of an application as to whether such application is complete and suitable for evaluation and, if not, what matters must be rectified;

                (iii) render recommendations on such applications to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development;

                (iv) review and evaluate financial statements and other submissions from concerns participating in the program established by paragraph (10) to ascertain continued eligibility to receive subcontracts pursuant to [section 637(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637/a];

                (v) make a request for the initiation of termination or graduation proceedings, as appropriate, to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development;

                (vi) make recommendations to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development concerning protests from applicants that have been denied program admission;

                (vii) decide protests regarding the status of a concern as a disadvantaged concern for purposes of any program or activity conducted under the authority of subsection (d) of [section 637 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s637], or any other provision of Federal law that references such subsection for a definition of program eligibility; and

                (viii) implement such policy directives as may be issued by the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development pursuant to subparagraph (I) regarding, among other things, the geographic distribution of concerns to be admitted to the program and the industrial make-up of such concerns.

            (G)

             An applicant shall not be denied admission into the program established by paragraph (10) due solely to a determination by the Division that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist in the development of such concern unless—

                (i) the Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or

                (ii) the purchases of such products or services by the Federal Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other Program Participants providing the same or similar items or services.

            (H) Not later than 90 days after receipt of a completed application for Program certification, the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development shall certify a small business concern as a Program Participant or shall deny such application.

            (I)

             Thirty days before the conclusion of each fiscal year, the Director of the Division shall review all concerns that have been admitted into the Program during the preceding 12-month period. The review shall ascertain the number of entrants, their geographic distribution and industrial classification.
