## § 651. National small business tree planting program

    (a) __Authorization of grants and contracts with States__ 

        The Administrator is authorized to make grants to or to enter into contracts with any State for the purpose of contracting with small businesses to plant trees on land owned or controlled by such State or local government. The Administrator shall require as a condition of any grant (or amendment or modification thereof) under this section that the applicant also contribute to the project a sum equal to at least 25 per centum of a particular project cost from sources other than the Federal Government. Such non-Federal money may include inkind contributions, including the cost or value of providing care and maintenance for a period of three years after the planting of the trees, but shall not include any value attributable to the land on which the trees are to be planted, nor may any part of any grant be used to pay for land or land charges: Provided, That not less than one-half of the amounts appropriated under this section shall be allocated to each State, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on the basis of the population in each area as compared to the total population in all areas as provided by the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce in the annual population estimate or the decennial census, whichever is most current. The Administrator may give a priority in awarding the remaining one-half of appropriated amounts to applicants who agree to contribute more than the requisite 25 per centum, and shall give priority to a proposal to restore an area determined to be a major disaster by the President on a date not more than three years prior to the fiscal year for which the application is made.

    (b) __Establishment by Administrator__ 

        In order to accomplish the objectives of this section, the Administrator, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, shall be responsible for formulating a national small business tree planting program. Based on this program, a State may submit a detailed proposal for tree planting by contract.

    (c) __Utilization of small business concerns in implementing program__ 

        To encourage and develop the capacity of small business concerns, to utilize this important segment of our economy, and to permit rapid increases in employment opportunities in local communities, grantees are directed to utilize small business contractors or concerns in connection with the program established by this section, and shall, to the extent practicable, divide the project to allow more than one small business concern to perform the work under the project.

    (d) __Cooperation of Federal agencies; technical services__ 

        For purposes of this section, agencies of the Federal Government are hereby authorized to cooperate with all grantees and with State foresters or other appropriate officials by providing without charge, in furtherance of this program, technical services with respect to the planting and growing of such trees.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the objectives of this section, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1991 and $30,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1995 through 1997, and all of such sums may remain available until expended.

    (f) __Rules and regulations__ 

        Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation, the administration shall publish in the Federal Register proposed rules and regulations implementing this section within sixty days after November 5, 1990, and shall publish final rules and regulations within one hundred and twenty days of November 5, 1990.
