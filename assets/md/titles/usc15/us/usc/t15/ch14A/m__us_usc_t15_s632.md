## § 632. Definitions

    (a) __Small business concerns__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For the purposes of this chapter, a small-business concern, including but not limited to enterprises that are engaged in the business of production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, agriculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries, shall be deemed to be one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation: Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, an agricultural enterprise shall be deemed to be a small business concern if it (including its affiliates) has annual receipts not in excess of $750,000.

        (2) __Establishment of size standards__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In addition to the criteria specified in paragraph (1), the Administrator may specify detailed definitions or standards by which a business concern may be determined to be a small business concern for the purposes of this chapter or any other Act.

            (B) __Additional criteria__ 

                The standards described in paragraph (1) may utilize number of employees, dollar volume of business, net worth, net income, a combination thereof, or other appropriate factors.

            (C) __Requirements__ 

            Unless specifically authorized by statute, no Federal department or agency may prescribe a size standard for categorizing a business concern as a small business concern, unless such proposed size standard—

                (i) is proposed after an opportunity for public notice and comment;

                (ii)

                 provides for determining—

                    (I) the size of a manufacturing concern as measured by the manufacturing concern’s average employment based upon employment during each of the manufacturing concern’s pay periods for the preceding 12 months;

                    (II) the size of a business concern providing services on the basis of the annual average gross receipts of the business concern over a period of not less than 3 years;

                    (III) the size of other business concerns on the basis of data over a period of not less than 3 years; or

                    (IV) other appropriate factors; and

                (iii) is approved by the Administrator.

        (3) __Variation by industry and consideration of other factors__

        (4) __Exclusion of certain security expenses from consideration for purpose of small business size standards__ 

            (A) __Determination required__ 

                Not later than 30 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall review the application of size standards established pursuant to paragraph (2) to small business concerns that are performing contracts in qualified areas and determine whether it would be fair and appropriate to exclude from consideration in the average annual gross receipts of such small business concerns any payments made to such small business concerns by Federal agencies to reimburse such small business concerns for the cost of subcontracts entered for the sole purpose of providing security services in a qualified area.

            (B) __Action required__ 

            Not later than 60 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall either—

                (i) initiate an adjustment to the size standards, as described in subparagraph (A), if the Administrator determines that such an adjustment would be fair and appropriate; or

        (5) __Alternative Size Standard__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Administrator shall establish an alternative size standard for applicants for business loans under [section 636(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s636/a] and applicants for development company loans under title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 ([15 U.S.C. 695][/us/usc/t15/s695] et seq.), that uses maximum tangible net worth and average net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards.

            (B) __Interim rule__ 

            Until the date on which the alternative size standard established under subparagraph (A) is in effect, an applicant for a business loan under [section 636(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s636/a] or an applicant for a development company loan under title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 may be eligible for such a loan if—

            In carrying out this subsection, the Administrator may establish or approve a single size standard for a grouping of 4-digit North American Industry Classification System codes only if the Administrator makes publicly available, not later than the date on which such size standard is established or approved, a justification demonstrating that such size standard is appropriate for each individual industry classification included in the grouping.
