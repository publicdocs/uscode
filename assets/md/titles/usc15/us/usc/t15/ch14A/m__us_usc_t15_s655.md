    (d) __Purpose of awards__ 

    Awards made under this section shall be for the purpose of increasing access by small businesses to on-line data base services that provide technical and business information, and access to technical experts, in a wide range of technologies, through such activities as—

        (2) training small businesses in the use of the data base services; and

        (3) establishing a public point of access to the data base services.

        Activities described in paragraphs (1) through (3) may be carried out through contract with a private entity.

    (e) __Renewal of awards__ 

        Awards previously made under section 648a  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title may be renewed under this section.

    (f) __Interim report__ 

        Two years after the date on which the first award was issued under section 648a 1 of this title, the General Accounting Office shall submit to the Committee on Small Business and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Small Business and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, an interim report on the implementation of the program under such section and this section, including the judgments of the participating Centers as to its effect on small business productivity and innovation.

    (i) __Funding from other sources; employment of Centers by Federal agencies__ 

        Centers are encouraged to seek funding from Federal and non-Federal sources other than those provided for in this section to assist small businesses in the identification of appropriate technologies to fill their needs, the transfer of technologies from Federal laboratories, public and private universities, and other public and private institutions, the analysis of commercial opportunities represented by such technologies, and such other functions as the development, business planning, market research, and financial packaging required for commercialization. Insofar as such Centers pursue these activities, Federal agencies are encouraged to employ these Centers to interface with small businesses for such purposes as facilitating small business participation in Federal procurement and fostering commercialization of Federally-funded research and development.
