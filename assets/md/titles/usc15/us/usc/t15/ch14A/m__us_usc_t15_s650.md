    (a) __In general__ 

    The Administrator is authorized—

        (1) to supervise the safety and soundness of small business lending companies and non-Federally regulated lenders;

        (2) with respect to small business lending companies to set capital standards to regulate, to examine, and to enforce laws governing such companies, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter; and

        (3) with respect to non-Federally regulated lenders to regulate, to examine, and to enforce laws governing the lending activities of such lenders under [section 636(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s636/a] in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.

    (b) __Capital directive__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the Administrator determines that a small business lending company is being operated in an imprudent manner, the Administrator may, in addition to any other action authorized by law, issue a directive to such company to increase capital to such level as the Administrator determines will result in the safe and sound operation of such company.

        (2) __Delegation__ 

            The Administrator may not delegate the authority granted under paragraph (1) except to an Associate Deputy Administrator.

        (3) __Regulations__ 

            The Administrator shall issue regulations outlining the conditions under which the Administrator may determine the level of capital pursuant to paragraph (1).

    (c) __Civil action__ 

        If a small business lending company violates this chapter, the Administrator may institute a civil action in an appropriate district court to terminate the rights, privileges, and franchises of the company under this chapter.

    (d) __Revocation or suspension of loan authority__ 

        (1)

         The Administrator may revoke or suspend the authority of a small business lending company or a non-Federally regulated lender to make, service or liquidate business loans authorized by [section 636(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s636/a]—

            (A) for false statements knowingly made in any written submission required under this chapter;

            (B) for omission of a material fact from any written submission required under this chapter;

            (C) for willful or repeated violation of this chapter;

            (D) for willful or repeated violation of any condition imposed by the Administrator with respect to any application, request, or agreement under this chapter; or

            (E) for violation of any cease and desist order of the Administrator under this section.

        (2)

         The Administrator may revoke or suspend authority under paragraph (1) only after a hearing under subsection (f). The Administrator may delegate power to revoke or suspend authority under paragraph (1) only to the Deputy Administrator and only if the Administrator is unavailable to take such action.

            (A) The Administrator, after finding extraordinary circumstances and in order to protect the financial or legal position of the United States, may issue a suspension order without conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection (f). If the Administrator issues a suspension under the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall within two business days follow the procedures set forth in subsection (f).

            (B) Any suspension under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect until the Administrator makes a decision pursuant to subparagraph (4) to permanently revoke the authority of the small business lending company or non-Federally regulated lender, suspend the authority for a time certain, or terminate the suspension.

        (3) The small business lending company or non-Federally regulated lender must notify borrowers of a revocation and that a new entity has been appointed to service their loans. The Administrator or an employee of the Administration designated by the Administrator may provide such notice to the borrower.

        (4) Any revocation or suspension under paragraph (1) shall be made by the Administrator except that the Administrator shall delegate to an administrative law judge as that term is used in [section 3105 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3105] the authority to conduct any hearing required under subsection (f). The Administrator shall base the decision to revoke on the record of the hearing.

    (e) __Cease and desist order__ 

        (1) Where a small business lending company, a non-Federally regulated lender, or other person violates this chapter or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of this chapter, the Administrator may order, after the opportunity for hearing pursuant to subsection (f), the company, lender, or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administrator may delegate the authority under the preceding sentence only to the Deputy Administrator and only if the Administrator is unavailable to take such action.

        (2) The Administrator, after finding extraordinary circumstances and in order to protect the financial or legal position of the United States, may issue a cease and desist order without conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection (f). If the Administrator issues a cease and desist order under the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall within two business days follow the procedures set forth in subsection (f).

        (4) A cease and desist order under this subsection may also provide for the suspension of authority to lend in subsection (d).

    (f) __Procedure for revocation or suspension of loan authority and for cease and desist order__ 

        (1) Before revoking or suspending authority under subsection (d) or issuing a cease and desist order under subsection (e), the Administrator shall serve an order to show cause upon the small business lending company, non-Federally regulated lender, or other person why an order revoking or suspending the authority or a cease and desist order should not be issued. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administrator and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before an administrative law judge at a time and place stated in the order. Such hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of sections 554, 556, and 557 of title 5. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administrator determines that an order revoking or suspending the authority or a cease and desist order should be issued, the Administrator shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administrator and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the small business lending company, non-Federally regulated lender, or other person involved.

        (2) Witnesses summoned before the Administrator shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.

        (3) A cease and desist order, suspension or revocation issued by the Administrator, after the hearing under this subsection is final agency action for purposes of chapter 7 of title 5. An adversely aggrieved party shall have 20 days from the date of issuance of the cease and desist order, suspension or revocation, to seek judicial review in an appropriate district court.
