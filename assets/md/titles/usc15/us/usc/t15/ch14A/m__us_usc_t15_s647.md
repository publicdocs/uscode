    (a) __General prohibition; exception__ 

        The Administration shall not duplicate the work or activity of any other department or agency of the Federal Government,, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  and nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize any such duplication unless such work or activity is expressly provided for in this chapter. If loan applications are being refused or loans denied by such other department or agency responsible for such work or activity due to administrative withholding from obligation or withholding from apportionment, or due to administratively declared moratorium, then, for purposes of this section, no duplication shall be deemed to have occurred.

    (b) __Definitions__

        (1) “agricultural enterprises” means those businesses engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and

        (2) “credit elsewhere” means the availability of sufficient credit from non-Federal sources at reasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing private rates and terms in the community in or near where the concern transacts business for similar purposes and periods of time.
