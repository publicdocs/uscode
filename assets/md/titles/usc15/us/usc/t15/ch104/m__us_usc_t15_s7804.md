## § 7804. Actions by States

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1) __Civil actions__

            (A) enjoin that practice;

            (B) enforce compliance with this chapter; or

                (ii) a copy of the complaint for that action.

            (B) __Exemption__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to the filing of an action by an attorney general of a State under this subsection, if the attorney general determines that it is not feasible to provide the notice described in that subparagraph before filing of the action. In such case, the attorney general of a State shall provide notice and a copy of the complaint to the Commission at the same time as the attorney general files the action.

    (b) __Intervention__

            On receiving notice under subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall have the right to intervene in the action that is the subject of the notice.

        (2) __Effect of intervention__ 

        If the Commission intervenes in an action under subsection (a), it shall have the right—

            (A) to be heard with respect to any matter that arises in that action; and

            (B) to file a petition for appeal.

    (c) __Construction__ 

    For purposes of bringing any civil action under subsection (a), nothing in this chapter  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  shall be construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of that State to—

        (1) conduct investigations;

        (2) administer oaths or affirmations; or

        (3) compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence.

    (d) __Actions by the Commission__ 

        In any case in which an action is instituted by or on behalf of the Commission for a violation of [section 7802 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7802], no State may, during the pendency of that action, institute an action under subsection (a) against any defendant named in the complaint in that action.

    (e) __Venue__ 

        Any action brought under subsection (a) may be brought in the district court of the United States that meets applicable requirements relating to venue under [section 1391 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1391].

    (f) __Service of process__ 

    In an action brought under subsection (a), process may be served in any district in which the defendant—

        (1) is an inhabitant; or

        (2) may be found.

([Pub. L. 108–304, § 5][/us/pl/108/304/s5], Sept. 24, 2004, [118 Stat. 1127][/us/stat/118/1127].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “this title” and was translated as reading “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 108–304][/us/pl/108/304], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 108–304][/us/pl/108/304] does not contain titles.
