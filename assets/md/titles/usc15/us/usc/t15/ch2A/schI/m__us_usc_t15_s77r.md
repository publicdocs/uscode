## § 77r. Exemption from State regulation of securities offerings

    (a) __Scope of exemption__ 

    Except as otherwise provided in this section, no law, rule, regulation, or order, or other administrative action of any State or any political subdivision thereof—

        (1)

         requiring, or with respect to, registration or qualification of securities, or registration or qualification of securities transactions, shall directly or indirectly apply to a security that—

            (A) is a covered security; or

            (B) will be a covered security upon completion of the transaction;

        (2)

         shall directly or indirectly prohibit, limit, or impose any conditions upon the use of—

            (A) with respect to a covered security described in subsection (b), any offering document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer; or

            (B) any proxy statement, report to shareholders, or other disclosure document relating to a covered security or the issuer thereof that is required to be and is filed with the Commission or any national securities organization registered under section 78o–3 of this title, except that this subparagraph does not apply to the laws, rules, regulations, or orders, or other administrative actions of the State of incorporation of the issuer; or

        (3) shall directly or indirectly prohibit, limit, or impose conditions, based on the merits of such offering or issuer, upon the offer or sale of any security described in paragraph (1).

    (b) __Covered securities__ 

    For purposes of this section, the following are covered securities:

        (1) __Exclusive Federal registration of nationally traded securities__ 

        A security is a covered security if such security is—

            (A) listed, or authorized for listing, on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or listed, or authorized for listing, on the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor to such entities);

            (B) listed, or authorized for listing, on a national securities exchange (or tier or segment thereof) that has listing standards that the Commission determines by rule (on its own initiative or on the basis of a petition) are substantially similar to the listing standards applicable to securities described in subparagraph (A); or

            (C) a security of the same issuer that is equal in seniority or that is a senior security to a security described in subparagraph (A) or (B).

        (2) __Exclusive Federal registration of investment companies__ 

            A security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that is registered, or that has filed a registration statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–1][/us/usc/t15/s80a–1] et seq.\].

        (3) __Sales to qualified purchasers__ 

            A security is a covered security with respect to the offer or sale of the security to qualified purchasers, as defined by the Commission by rule. In prescribing such rule, the Commission may define the term “qualified purchaser” differently with respect to different categories of securities, consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.

        (4) __Exemption in connection with certain exempt offerings__ 

        A security is a covered security with respect to a transaction that is exempt from registration under this subchapter pursuant to—

            (A) paragraph (1) or (3) of section 77d  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, and the issuer of such security files reports with the Commission pursuant to section 78m or 78o(d) of this title;

            (D)

             a rule or regulation adopted pursuant to [section 77c(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77c/b/2] and such security is—

                (i) offered or sold on a national securities exchange; or

                (ii) offered or sold to a qualified purchaser, as defined by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (3) with respect to that purchase or sale;

            (E) [section 77c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77c/a], other than the offer or sale of a security that is exempt from such registration pursuant to paragraph (4), (10), or (11) of such section, except that a municipal security that is exempt from such registration pursuant to paragraph (2) of such section is not a covered security with respect to the offer or sale of such security in the State in which the issuer of such security is located;

            (F) Commission rules or regulations issued under section 77d(2) 1 of this title, except that this subparagraph does not prohibit a State from imposing notice filing requirements that are substantially similar to those required by rule or regulation under section 77d(2) 1 of this title that are in effect on September 1, 1996; or

            (G) [section 77d(a)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77d/a/7].

The words “in connection with securities or securities transactions” probably should be part of subpar. (A). </sup></sup> 

            (A)

             with respect to—

                (i) fraud or deceit; or

                (ii) unlawful conduct by a broker, dealer, or funding portal; and

                (ii) unlawful conduct by a broker, dealer, funding portal, or issuer.

        (2) __Preservation of filing requirements__ 

            (A) __Notice filings permitted__ 

                Nothing in this section prohibits the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State from requiring the filing of any document filed with the Commission pursuant to this subchapter, together with annual or periodic reports of the value of securities sold or offered to be sold to persons located in the State (if such sales data is not included in documents filed with the Commission), solely for notice purposes and the assessment of any fee, together with a consent to service of process and any required fee.

            (B) __Preservation of fees__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Until otherwise provided by law, rule, regulation, or order, or other administrative action of any State or any political subdivision thereof, adopted after October 11, 1996, filing or registration fees with respect to securities or securities transactions shall continue to be collected in amounts determined pursuant to State law as in effect on the day before October 11, 1996.

                (ii) __Schedule__ 

                    The fees required by this subparagraph shall be paid, and all necessary supporting data on sales or offers for sales required under subparagraph (A), shall be reported on the same schedule as would have been applicable had the issuer not relied on the exemption provided in subsection (a).

            (C) __Availability of preemption contingent on payment of fees__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    During the period beginning on October 11, 1996, and ending 3 years after October 11, 1996, the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State may require the registration of securities issued by any issuer who refuses to pay the fees required by subparagraph (B).

                (ii) __Delays__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, delays in payment of fees or underpayments of fees that are promptly remedied shall not constitute a refusal to pay fees.

            (D) __Fees not permitted on listed securities__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), no filing or fee may be required with respect to any security that is a covered security pursuant to subsection (b)(1), or will be such a covered security upon completion of the transaction, or is a security of the same issuer that is equal in seniority or that is a senior security to a security that is a covered security pursuant to subsection (b)(1).

            (F)  __ <sup>\[__  __4__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __4__  __ So in original. No subpar. (E) has been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Fees not permitted on crowdfunded securities__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), no filing or fee may be required with respect to any security that is a covered security pursuant to subsection (b)(4)(B), or will be such a covered security upon completion of the transaction, except for the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of the State of the principal place of business of the issuer, or any State in which purchasers of 50 percent or greater of the aggregate amount of the issue are residents, provided that for purposes of this subparagraph, the term “State” includes the District of Columbia and the territories of the United States.

        (3) __Enforcement of requirements__ 

            Nothing in this section shall prohibit the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State from suspending the offer or sale of securities within such State as a result of the failure to submit any filing or fee required under law and permitted under this section.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

        (1) __Offering document__ 

        The term “offering document”—

            (A) has the meaning given the term “prospectus” in [section 77b(a)(10) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77b/a/10], but without regard to the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of that section; and

            (B) includes a communication that is not deemed to offer a security pursuant to a rule of the Commission.

        (2) __Prepared by or on behalf of the issuer__ 

            Not later than 6 months after October 11, 1996, the Commission shall, by rule, define the term “prepared by or on behalf of the issuer” for purposes of this section.

            The term “State” has the same meaning as in [section 78c of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c].

        (4) __Senior security__ 

            The term “senior security” means any bond, debenture, note, or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness, and any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.
