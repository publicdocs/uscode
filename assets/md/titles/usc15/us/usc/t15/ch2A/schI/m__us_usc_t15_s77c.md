The Commission, by rules and regulations or order, shall exempt from the provisions of [section 77e of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77e] any interest or participation issued in connection with a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan which covers employees some or all of whom are employees within the meaning of [section 401(c)(1) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s401/c/1], if and to the extent that the Commission determines this to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this subchapter. For purposes of this paragraph, a security issued or guaranteed by a bank shall not include any interest or participation in any collective trust fund maintained by a bank; and the term “bank” means any national bank, or banking institution organized under the laws of any State, territory, or the District of Columbia, the business of which is substantially confined to banking and is supervised by the State or territorial banking commission or similar official; except that in the case of a common trust fund or similar fund, or a collective trust fund, the term “bank” has the same meaning as in the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–1][/us/usc/t15/s80a–1] et seq.\];

        (3) Any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions, and which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited;

        (4) Any security issued by a person organized and operated exclusively for religious, educational, benevolent, fraternal, charitable, or reformatory purposes and not for pecuniary profit, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any person, private stockholder, or individual, or any security of a fund that is excluded from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(10)(B) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–3(c)(10)(B)][/us/usc/t15/s80a–3/c/10/B]\];

        (5) Any security issued (A) by a savings and loan association, building and loan association, cooperative bank, homestead association, or similar institution, which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over any such institution; or (B) by (i) a farmer’s cooperative organization exempt from tax under [section 521 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s521], (ii) a corporation described in [section 501(c)(16) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/c/16] and exempt from tax under [section 501(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/a], or (iii) a corporation described in [section 501(c)(2) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/c/2] which is exempt from tax under [section 501(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s501/a] and is organized for the exclusive purpose of holding title to property, collecting income therefrom, and turning over the entire amount thereof, less expenses, to an organization or corporation described in clause (i) or (ii);

        (6) Any interest in a railroad equipment trust.

        (7) Certificates issued by a receiver or by a trustee or debtor in possession in a case under title 11, with the approval of the court;

        (8) Any insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract or optional annuity contract, issued by a corporation subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions, of any State or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia;

        (9) Except with respect to a security exchanged in a case under title 11, any security exchanged by the issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange;

        (10) Except with respect to a security exchanged in a case under title 11, any security which is issued in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved, after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all persons to whom it is proposed to issue securities in such exchange shall have the right to appear, by any court, or by any official or agency of the United States, or by any State or Territorial banking or insurance commission or other governmental authority expressly authorized by law to grant such approval;

        (11) Any security which is a part of an issue offered and sold only to persons resident within a single State or Territory, where the issuer of such security is a person resident and doing business within or, if a corporation, incorporated by and doing business within, such State or Territory.

        (12)

         Any equity security issued in connection with the acquisition by a holding company of a bank under [section 1842(a) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1842/a] or a savings association under [section 1467a(e) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1467a/e], if—

            (A) the acquisition occurs solely as part of a reorganization in which security holders exchange their shares of a bank or savings association for shares of a newly formed holding company with no significant assets other than securities of the bank or savings association and the existing subsidiaries of the bank or savings association;

            (B) the security holders receive, after that reorganization, substantially the same proportional share interests in the holding company as they held in the bank or savings association, except for nominal changes in shareholders’ interests resulting from lawful elimination of fractional interests and the exercise of dissenting shareholders’ rights under State or Federal law;

            (C) the rights and interests of security holders in the holding company are substantially the same as those in the bank or savings association prior to the transaction, other than as may be required by law; and

            (D) the holding company has substantially the same assets and liabilities, on a consolidated basis, as the bank or savings association had prior to the transaction.

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “savings association” means a savings association (as defined in [section 1813(b) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1813/b]) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

        (13) Any security issued by or any interest or participation in any church plan, company or account that is excluded from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(14) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–3(c)(14)][/us/usc/t15/s80a–3/c/14]\].

                (ii) disqualification provisions under which the exemption shall not be available to the issuer or its predecessors, affiliates, officers, directors, underwriters, or other related persons, which shall be substantially similar to the disqualification provisions contained in the regulations adopted in accordance with section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ([15 U.S.C. 77d][/us/usc/t15/s77d] note).
