## § 77b–1. Swap agreements

    (a) __\[Reserved\]__ 

    (b) __Security-based swap agreements__ 

        (1) The definition of “security” in [section 77b(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77b/a/1] does not include any security-based swap agreement (as defined in [section 78c(a)(78) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/78]).

        (2) The Commission is prohibited from registering, or requiring, recommending, or suggesting, the registration under this subchapter of any security-based swap agreement (as defined in [section 78c(a)(78) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/78]). If the Commission becomes aware that a registrant has filed a registration statement with respect to such a swap agreement, the Commission shall promptly so notify the registrant. Any such registration statement with respect to such a swap agreement shall be void and of no force or effect.

        (3)

         The Commission is prohibited from—

            (A) promulgating, interpreting, or enforcing rules; or

            (B) issuing orders of general applicability;

            under this subchapter in a manner that imposes or specifies reporting or recordkeeping requirements, procedures, or standards as prophylactic measures against fraud, manipulation, or insider trading with respect to any security-based swap agreement (as defined in [section 78c(a)(78) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/78]).

        (4) References in this subchapter to the “purchase” or “sale” of a security-based swap agreement shall be deemed to mean the execution, termination (prior to its scheduled maturity date), assignment, exchange, or similar transfer or conveyance of, or extinguishing of rights or obligations under, a security-based swap agreement (as defined in [section 78c(a)(78) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c/a/78]), as the context may require.
