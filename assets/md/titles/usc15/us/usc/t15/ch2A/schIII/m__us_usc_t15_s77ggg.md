An application may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the effective date thereof. Subject to the provisions of [section 77uuu of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77uuu], the information and documents contained in or filed with any application shall be made available to the public under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, and copies thereof, photostatic or otherwise, shall be furnished to every applicant therefor at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.
