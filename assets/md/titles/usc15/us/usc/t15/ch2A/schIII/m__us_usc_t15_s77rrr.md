## § 77rrr. Effect of prescribed indenture provisions

    (a) __Imposed duties to control__ 

        If any provision of the indenture to be qualified limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of subsection (c) of this section, the imposed duties shall control.

    (b) __Additional provisions__ 

        The indenture to be qualified may contain, in addition to provisions specifically authorized under this subchapter to be included therein, any other provisions the inclusion of which is not in contravention of any provision of this subchapter.

    (c) __Provisions governing qualified indentures__ 

        The provisions of sections 77jjj to and including 77qqq of this title that impose duties on any person (including provisions automatically deemed included in an indenture unless the indenture provides that such provisions are excluded) are a part of and govern every qualified indenture, whether or not physically contained therein, shall be deemed retroactively to govern each indenture heretofore qualified, and prospectively to govern each indenture hereafter qualified under this subchapter and shall be deemed retroactively to amend and supersede inconsistent provisions in each such indenture heretofore qualified. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed to effect the inclusion (by retroactive amendment or otherwise) in the text of any indenture heretofore qualified of any of the optional provisions contemplated by section 77jjj(b)(1), 77kkk(b), 77nnn(d), 77ooo(a), 77ooo(b), 77ooo(d), 77ooo(e), or 77ppp(a)(1) of this title.
