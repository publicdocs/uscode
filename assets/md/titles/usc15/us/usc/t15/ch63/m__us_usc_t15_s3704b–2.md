Such information shall include technical reports and information, computer software, application assessments generated pursuant to [section 3710(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s3710/c], and information regarding training technology and other federally owned or originated technologies. The Secretary shall issue regulations within one year after February 14, 1992, outlining procedures for the ongoing transfer of such information to the National Technical Information Service.
