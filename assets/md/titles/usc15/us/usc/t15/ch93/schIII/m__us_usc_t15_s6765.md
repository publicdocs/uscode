## § 6765. Judicial review

    (a) __Jurisdiction__ 

        The appropriate United States district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over litigation involving the Association, including disputes between the Association and its members that arise under this subchapter. Suits brought in State court involving the Association shall be deemed to have arisen under Federal law and therefore be subject to jurisdiction in the appropriate United States district court.

    (b) __Exhaustion of remedies__ 

        An aggrieved person shall be required to exhaust all available administrative remedies before the Association and the NAIC before it may seek judicial review of an Association decision.

    (c) __Standards of review__ 

        The standards set forth in [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] shall be applied whenever a rule or bylaw of the Association is under judicial review, and the standards set forth in [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554] shall be applied whenever a disciplinary action of the Association is judicially reviewed.
