        (4) __Criminal history record check required__ 

            (A) __In general__

                An insurance producer who is licensed in a State and who has undergone a criminal history record check during the 2-year period preceding the date of submission of an application to become a member of the Association, in compliance with a requirement to undergo such criminal history record check as a condition for such licensure in the State, shall be deemed to have undergone a criminal history record check for purposes of subparagraph (A).

            (J) __Rule of construction__

            (K) __Regulations__ 

            The Attorney General shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph, which shall include—

            (B) be the equivalent of a nonresident insurance producer license for purposes of authorizing the insurance producer to engage in the activities described in subparagraph (A) in any State where the member pays the licensing fee; and

            (C) be the equivalent of a nonresident insurance producer license for the purpose of subjecting an insurance producer to all laws, regulations, provisions or other action of any State concerning revocation, suspension, or other enforcement action related to the ability of a member to engage in any activity within the scope of authority granted under this subsection and to all State laws, regulations, provisions, and actions preserved under paragraph (5).

        (2) __Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994__

        (5) __Preservation of consumer protection and market conduct regulation__ 

            (A) __In general__
