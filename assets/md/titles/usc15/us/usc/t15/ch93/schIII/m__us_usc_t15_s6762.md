        (1) at least a majority of the States representing at least 50 percent of the total United States commercial-lines insurance premiums have not satisfied the uniformity or reciprocity requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of [section 6751 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6751]; and

        (2) the NAIC has not approved the Association’s bylaws as required by [section 6758 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6758] or is unable to operate or supervise the Association, or the Association is not conducting its activities as required under this Act.

    (b) __Board appointments__

        (2) __Procedures for obtaining NAIC appointment recommendations__ 

            (A) __Initial determination and recommendations__ 

                After the date on which the provisions of subsection (a) of this section take effect, the NAIC shall, not later than 60 days thereafter, provide a list of recommended candidates to the President. If the NAIC fails to provide a list by that date, or if any list that is provided does not include at least 14 recommended candidates or comply with the requirements of [section 6756(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6756/c], the President shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, make the requisite appointments without considering the views of the NAIC.

                (ii) __Suspension of rules or actions__ 

                    The President, or a person designated by the President for such purpose, may suspend the effectiveness of any rule, or prohibit any action, of the Association which the President or the designee determines is contrary to the public interest.

    (c) __Annual report__ 

        As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Association shall submit to the President and to the Congress a written report relative to the conduct of its business, and the exercise of the other rights and powers granted by this subchapter, during such fiscal year. Such report shall include financial statements setting forth the financial position of the Association at the end of such fiscal year and the results of its operations (including the source and application of its funds) for such fiscal year.
