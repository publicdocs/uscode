## § 6755. Membership

    (a) __Eligibility__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any State-licensed insurance producer shall be eligible to become a member in the Association.

        (2) __Ineligibility for suspension or revocation of license__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State-licensed insurance producer shall not be eligible to become a member if a State insurance regulator has suspended or revoked such producer’s license in that State during the 3-year period preceding the date on which such producer applies for membership.

        (3) __Resumption of eligibility__ 

        Paragraph (2) shall cease to apply to any insurance producer if—

            (A) the State insurance regulator renews the license of such producer in the State in which the license was suspended or revoked; or

            (B) the suspension or revocation is subsequently overturned.

    (b) __Authority to establish membership criteria__ 

    The Association shall have the authority to establish membership criteria that—

        (1) bear a reasonable relationship to the purposes for which the Association was established; and

        (2) do not unfairly limit the access of smaller agencies to the Association membership.

    (c) __Establishment of classes and categories__ 

        (1) __Classes of membership__ 

            The Association may establish separate classes of membership, with separate criteria, if the Association reasonably determines that performance of different duties requires different levels of education, training, or experience.

        (2) __Categories__ 

            The Association may establish separate categories of membership for individuals and for other persons. The establishment of any such categories of membership shall be based either on the types of licensing categories that exist under State laws or on the aggregate amount of business handled by an insurance producer. No special categories of membership, and no distinct membership criteria, shall be established for members which are depository institutions or for their employees, agents, or affiliates.

    (d) __Membership criteria__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Association may establish criteria for membership which shall include standards for integrity, personal qualifications, education, training, and experience.

        (2) __Minimum standard__ 

            In establishing criteria under paragraph (1), the Association shall consider the highest levels of insurance producer qualifications established under the licensing laws of the States.

    (e) __Effect of membership__ 

        Membership in the Association shall entitle the member to licensure in each State for which the member pays the requisite fees, including licensing fees and, where applicable, bonding requirements, set by such State.

    (f) __Annual renewal__ 

        Membership in the Association shall be renewed on an annual basis.

    (g) __Continuing education__ 

        The Association shall establish, as a condition of membership, continuing education requirements which shall be comparable to or greater than the continuing education requirements under the licensing laws of a majority of the States.

    (h) __Suspension and revocation__ 

    The Association may—

        (1) inspect and examine the records and offices of the members of the Association to determine compliance with the criteria for membership established by the Association; and

        (2)

         suspend or revoke the membership of an insurance producer if—

            (A) the producer fails to meet the applicable membership criteria of the Association; or

            (B) the producer has been subject to disciplinary action pursuant to a final adjudicatory proceeding under the jurisdiction of a State insurance regulator, and the Association concludes that retention of membership in the Association would not be in the public interest.

    (i) __Office of consumer complaints__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Association shall establish an office of consumer complaints that shall—

            (A) receive and investigate complaints from both consumers and State insurance regulators related to members of the Association; and

            (B) recommend to the Association any disciplinary actions that the office considers appropriate, to the extent that any such recommendation is not inconsistent with State law.

        (2) __Records and referrals__ 

        The office of consumer complaints of the Association shall—

            (A) maintain records of all complaints received in accordance with paragraph (1) and make such records available to the NAIC and to each State insurance regulator for the State of residence of the consumer who filed the complaint; and

            (B) refer, when appropriate, any such complaint to any appropriate State insurance regulator.

        (3) __Telephone and other access__ 

            The office of consumer complaints shall maintain a toll-free telephone number for the purpose of this subsection and, as practicable, other alternative means of communication with consumers, such as an Internet home page.
