## § 3001. Congressional findings and policy

    (a)

     The Congress finds that—

        (1) the States should have the primary responsibility for determining what forms of gambling may legally take place within their borders;

        (2) the Federal Government should prevent interference by one State with the gambling policies of another, and should act to protect identifiable national interests; and

        (3) in the limited area of interstate off-track wagering on horseraces, there is a need for Federal action to ensure States will continue to cooperate with one another in the acceptance of legal interstate wagers.

    (b) It is the policy of the Congress in this chapter to regulate interstate commerce with respect to wagering on horseracing, in order to further the horseracing and legal off-track betting industries in the United States.
