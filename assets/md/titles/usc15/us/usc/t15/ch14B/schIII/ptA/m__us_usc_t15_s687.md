## § 687. Operation and regulation of companies

    (a) __Cooperation with banks and other financial institutions__ 

        Wherever practicable the operations of a small business investment company, including the generation of business, may be undertaken in cooperation with banks or other investors or lenders, incorporated or unincorporated, and any servicing or initial investigation required for loans or acquisitions of securities by the company under the provisions of this chapter may be handled through such banks or other investors or lenders on a fee basis. Any small business investment company may receive fees for services rendered to such banks and other investors and lenders.

    (b) __Use of advisory services; depository or fiscal agents; investment of funds__ 

    Each small business investment company may make use, wherever practicable, of the advisory services of the Federal Reserve System and of the Department of Commerce which are available for and useful to industrial and commercial businesses, and may provide consulting and advisory services on a fee basis and have on its staff persons competent to provide such services. Any Federal Reserve bank is authorized to act as a depository or fiscal agent for any company operating under provisions of this chapter. Any such company that is licensed before October 1, 2004 and has outstanding financings is authorized to invest funds not needed for its operations—

        (1) in direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States;

        (2) in certificates of deposit or other accounts of federally insured banks or other federally insured depository institutions, if the certificates or other accounts mature or are otherwise fully available not more than 1 year after the date of the investment; or

        (3) in mutual funds, securities, or other instruments that consist of, or represent pooled assets of, investments described in paragraphs (1) or (2).

    (c) __Rules and regulations__ 

        The Administration is authorized to prescribe regulations governing the operations of small business investment companies, and to carry out the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.

    (d) __Forfeiture of rights, privileges, and franchises; jurisdiction__ 

        Should any small business investment company violate or fail to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or of regulations prescribed hereunder, all of its rights, privileges, and franchises derived therefrom may thereby be forfeited. Before any such company shall be declared dissolved, or its rights, privileges, and franchises forfeited, any noncompliance with or violation of this chapter shall be determined and adjudged by a court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in a suit brought for that purpose in the district, territory, or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in which the principal office of such company is located. Any such suit shall be brought by the United States at the instance of the Administration or the Attorney General.

    (e) __Liability of United States__ 

        Except as expressly provided otherwise in this chapter, nothing in this chapter or in any other provision of law shall be deemed to impose any liability on the United States with respect to any obligation entered into, or stocks issued, or commitments made, by any company operating under the provisions of this chapter.

    (f) __Performance of functions, powers, and duties by Administration and Administrator__

            Prior to providing financial assistance to a small business concern under this chapter, a company licensed pursuant to [section 681 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s681] shall certify in writing that it has reviewed the application for assistance of the small business concern and that all documentation and other information supports the eligibility of the applicant.

        (3) __Retention of certifications__ 

            Certificates made pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be retained by the company licensed pursuant to [section 681 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s681] for the duration of the financial assistance.

    (i) __Interest rates__ 

        (1) The purpose of this subsection is to facilitate the orderly and necessary flow of long-term loans and equity funds from small business investment companies to small business concerns.

        (2) In the case of a business loan, the small business investment company making such loan may charge interest on such loan at a rate which does not exceed the maximum rate prescribed by regulation by the Administration for loans made by any licensee (determined without regard to any State rate incorporated by such regulation). In this paragraph, the term “interest” includes only the maximum mandatory sum, expressed in dollars or as a percentage rate, that is payable with respect to the business loan amount received by the small business concern, and does not include the value, if any, of contingent obligations, including warrants, royalty, or conversion rights, granting the small business investment company an ownership interest in the equity or increased future revenue of the small business concern receiving the business loan.

        (3) A State law or constitutional provision shall be preempted for purposes of paragraph (2) with respect to any loan if such loan is made before the date, on or after April 1, 1980, on which such State adopts a law or certifies that the voters of such State have voted in favor of any provision, constitutional or otherwise, which states explicitly and by its terms that such State does not want the provisions of this subsection to apply with respect to loans made in such State, except that such State law or constitutional or other provision shall be preempted in the case of a loan made, on or after the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made, pursuant to a commitment to make such loan which was entered into on or after April 1, 1980, and prior to the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made.

        (4)

            (A) If the maximum rate of interest authorized under paragraph (2) on any loan made by a small business investment company exceeds the rate which would be authorized by applicable State law if such State law were not preempted for purposes of this subsection, the charging of interest at any rate in excess of the rate authorized by paragraph (2) shall be deemed a forfeiture of the greater of (i) all interest which the loan carries with it, or (ii) all interest which has been agreed to be paid thereon.

            (B) In the case of any loan with respect to which there is a forfeiture of interest under subparagraph (A), the person who paid the interest may recover from a small business investment company making such loan an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid on such loan. Such interest may be recovered in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the most recent payment of interest.
