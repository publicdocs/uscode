## § 694b. Surety bond guarantees

    (a) __Authority of Administration to guarantee surety against loss from principal’s breach of bond__ 

        (1)

            (A) The Administration may, upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, guarantee and enter into commitments to guarantee any surety against loss resulting from a breach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, performance bond, or bonds ancillary thereto, by a principal on any total work order or contract amount at the time of bond execution that does not exceed $6,500,000, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with [section 1908 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s1908].

            (B) The Administrator may guarantee a surety under subparagraph (A) for a total work order or contract amount that does not exceed $10,000,000, if a contracting officer of a Federal agency certifies that such a guarantee is necessary.

        (2) The terms and conditions of said guarantees and commitments may vary from surety to surety on the basis of the Administration’s experience with the particular surety.

        (3) The Administration may authorize any surety, without further administration approval, to issue, monitor, and service such bonds subject to the Administration’s guarantee.

        (4)

         No such guarantee may be issued, unless—

            (A) the person who would be principal under the bond is a small business concern;

            (B) the bond is required in order for such person to bid on a contract, or to serve as a prime contractor or subcontractor thereon;

            (C) such person is not able to obtain such bond on reasonable terms and conditions without a guarantee under this section; and

            (D) there is a reasonable expectation that such principal will perform the covenants and conditions of the contract with respect to which such bond is required, and the terms and conditions of such bond are reasonable in the light of the risks involved and the extent of the surety’s participation.

        (5)

            (A) The Administration shall promptly act upon an application from a surety to participate in the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program, authorized by paragraph (3), in accordance with criteria and procedures established in regulations pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

            (B) The Administration is authorized to reduce the allotment of bond guarantee authority or terminate the participation of a surety in the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program based on the rate of participation of such surety during the 4 most recent fiscal year quarters compared to the median rate of participation by the other sureties in the program.

    (b) __Indemnification of surety against loss from avoiding breach__ 

    Subject to the provisions of this section, in connection with the issuance by the Administration of a guarantee to a surety as provided by subsection (a) of this section, the Administration may agree to indemnify such surety against a loss sustained by such surety in avoiding or attempting to avoid a breach of the terms of a bond guaranteed by the Administration pursuant to subsection (a) of this section: Provided, however—

        (1) prior to making any payment under this subsection, the Administration shall first determine that a breach of the terms of such bond was imminent;

        (3) no payment by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall exceed 10 per centum of the contract price unless the Administrator determines that a greater payment should be made as a result of a finding by the Administrator that the surety’s loss sustained in avoiding or attempting to avoid such breach was necessary and reasonable.

        In no event shall the Administration pay a surety pursuant to this subsection an amount exceeding the guaranteed share of the bond available to such surety pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Limitation of liability__ 

    Any guarantee or agreement to indemnify under this section shall obligate the Administration to pay to the surety a sum—

        (1) not to exceed 70 per centum of the loss incurred and paid by a surety authorized to issue bonds subject to the Administration’s guarantee under subsection (a)(3) of this section;

        (2) not to exceed 90 per centum of the loss incurred and paid in the case of a surety requiring the Administration’s specific approval for the issuance of such bond, but in no event may the Administration make any duplicate payment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or any other subsection;

        (3)

         equal to 90 per centum of the loss incurred and paid in the case of a surety requiring the administration’s  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be capitalized. </sup></sup>  specific approval for the issuance of a bond, if—

            (A) the total amount of the contract at the time of execution of the bond or bonds is $100,000 or less, or

        (4) determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if applicable.

    (d) __Regulations__ 

        The Administration may establish and periodically review regulations for participating sureties which shall require such sureties to meet Administration standards for underwriting, claim practices, and loss ratios.

    (e) __Reimbursement of surety; conditions__ 

    Pursuant to any such guarantee or agreement, the Administration shall reimburse the surety, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, except that the Administration shall be relieved of liability (in whole or in part within the discretion of the Administration) if—

        (1) the surety obtained such guarantee or agreement, or applied for such reimbursement, by fraud or material misrepresentation,

        (2) the total contract amount at the time of execution of the bond or bonds exceeds $6,500,000,

        (3) the surety has breached a material term or condition of such guarantee agreement, or

        (4) the surety has substantially violated the regulations promulgated by the Administration pursuant to subsection (d).

    (f) __Procedure for reimbursement__ 

        The Administration may, upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, adopt a procedure for reimbursing a surety for its paid losses billed each month, based upon prior monthly payments to such surety, with subsequent adjustments after such disbursement.

    (g) __Audit__ 

        (1) Each participating surety shall make reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require.

        (2) The Administration may at all reasonable times audit, in the offices of a participating surety, all documents, files, books, records, and other material relevant to the Administration’s guarantee, commitments to guarantee, or agreements to indemnify any surety pursuant to this section.

        (3) Each surety participating under the authority of paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section shall be audited at least once every three years by examiners selected and approved by the Administration.

    (h) __Administrative provisions__

    (i) __Powers of Administration respecting loans__ 

        The provisions of [section 693 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s693] shall apply in the administration of this section.
