## § 5542. Department of Energy high-end computing research and development program

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary shall—

        (1) carry out a program of research and development (including development of software and hardware) to advance high-end computing systems; and

        (2) develop and deploy high-end computing systems for advanced scientific and engineering applications.

    (b) __Program__ 

    The program shall—

        (1) support both individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams of investigators;

        (2) conduct research in multiple architectures, which may include vector, reconfigurable logic, streaming, processor-in-memory, and multithreading architectures;

        (3) conduct research on software for high-end computing systems, including research on algorithms, programming environments, tools, languages, and operating systems for high-end computing systems, in collaboration with architecture development efforts;

        (4) provide for sustained access by the research community in the United States to high-end computing systems and to Leadership Systems, including provision of technical support for users of such systems;

        (5) support technology transfer to the private sector and others in accordance with applicable law; and

        (6) ensure that the high-end computing activities of the Department of Energy are coordinated with relevant activities in industry and with other Federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the National Security Agency, the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
