        (A) expand the number of researchers, educators, and students with training in high-performance computing and access to high-performance computing resources;

        (B) promote the further development of an information infrastructure of data bases, services, access mechanisms, and research facilities available for use through the Internet;

        (C) stimulate research on software technology;

        (D) promote the more rapid development and wider distribution of computing software tools and applications software;

        (E) accelerate the development of computing systems and subsystems;

        (F) provide for the application of high-performance computing to Grand Challenges;

        (G) invest in basic research and education, and promote the inclusion of high-performance computing into educational institutions at all levels; and

        (H) promote greater collaboration among government, Federal laboratories, industry, high-performance computing centers, and universities;

    (2) improving the interagency planning and coordination of Federal research and development on high-performance computing and maximizing the effectiveness of the Federal Government’s high-performance computing network research and development programs;
