## § 717u. Jurisdiction of offenses; enforcement of liabilities and duties

    The District Courts of the United States and the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules, regulations, and orders thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by, or to enjoin any violation of, this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder. Any criminal proceeding shall be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by, or to enjoin any violation of, this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder may be brought in any such district or in the district wherein the defendant is an inhabitant, and process in such cases may be served wherever the defendant may be found. Judgments and decrees so rendered shall be subject to review as provided in sections 1254, 1291, and 1292 of title 28. No costs shall be assessed against the Commission in any judicial proceeding by or against the Commission under this chapter.

([June 21, 1938, ch. 556, § 24][/us/act/1938-06-21/ch556/s24], formerly § 22, [52 Stat. 833][/us/stat/52/833]; [June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 1][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646/s1], [62 Stat. 875][/us/stat/62/875], 895; renumbered § 24, [Pub.

 __Codification__ 

    The words “the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia” following “The District Courts of the United States” omitted as superfluous in view of [section 132(a) of Title 28][/us/usc/t28/s132/a], Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that “There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district” and [section 88 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s88] which states that “The District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district”.

    “Sections 1254, 1291, and 1292 of title 28” substituted in text for “sections 128 and 240 of the Judicial Code, as amended \[[28 U.S.C. 225][/us/usc/t28/s225] and 347\]” on authority of [act June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 869][/us/stat/62/869], the first section of which enacted Title 28.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 24 of act June 21, 1938, was renumbered section 26 and is classified to [section 717w of this title][/us/usc/t15/s717w].
