## § 717q. Appointment of officers and employees

    The Commission is authorized to appoint and fix the compensation of such officers, attorneys, examiners, and experts as may be necessary for carrying out its functions under this chapter; and the Commission may, subject to civil-service laws, appoint such other officers and employees as are necessary for carrying out such functions and fix their salaries in accordance with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5.

([June 21, 1938, ch. 556, § 18][/us/act/1938-06-21/ch556/s18], [52 Stat. 831][/us/stat/52/831]; [Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch782], title XI, § 1106(a), [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972].)

 __Codification__ 

    Provisions that authorized the Commission to appoint and fix the compensation of such officers, attorneys, examiners, and experts as may be necessary for carrying out its functions under this chapter “without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to the employment and compensation of officers and employees of the United States” are omitted as obsolete and superseded.

    As to the compensation of such personnel, sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

    Such appointments are now subject to the civil service laws unless specifically excepted by those laws or by laws enacted subsequent to Executive Order 8743, Apr. 23, 1941, issued by the President pursuant to the [Act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919][/us/act/1940-11-26/ch919], title I, § 1, [54 Stat. 1211][/us/stat/54/1211], which covered most excepted positions into the classified (competitive) civil service. The Order is set out as a note under [section 3301 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3301].

    “Chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” substituted in text for “the Classification Act of 1949, as amended” on authority of [Pub. L. 89–554, § 7(b)][/us/pl/89/554/s7/b], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 631][/us/stat/80/631], the first section of which enacted Title 5.

 __Amendments__ 

    1949—Act Oct. 28, 1949, substituted “Classification Act of 1949” for “Classification Act of 1923”.

 __Repeals__ 

    [Act Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch782], cited as a credit to this section, was repealed (subject to a savings clause) by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8, [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], 655.
