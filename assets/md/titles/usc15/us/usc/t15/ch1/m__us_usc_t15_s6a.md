## § 6a. Conduct involving trade or commerce with foreign nations

Sections 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless—

    (1)

     such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect—

        (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations; or

        (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States; and

    (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section.

        If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then sections 1 to 7 of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States.
