## § 7004. Applicability to Federal and State governments

    (a) __Filing and access requirements__ 

        Subject to subsection (c)(2), nothing in this subchapter limits or supersedes any requirement by a Federal regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization, or State regulatory agency that records be filed with such agency or organization in accordance with specified standards or formats.

    (b) __Preservation of existing rulemaking authority__ 

        (1) __Use of authority to interpret__ 

        Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (c), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency that is responsible for rulemaking under any other statute may interpret [section 7001 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001] with respect to such statute through—

            (A) the issuance of regulations pursuant to a statute; or

            (B) to the extent such agency is authorized by statute to issue orders or guidance, the issuance of orders or guidance of general applicability that are publicly available and published (in the Federal Register in the case of an order or guidance issued by a Federal regulatory agency).

            This paragraph does not grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to issue regulations, orders, or guidance pursuant to any statute that does not authorize such issuance.

        (2) __Limitations on interpretation authority__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a Federal regulatory agency shall not adopt any regulation, order, or guidance described in paragraph (1), and a State regulatory agency is preempted by [section 7001 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001] from adopting any regulation, order, or guidance described in paragraph (1), unless—

            (A) such regulation, order, or guidance is consistent with [section 7001 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001];

            (B) such regulation, order, or guidance does not add to the requirements of such section; and

            (C)

             such agency finds, in connection with the issuance of such regulation, order, or guidance, that—

                (i) there is a substantial justification for the regulation, order, or guidance;

                (ii)

                 the methods selected to carry out that purpose—

                    (I) are substantially equivalent to the requirements imposed on records that are not electronic records; and

                    (II) will not impose unreasonable costs on the acceptance and use of electronic records; and

                (iii) the methods selected to carry out that purpose do not require, or accord greater legal status or effect to, the implementation or application of a specific technology or technical specification for performing the functions of creating, storing, generating, receiving, communicating, or authenticating electronic records or electronic signatures.

        (3) __Performance standards__ 

            (A) __Accuracy, record integrity, accessibility__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(C)(iii), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency may interpret [section 7001(d) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001/d] to specify performance standards to assure accuracy, record integrity, and accessibility of records that are required to be retained. Such performance standards may be specified in a manner that imposes a requirement in violation of paragraph (2)(C)(iii) if the requirement (i) serves an important governmental objective; and (ii) is substantially related to the achievement of that objective. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to require use of a particular type of software or hardware in order to comply with [section 7001(d) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001/d].

            (B) __Paper or printed form__ 

            Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1), a Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency may interpret [section 7001(d) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001/d] to require retention of a record in a tangible printed or paper form if—

                (i) there is a compelling governmental interest relating to law enforcement or national security for imposing such requirement; and

                (ii) imposing such requirement is essential to attaining such interest.

        (4) __Exceptions for actions by government as market participant__ 

            Paragraph (2)(C)(iii) shall not apply to the statutes, regulations, or other rules of law governing procurement by the Federal or any State government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

    (c) __Additional limitations__ 

        (1) __Reimposing paper prohibited__ 

            Nothing in subsection (b) (other than paragraph (3)(B) thereof) shall be construed to grant any Federal regulatory agency or State regulatory agency authority to impose or reimpose any requirement that a record be in a tangible printed or paper form.

        (2) __Continuing obligation under Government Paperwork Elimination Act__ 

            Nothing in subsection (a) or (b) relieves any Federal regulatory agency of its obligations under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (title XVII of [Public Law 105–277][/us/pl/105/277]).

    (d) __Authority to exempt from consent provision__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A Federal regulatory agency may, with respect to matter within its jurisdiction, by regulation or order issued after notice and an opportunity for public comment, exempt without condition a specified category or type of record from the requirements relating to consent in [section 7001(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001/c] if such exemption is necessary to eliminate a substantial burden on electronic commerce and will not increase the material risk of harm to consumers.

        (2) __Prospectuses__ 

            Within 30 days after June 30, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall issue a regulation or order pursuant to paragraph (1) exempting from [section 7001(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7001/c] any records that are required to be provided in order to allow advertising, sales literature, or other information concerning a security issued by an investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–1][/us/usc/t15/s80a–1] et seq.\], or concerning the issuer thereof, to be excluded from the definition of a prospectus under [section 77b(a)(10)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s77b/a/10/A].

    (e) __Electronic letters of agency__ 

        The Federal Communications Commission shall not hold any contract for telecommunications service or letter of agency for a preferred carrier change, that otherwise complies with the Commission’s rules, to be legally ineffective, invalid, or unenforceable solely because an electronic record or electronic signature was used in its formation or authorization.
