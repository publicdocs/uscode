## § 3610. Relationship of statutory provisions to State and local laws

    Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any State or local government to enact and enforce any law, ordinance, or code with regard to any condominium, cooperative, or conversion project, if such law, ordinance, or code does not abridge, deny, or contravene any standard for consumer protection established under this chapter. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the provisions of this chapter, except for the application of [section 3608 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s3608] and the prohibition included in [section 3609 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s3609] as it relates to a lease with respect to which a cause of action may be established under [section 3608 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s3608], shall not apply in the case of any State or local government which has the authority to enact and enforce such a law, ordinance, or code, if, during the three-year period following October 8, 1980, such State or local government enacts a law, ordinance, or code, or amendments thereto, stating in substance that such provisions of this chapter shall not apply in that State or local government jurisdiction.

([Pub. L. 96–399, title VI][/us/pl/96/399/tVI], § 611, Oct. 8, 1980, [94 Stat. 1679][/us/stat/94/1679].)
