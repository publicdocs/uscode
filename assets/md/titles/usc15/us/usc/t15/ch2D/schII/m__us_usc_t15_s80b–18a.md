## § 80b–18a. State regulation of investment advisers

    (a) __Jurisdiction of State regulators__ 

        Nothing in this subchapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commissioner (or any agency or officer performing like functions) of any State over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this subchapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.

    (b) __Dual compliance purposes__ 

    No State may enforce any law or regulation that would require an investment adviser to maintain any books or records in addition to those required under the laws of the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business, if the investment adviser—

        (1) is registered or licensed as such in the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business; and

        (2) is in compliance with the applicable books and records requirements of the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business.

    (c) __Limitation on capital and bond requirements__ 

    No State may enforce any law or regulation that would require an investment adviser to maintain a higher minimum net capital or to post any bond in addition to any that is required under the laws of the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business, if the investment adviser—

        (1) is registered or licensed as such in the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business; and

        (2) is in compliance with the applicable net capital or bonding requirements of the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business.

    (d) __National de minimis standard__ 

    No law of any State or political subdivision thereof requiring the registration, licensing, or qualification as an investment adviser shall require an investment adviser to register with the securities commissioner of the State (or any agency or officer performing like functions) or to comply with such law (other than any provision thereof prohibiting fraudulent conduct) if the investment adviser—

        (1) does not have a place of business located within the State; and

        (2) during the preceding 12-month period, has had fewer than 6 clients who are residents of that State.
