            (B) is an adviser to an investment company registered under subchapter I of this chapter.

        (2) __Treatment of mid-sized investment advisers__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                No investment adviser described in subparagraph (B) shall register under [section 80b–3 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–3], unless the investment adviser is an adviser to an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–1][/us/usc/t15/s80a–1] et seq.\], or a company which has elected to be a business development company pursuant to section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–53][/us/usc/t15/s80a–53]\], and has not withdrawn the election, except that, if by effect of this paragraph an investment adviser would be required to register with 15 or more States, then the adviser may register under [section 80b–3 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–3].

            (B) __Covered persons__ 

            An investment adviser described in this subparagraph is an investment adviser that—

                (i) is required to be registered as an investment adviser with the securities commissioner (or any agency or office performing like functions) of the State in which it maintains its principal office and place of business and, if registered, would be subject to examination as an investment adviser by any such commissioner, agency, or office; and

                (ii)

                 has assets under management between—

                    (I) the amount specified under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), as such amount may have been adjusted by the Commission pursuant to that subparagraph; and

                    (II) $100,000,000, or such higher amount as the Commission may, by rule, deem appropriate in accordance with the purposes of this subchapter.

        (3) __“Assets under management” defined__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “assets under management” means the securities portfolios with respect to which an investment adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services.

    (b) __Advisers subject to Commission authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        No law of any State or political subdivision thereof requiring the registration, licensing, or qualification as an investment adviser or supervised person of an investment adviser shall apply to any person—

            (A) that is registered under [section 80b–3 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–3] as an investment adviser, or that is a supervised person of such person, except that a State may license, register, or otherwise qualify any investment adviser representative who has a place of business located within that State; or

            (B) that is not registered under [section 80b–3 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–3] because that person is excepted from the definition of an investment adviser under [section 80b–2(a)(11) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–2/a/11].

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State from investigating and bringing enforcement actions with respect to fraud or deceit against an investment adviser or person associated with an investment adviser.

    (c) __Exemptions__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Commission, by rule or regulation upon its own motion, or by order upon application, may permit the registration with the Commission of any person or class of persons to which the application of subsection (a) would be unfair, a burden on interstate commerce, or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of this section.

    (d) __State assistance__ 

        Upon request of the securities commissioner (or any agency or officer performing like functions) of any State, the Commission may provide such training, technical assistance, or other reasonable assistance in connection with the regulation of investment advisers by the State.
