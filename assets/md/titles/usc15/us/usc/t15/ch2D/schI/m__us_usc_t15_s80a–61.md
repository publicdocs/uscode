    (1) any loan to a director, officer, or employee of, or general partner in, a business development company for the purpose of purchasing securities of such company as part of an executive compensation plan, if such loan meets the requirements of [section 80a–56(j) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80a–56/j]; or

    (2) any loan to a company controlled by a business development company, which companies could be deemed to be under common control solely because a third person controls such business development company.
