    (c) __Standards for regulations__ 

        (1) __Standards__

                    (II) that is a qualified residential mortgage that is transferred, sold, or conveyed through the issuance of an asset-backed security by the securitizer, if 1 or more of the assets that collateralize the asset-backed security are not qualified residential mortgages; or

                (ii) less than 5 percent of the credit risk for an asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage that is transferred, sold, or conveyed through the issuance of an asset-backed security by the securitizer, if the originator of the asset meets the underwriting standards prescribed under paragraph (2)(B);

                (i) retention of a specified amount or percentage of the total credit risk of the asset;

                (ii) retention of the first-loss position by a third-party purchaser that specifically negotiates for the purchase of such first loss position, holds adequate financial resources to back losses, provides due diligence on all individual assets in the pool before the issuance of the asset-backed securities, and meets the same standards for risk retention as the Federal banking agencies and the Commission require of the securitizer;

                (iii) a total or partial exemption for any asset-backed security that is a security issued or guaranteed by any State of the United States, or by any political subdivision of a State or territory, or by any public instrumentality of a State or territory that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 \[[15 U.S.C. 77a][/us/usc/t15/s77a] et seq.\] by reason of section 3(a)(2) of that Act ([15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)][/us/usc/t15/s77c/a/2]), or a security defined as a qualified scholarship funding bond in [section 150(d)(2) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s150/d/2], as may be appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors; and

                (iv) the allocation of risk retention obligations between a securitizer and an originator in the case of a securitizer that purchases assets from an originator, as the Federal banking agencies and the Commission jointly determine appropriate.

                The regulations prescribed under subsection (b) shall establish asset classes with separate rules for securitizers of different classes of assets, including residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, commercial loans, auto loans, and any other class of assets that the Federal banking agencies and the Commission deem appropriate.

            (B) __Contents__ 

                For each asset class established under subparagraph (A), the regulations prescribed under subsection (b) shall include underwriting standards established by the Federal banking agencies that specify the terms, conditions, and characteristics of a loan within the asset class that indicate a low credit risk with respect to the loan.

    (d) __Originators__ 

    In determining how to allocate risk retention obligations between a securitizer and an originator under subsection (c)(1)(E)(iv), the Federal banking agencies and the Commission shall—

        (1) reduce the percentage of risk retention obligations required of the securitizer by the percentage of risk retention obligations required of the originator; and

        (2)

         consider—

            (A) whether the assets sold to the securitizer have terms, conditions, and characteristics that reflect low credit risk;

            (B) whether the form or volume of transactions in securitization markets creates incentives for imprudent origination of the type of loan or asset to be sold to the securitizer; and

            (C) the potential impact of the risk retention obligations on the access of consumers and businesses to credit on reasonable terms, which may not include the transfer of credit risk to a third party.

    (e) __Exemptions, exceptions, and adjustments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Federal banking agencies and the Commission may jointly adopt or issue exemptions, exceptions, or adjustments to the rules issued under this section, including exemptions, exceptions, or adjustments for classes of institutions or assets relating to the risk retention requirement and the prohibition on hedging under subsection (c)(1).

            (B) __Other Federal programs__ 

                This section shall not apply to any residential, multifamily, or health care facility mortgage loan asset, or securitization based directly or indirectly on such an asset, which is insured or guaranteed by the United States or an agency of the United States. For purposes of this subsection, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Federal home loan banks shall not be considered an agency of the United States.

            (B) __Qualified residential mortgage__ 

            The Federal banking agencies, the Commission, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency shall jointly define the term “qualified residential mortgage” for purposes of this subsection, taking into consideration underwriting and product features that historical loan performance data indicate result in a lower risk of default, such as—

                (i) documentation and verification of the financial resources relied upon to qualify the mortgagor;

                (ii)

                 standards with respect to—

                    (I) the residual income of the mortgagor after all monthly obligations;

                    (II) the ratio of the housing payments of the mortgagor to the monthly income of the mortgagor;

                    (III) the ratio of total monthly installment payments of the mortgagor to the income of the mortgagor;

                (iii) mitigating the potential for payment shock on adjustable rate mortgages through product features and underwriting standards;

                (iv) mortgage guarantee insurance or other types of insurance or credit enhancement obtained at the time of origination, to the extent such insurance or credit enhancement reduces the risk of default; and

                (v) prohibiting or restricting the use of balloon payments, negative amortization, prepayment penalties, interest-only payments, and other features that have been demonstrated to exhibit a higher risk of borrower default.

            (C) __Limitation on definition__ 

                The Federal banking agencies, the Commission, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency in defining the term “qualified residential mortgage”, as required by subparagraph (B), shall define that term to be no broader than the definition “qualified mortgage” as the term is defined under section 129C(c)(2) of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and regulations adopted thereunder.

        (6) __Certification__ 

            The Commission shall require an issuer to certify, for each issuance of an asset-backed security collateralized exclusively by qualified residential mortgages, that the issuer has evaluated the effectiveness of the internal supervisory controls of the issuer with respect to the process for ensuring that all assets that collateralize the asset-backed security are qualified residential mortgages.

    (f) __Enforcement__ 

    The regulations issued under this section shall be enforced by—

        (1) the appropriate Federal banking agency, with respect to any securitizer that is an insured depository institution; and

    (i) __Effective date of regulations__
