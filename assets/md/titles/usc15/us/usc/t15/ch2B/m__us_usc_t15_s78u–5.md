    (c) __Safe harbor__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, in any private action arising under this chapter that is based on an untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading, a person referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be liable with respect to any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, if and to the extent that—

            (A)

             the forward-looking statement is—

                (i) identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement; or

                (ii) immaterial; or

            (B)

             the plaintiff fails to prove that the forward-looking statement—

                (i) if made by a natural person, was made with actual knowledge by that person that the statement was false or misleading; or

                    (II) made or approved by such officer with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.

        (2) __Oral forward-looking statements__ 

        In the case of an oral forward-looking statement made by an issuer that is subject to the reporting requirements of [section 78m(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78m/a] or section 78o(d) of this title, or by a person acting on behalf of such issuer, the requirement set forth in paragraph (1)(A) shall be deemed to be satisfied—

            (A)

             if the oral forward-looking statement is accompanied by a cautionary statement—

                (i) that the particular oral statement is a forward-looking statement; and

                (ii) that the actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement; and

            (B)

             if—

                (i) the oral forward-looking statement is accompanied by an oral statement that additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statement is contained in a readily available written document, or portion thereof;

                (ii) the accompanying oral statement referred to in clause (i) identifies the document, or portion thereof, that contains the additional information about those factors relating to the forward-looking statement; and

                (iii) the information contained in that written document is a cautionary statement that satisfies the standard established in paragraph (1)(A).

        (3) __Availability__ 

            Any document filed with the Commission or generally disseminated shall be deemed to be readily available for purposes of paragraph (2).

        (4) __Effect on other safe harbors__ 

            The exemption provided for in paragraph (1) shall be in addition to any exemption that the Commission may establish by rule or regulation under subsection (g) of this section.

    (d) __Duty to update__ 

        Nothing in this section shall impose upon any person a duty to update a forward-looking statement.

    (e) __Dispositive motion__

    (f) __Stay pending decision on motion__ 

    In any private action arising under this chapter, the court shall stay discovery (other than discovery that is specifically directed to the applicability of the exemption provided for in this section) during the pendency of any motion by a defendant for summary judgment that is based on the grounds that—

        (1) the statement or omission upon which the complaint is based is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of this section; and

        (2) the exemption provided for in this section precludes a claim for relief.

    (g) __Exemption authority__ 

        In addition to the exemptions provided for in this section, the Commission may, by rule or regulation, provide exemptions from or under any provision of this chapter, including with respect to liability that is based on a statement or that is based on projections or other forward-looking information, if and to the extent that any such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, as determined by the Commission.

    (h) __Effect on other authority of Commission__ 

        Nothing in this section limits, either expressly or by implication, the authority of the Commission to exercise similar authority or to adopt similar rules and regulations with respect to forward-looking statements under any other statute under which the Commission exercises rulemaking authority.
