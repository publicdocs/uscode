    (a) __Independence of compensation committees__ 

        (1) __Listing standards__ 

            The Commission shall, by rule, direct the national securities exchanges and national securities associations to prohibit the listing of any equity security of an issuer, other than an issuer that is a controlled company, limited partnership, company in bankruptcy proceedings, open-ended management investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 \[[15 U.S.C. 80a–1][/us/usc/t15/s80a–1] et seq.\], or a foreign private issuer that provides annual disclosures to shareholders of the reasons that the foreign private issuer does not have an independent compensation committee, that does not comply with the requirements of this subsection.

        (2) __Independence of compensation committees__ 

        The rules of the Commission under paragraph (1) shall require that each member of the compensation committee of the board of directors of an issuer be—

            (A) a member of the board of directors of the issuer; and

            (B) independent.

        (3) __Independence__ 

        The rules of the Commission under paragraph (1) shall require that, in determining the definition of the term “independence” for purposes of paragraph (2), the national securities exchanges and the national securities associations shall consider relevant factors, including—

            (A) the source of compensation of a member of the board of directors of an issuer, including any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee paid by the issuer to such member of the board of directors; and

            (B) whether a member of the board of directors of an issuer is affiliated with the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the issuer.

        (4) __Exemption authority__ 

            The rules of the Commission under paragraph (1) shall permit a national securities exchange or a national securities association to exempt a particular relationship from the requirements of paragraph (2), with respect to the members of a compensation committee, as the national securities exchange or national securities association determines is appropriate, taking into consideration the size of an issuer and any other relevant factors.

    (b) __Independence of compensation consultants and other compensation committee advisers__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The compensation committee of an issuer may only select a compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser to the compensation committee after taking into consideration the factors identified by the Commission under paragraph (2).

        (2) __Rules__ 

        The Commission shall identify factors that affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser to a compensation committee of an issuer. Such factors shall be competitively neutral among categories of consultants, legal counsel, or other advisers and preserve the ability of compensation committees to retain the services of members of any such category, and shall include—

            (A) the provision of other services to the issuer by the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser;

            (B) the amount of fees received from the issuer by the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser, as a percentage of the total revenue of the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser;

            (C) the policies and procedures of the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest;

            (D) any business or personal relationship of the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser with a member of the compensation committee; and

            (E) any stock of the issuer owned by the compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser.

                The compensation committee of an issuer shall be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of a compensation consultant.

            (C) __Rule of construction__ 

            This paragraph may not be construed—

                (i) to require the compensation committee to implement or act consistently with the advice or recommendations of the compensation consultant; or

        (2) __Disclosure__ 

        In any proxy or consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of the shareholders (or a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting) occurring on or after the date that is 1 year after July 21, 2010, each issuer shall disclose in the proxy or consent material, in accordance with regulations of the Commission, whether—

            (A) the compensation committee of the issuer retained or obtained the advice of a compensation consultant; and

    Each issuer shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the compensation committee in its capacity as a committee of the board of directors, for payment of reasonable compensation—

        (1) to a compensation consultant; and

        (2) to independent legal counsel or any other adviser to the compensation committee.

    (f) __Commission rules__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Not later than 360 days after July 21, 2010, the Commission shall, by rule, direct the national securities exchanges and national securities associations to prohibit the listing of any security of an issuer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this section.

        (2) __Opportunity to cure defects__ 

            The rules of the Commission under paragraph (1) shall provide for appropriate procedures for an issuer to have a reasonable opportunity to cure any defects that would be the basis for the prohibition under paragraph (1), before the imposition of such prohibition.
