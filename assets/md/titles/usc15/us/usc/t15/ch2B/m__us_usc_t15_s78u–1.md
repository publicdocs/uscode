## § 78u–1. Civil penalties for insider trading

    (a) __Authority to impose civil penalties__ 

        (1) __Judicial actions by Commission authorized__ 

        Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has violated any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder by purchasing or selling a security or security-based swap agreement while in possession of material, nonpublic information in, or has violated any such provision by communicating such information in connection with, a transaction on or through the facilities of a national securities exchange or from or through a broker or dealer, and which is not part of a public offering by an issuer of securities other than standardized options or security futures products, the Commission—

            (A) may bring an action in a United States district court to seek, and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, a civil penalty to be paid by the person who committed such violation; and

            (B) may, subject to subsection (b)(1), bring an action in a United States district court to seek, and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, a civil penalty to be paid by a person who, at the time of the violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation.

        (2) __Amount of penalty for person who committed violation__ 

            The amount of the penalty which may be imposed on the person who committed such violation shall be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of such unlawful purchase, sale, or communication.

        (3) __Amount of penalty for controlling person__ 

            The amount of the penalty which may be imposed on any person who, at the time of the violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation, shall be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but shall not exceed the greater of $1,000,000, or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of such controlled person’s violation. If such controlled person’s violation was a violation by communication, the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the violation shall, for purposes of this paragraph only, be deemed to be limited to the profit gained or loss avoided by the person or persons to whom the controlled person directed such communication.

    (b) __Limitations on liability__ 

        (1) __Liability of controlling persons__ 

        No controlling person shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a)(1)(B) unless the Commission establishes that—

            (A) such controlling person knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that such controlled person was likely to engage in the act or acts constituting the violation and failed to take appropriate steps to prevent such act or acts before they occurred; or

            (B) such controlling person knowingly or recklessly failed to establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or procedure required under section 78o(f)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title or [section 80b–4a of this title][/us/usc/t15/s80b–4a] and such failure substantially contributed to or permitted the occurrence of the act or acts constituting the violation.

        (2) __Additional restrictions on liability__ 

            No person shall be subject to a penalty under subsection (a) solely by reason of employing another person who is subject to a penalty under such subsection, unless such employing person is liable as a controlling person under paragraph (1) of this subsection. [Section 78t(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78t/a] shall not apply to actions under subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Authority of Commission__ 

        The Commission, by such rules, regulations, and orders as it considers necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may exempt, in whole or in part, either unconditionally or upon specific terms and conditions, any person or transaction or class of persons or transactions from this section.

    (d) __Procedures for collection__ 

        (1) __Payment of penalty to Treasury__ 

            A penalty imposed under this section shall be payable into the Treasury of the United States, except as otherwise provided in [section 7246 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s7246] and [section 78u–6 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78u–6].

        (2) __Collection of penalties__ 

            If a person upon whom such a penalty is imposed shall fail to pay such penalty within the time prescribed in the court’s order, the Commission may refer the matter to the Attorney General who shall recover such penalty by action in the appropriate United States district court.

        (3) __Remedy not exclusive__ 

            The actions authorized by this section may be brought in addition to any other actions that the Commission or the Attorney General are entitled to bring.

        (4) __Jurisdiction and venue__ 

            For purposes of [section 78aa of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78aa], actions under this section shall be actions to enforce a liability or a duty created by this chapter.

        (5) __Statute of limitations__ 

            No action may be brought under this section more than 5 years after the date of the purchase or sale. This section shall not be construed to bar or limit in any manner any action by the Commission or the Attorney General under any other provision of this chapter, nor shall it bar or limit in any manner any action to recover penalties, or to seek any other order regarding penalties, imposed in an action commenced within 5 years of such transaction.

    (e) __Definition__ 

        For purposes of this section, “profit gained” or “loss avoided” is the difference between the purchase or sale price of the security and the value of that security as measured by the trading price of the security a reasonable period after public dissemination of the nonpublic information.

    (f) __Limitation on Commission authority__ 

        The authority of the Commission under this section with respect to security-based swap agreements shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations of [section 78c–1(b) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s78c–1/b].
