([Feb. 20, 1946, ch. 33][/us/act/1946-02-20/ch33], § 10, formerly § 4, [60 Stat. 24][/us/stat/60/24]; [Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch782], title XI, § 1106(a), [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972]; [Pub. L. 87–49][/us/pl/87/49], June 16, 1961, [75 Stat. 93][/us/stat/75/93]; renumbered § 10 and amended [Pub. L. 95–523, title I][/us/pl/95/523/tI], §§ 104, 110, Oct. 27, 1978, [92 Stat. 1893][/us/stat/92/1893], 1899; [Pub. L. 112–166][/us/pl/112/166], § 2(o), Aug. 10, 2012, [126 Stat. 1287][/us/stat/126/1287].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, referred to in subsec. (e), is [Pub. L. 95–523][/us/pl/95/523], Oct. 27, 1978, [92 Stat. 1887][/us/stat/92/1887], as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 58 (§ 3101 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 3101 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s3101] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    In subsec. (a), provisions that fixed the compensation of members of the Council have been omitted as obsolete. The positions of chairman and members of the Council are under the Executive Schedule, see sections 5313 and 5315 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

    In subsec. (b), provisions that authorized the Council to fix the compensation of such specialists and other experts as may be necessary for the carrying out of its functions under this chapter, without regard to “the Classification Act of 1923, as amended”, were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632] (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, into law). [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

    “Chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” substituted in subsec. (b) for “the Classification Act of 1949” on authority of [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], § 7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 631][/us/stat/80/631], the first section of which enacted Title 5.

 __Amendments__

The President shall designate one of the members of the Council as chairman and one as vice chairman, who shall act as chairman in the absence of the chairman.”

(1) “, and shall consult with the board or boards established under [section 1022f of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1022f]” after “as it deems advisable” and after par. (2) inserted provisions authorizing and directing the Council to seek and obtain the cooperation of executive and independent agencies in the development of specialized studies essential to its responsibilities.

    1961—Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 87–49][/us/pl/87/49] struck out provisions which limited the appropriations for salaries of the members and officers and employees of the Council to not more than $345,000 for each fiscal year.

    1949—Subsec. (b). Act Oct. 28, 1949, substituted “Classification Act of 1949” for “Classification Act of 1923”.
