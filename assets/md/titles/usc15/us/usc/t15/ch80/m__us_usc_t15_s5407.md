    (b) __Recordation__ 

        The Secretary shall establish, by regulation, a program to provide for the recordation of the insignias of manufacturers described in subsection (a).

([Pub. L. 101–592, § 5][/us/pl/101/592/s5], formerly § 8, Nov. 16, 1990, [104 Stat. 2950][/us/stat/104/2950]; renumbered § 5 and amended [Pub. L. 106–34, § 5][/us/pl/106/34/s5], June 8, 1999, [113 Stat. 122][/us/stat/113/122].)

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior [section 5 of Pub. L. 101–592][/us/pl/101/592/s5] was classified to [section 5404 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s5404], prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 106–34][/us/pl/106/34].

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 106–34, § 5(1)][/us/pl/106/34/s5/1], reenacted subsec. heading without change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “No fastener which is required by the standards and specifications to which it was manufactured to bear a raised or depressed insignia identifying its manufacturer or private label distributor shall be offered for sale or sold in commerce unless the manufacturer or private label distributor of such fastener has complied with the requirements prescribed by the Secretary in connection with the program established under subsection (b) of this section.”
