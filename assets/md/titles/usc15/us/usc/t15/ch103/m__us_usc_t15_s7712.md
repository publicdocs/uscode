## § 7712. Application to wireless

    (a) __Effect on other law__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to preclude or override the applicability of [section 227 of title 47][/us/usc/t47/s227] or the rules prescribed under [section 6102 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s6102].

    (b) __FCC rulemaking__ 

    The Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, shall promulgate rules within 270 days to protect consumers from unwanted mobile service commercial messages. The Federal Communications Commission, in promulgating the rules, shall, to the extent consistent with subsection (c)—

        (1) provide subscribers to commercial mobile services the ability to avoid receiving mobile service commercial messages unless the subscriber has provided express prior authorization to the sender, except as provided in paragraph (3);

        (2) allow recipients of mobile service commercial messages to indicate electronically a desire not to receive future mobile service commercial messages from the sender;

        (3)

         take into consideration, in determining whether to subject providers of commercial mobile services to paragraph (1), the relationship that exists between providers of such services and their subscribers, but if the Commission determines that such providers should not be subject to paragraph (1), the rules shall require such providers, in addition to complying with the other provisions of this chapter, to allow subscribers to indicate a desire not to receive future mobile service commercial messages from the provider—

            (A) at the time of subscribing to such service; and

            (B) in any billing mechanism; and

        (4) determine how a sender of mobile service commercial messages may comply with the provisions of this chapter, considering the unique technical aspects, including the functional and character limitations, of devices that receive such messages.

    (c) __Other factors considered__ 

        The Federal Communications Commission shall consider the ability of a sender of a commercial electronic mail message to reasonably determine that the message is a mobile service commercial message.

    (d) __Mobile service commercial message defined__ 

        In this section, the term “mobile service commercial message” means a commercial electronic mail message that is transmitted directly to a wireless device that is utilized by a subscriber of commercial mobile service (as such term is defined in [section 332(d) of title 47][/us/usc/t47/s332/d]) in connection with such service.
