            (B) other State laws to the extent that those laws relate to acts of fraud or computer crime.

    (c) __No effect on policies of providers of Internet access service__ 

        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to have any effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness, under any other provision of law, of the adoption, implementation, or enforcement by a provider of Internet access service of a policy of declining to transmit, route, relay, handle, or store certain types of electronic mail messages.
