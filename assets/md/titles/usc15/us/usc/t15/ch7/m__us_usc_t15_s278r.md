        (1) how each partner will participate in developing and carrying out the research agenda of the partnership;

        (2) the research that the grant would fund; and

        (3) how the research to be funded with the award would contribute to improved performance, productivity, and competitiveness of the United States manufacturing industry.

    (d) __Selection criteria__ 

    In selecting applications for awards under this section, the Director shall consider at a minimum—

        (1) the degree to which projects will have a broad impact on manufacturing;

        (2) the novelty and scientific and technical merit of the proposed projects; and

        (3) the demonstrated capabilities of the applicants to successfully carry out the proposed research.

    (e) __Distribution__ 

        In selecting applications under this section the Director shall ensure, to the extent practicable, a distribution of overall awards among a variety of manufacturing industry sectors and a range of firm sizes.

    (f) __Duration__ 

        In carrying out this section, the Director shall run a single pilot competition to solicit and make awards. Each award shall be for a 3-year period.
