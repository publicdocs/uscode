        There is established within the Institute a Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the “Committee”). The Committee shall consist of 15 members appointed by the Director, at least 10 of whom shall be from United States industry. The Director shall appoint as original members of the Committee any final members of the National Bureau of Standards Visiting Committee who wish to serve in such capacity. In addition to any powers and functions otherwise granted to it by this chapter, the Committee shall review and make recommendations regarding general policy for the Institute, its organization, its budget, and its programs within the framework of applicable national policies as set forth by the President and the Congress.

    (b) __Qualifications; recommendations for appointment__ 

    The persons appointed as members of the Committee—

        (1) shall be eminent in fields such as business, research, new product development, engineering, labor, education, management consulting, environment, and international relations;

        (2) shall be selected solely on the basis of established records of distinguished service;

        (3) shall not be employees of the Federal Government; and

        (4) shall be so selected as to provide representation of a cross-section of the traditional and emerging United States industries.

        The Director is requested, in making appointments of persons as members of the Committee, to give due consideration to any recommendations which may be submitted to the Director by the National Academies, professional societies, business associations, labor associations, and other appropriate organizations.

    (c) __Terms of office; eligibility__ 

        (1) The term of office of each member of the Committee, other than the original members, shall be 3 years; except that any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term. Any person who has completed two consecutive full terms of service on the Committee shall thereafter be ineligible for appointment during the one-year period following the expiration of the second such term.

        (2) The original members of the Committee shall be elected to three classes of three members each; one class shall have a term of one year, one a term of two years, and the other a term of three years.

    (d) __Meetings; quorum; notice__ 

        The Committee shall meet at least twice each year at the call of the Chairman or whenever one-third of the members so request in writing. A majority of the members of the Committee not having a conflict of interest in the matter being considered by the Committee shall constitute a quorum. Each member shall be given appropriate notice, whenever possible, not less than 15 days prior to any meeting, of the call of such meeting.

    (e) __Appointment by Committee of executive and other committees__ 

        The Committee shall have an executive committee, and may delegate to it or to the Secretary such of the powers and functions granted to the Committee by this chapter as it deems appropriate. The Committee is authorized to appoint from among its members such other committees as it deems necessary, and to assign to committees so appointed such survey and advisory functions as the Committee deems appropriate to assist it in exercising its powers and functions under this chapter.

    (f) __Chairman; Vice Chairman__ 

        The election of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall take place at each annual meeting occurring in an even-numbered year. The Vice Chairman shall perform the duties of the Chairman in his absence. In case a vacancy occurs in the chairmanship or vice chairmanship, the Committee shall elect a member to fill such vacancy.

    (g) __Professional and clerical staff__ 

        The Committee may, with the concurrence of a majority of its members, permit the appointment of a staff consisting of not more than four professional staff members and such clerical staff members as may be necessary. Such staff shall be appointed by the Director, after consultation with the Chairman of the Committee, and assigned at the direction of the Committee. The professional members of such staff may be appointed without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service and the provisions of chapter 51 of title 5 relating to classification, and compensated at a rate not exceeding the appropriate rate provided for individuals in grade GS–18 of the General Schedule under [section 5332 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5332], as may be necessary to provide for the performance of such duties as may be prescribed by the Committee in connection with the exercise of its powers and functions under this chapter.

    (h) __Annual and other reports to Secretary and Congress__ 

        (1) The Committee shall render an annual report to the Secretary for submission to the Congress not later than 30 days after the submittal to Congress of the President’s annual budget request in each year.
