## § 278g–3. Computer standards program

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Institute shall—

        (1) have the mission of developing standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for information systems;

        (3) develop standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems; and

        (4) carry out the responsibilities described in paragraph (3) through the Computer Security Division.

    (b) __Minimum requirements for standards and guidelines__ 

    The standards and guidelines required by subsection (a) of this section shall include, at a minimum—

        (1)

            (A) standards to be used by all agencies to categorize all information and information systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;

            (B) guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in each such category; and

            (C) minimum information security requirements for information and information systems in each such category;

        (2) a definition of and guidelines concerning detection and handling of information security incidents; and

        (3) guidelines developed in coordination with the National Security Agency for identifying an information system as a national security system consistent with applicable requirements for national security systems, issued in accordance with law and as directed by the President.

    (c) __Development of standards and guidelines__ 

    In developing standards and guidelines required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Institute shall—

        (1)

         consult with other agencies and offices (including, but not limited to, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Departments of Defense and Energy, the National Security Agency, the Government Accountability Office, and the Secretary of Homeland Security) to assure—

            (A) use of appropriate information security policies, procedures, and techniques, in order to improve information security and avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and

            (B) that such standards and guidelines are complementary with standards and guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems and information contained in such systems;

        (2) provide the public with an opportunity to comment on proposed standards and guidelines;

        (3)

         submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for promulgation under [section 11331 of title 40][/us/usc/t40/s11331]—
