The partnerships may also include government laboratories and nonprofit research institutions. The program shall—

        (1) include multidisciplinary, long-term research;

        (2) include research directed toward addressing needs identified through the activities of the Computer System Security  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.
