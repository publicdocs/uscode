    In order to carry out this section, the Director shall work with the private sector and appropriate Federal agencies to—

        (1) perform a needs assessment to identify and evaluate the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs required to improve the operation and reliability of such emergency communication and tracking technologies;

        (2) support the development of technical standards and conformance architecture to improve the operation and reliability of such emergency communication and tracking technologies; and

        (3) incorporate and build upon existing reports and studies on improving emergency communications.

    (c) __Report__ 

        Not later than 18 months after January 4, 2011, the Director shall submit to Congress and make publicly available a report describing the assessment performed under subsection (b)(1) and making recommendations about research priorities to address gaps in the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs identified by the assessment.
