## § 2303. Designation of written warranties

    (a) __Full (statement of duration) or limited warranty__ 

    Any warrantor warranting a consumer product by means of a written warranty shall clearly and conspicuously designate such warranty in the following manner, unless exempted from doing so by the Commission pursuant to subsection (c) of this section:

        (1) If the written warranty meets the Federal minimum standards for warranty set forth in [section 2304 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2304], then it shall be conspicuously designated a “full (statement of duration) warranty”.

        (2) If the written warranty does not meet the Federal minimum standards for warranty set forth in [section 2304 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2304], then it shall be conspicuously designated a “limited warranty”.

    (b) __Applicability of requirements, standards, etc., to representations or statements of customer satisfaction__ 

        This section and sections 2302 and 2304 of this title shall not apply to statements or representations which are similar to expressions of general policy concerning customer satisfaction and which are not subject to any specific limitations.

    (c) __Exemptions by Commission__ 

        In addition to exercising the authority pertaining to disclosure granted in [section 2302 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2302], the Commission may by rule determine when a written warranty does not have to be designated either “full (statement of duration)” or “limited” in accordance with this section.

    (d) __Applicability to consumer products costing more than $10 and not designated as full warranties__ 

        The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section apply only to warranties which pertain to consumer products actually costing the consumer more than $10 and which are not designated “full (statement of duration) warranties”.
