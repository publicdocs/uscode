## § 2650. Asbestos contractors and local educational agencies

    (a) __Study__ 

        (1) __General requirement__ 

        The Administrator shall conduct a study on the availability of liability insurance and other forms of assurance against financial loss which are available to local educational agencies and asbestos contractors with respect to actions required under this subchapter. Such study shall examine the following:

            (A) The extent to which liability insurance and other forms of assurance against financial loss are available to local educational agencies and asbestos contractors.

            (B) The extent to which the cost of insurance or other forms of assurance against financial loss has increased and the extent to which coverage has become less complete.

            (C) The extent to which any limitation in the availability of insurance or other forms of assurance against financial loss is the result of factors other than standards of liability in applicable law.

            (D) The extent to which the existence of the regulations required by subsections (c) and (d) of [section 2643 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2643] and the accreditation of contractors under [section 2646 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2646] has affected the availability or cost of insurance or other forms of assurance against financial loss.

            (E) The extent to which any limitation on the availability of insurance or other forms of assurance against financial loss is inhibiting inspections for asbestos-containing material or the development or implementation of management plans under this subchapter.

            (F) Identification of any other impediments to the timely completion of inspections or the development and implementation of management plans under this subchapter.

        (2) __Interim report__ 

            Not later than April 1, 1988, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress an interim report on the progress of the study required by this subsection, along with preliminary findings based on information collected to that date.

        (3) __Final report__ 

            Not later than October 1, 1990, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a final report on the study required by this subsection, including final findings based on the information collected.

    (b) __State action__ 

        On the basis of the interim report or the final report of the study required by subsection (a), a State may enact or amend State law to establish or modify a standard of liability for local educational agencies or asbestos contractors with respect to actions required under this subchapter.
