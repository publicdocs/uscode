            A statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action to prohibit or otherwise restrict the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce or use of a chemical substance—

                (i) for which the determination described in [section 2605(i)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/i/1] is made, consistent with the scope of the risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(D)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title; or

                (ii) for which a final rule is promulgated under [section 2605(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/a], after the effective date of the rule issued under [section 2605(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/a] for the chemical substance, consistent with the scope of the risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(D) 1 of this title.

            (C) __Significant new use__ 

                A statute or administrative action requiring the notification of a use of a chemical substance that the Administrator has specified as a significant new use and for which the Administrator has required notification pursuant to a rule promulgated under [section 2604 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2604].

        (2) __Effective date of preemption__ 

            Under this subsection, Federal preemption of statutes and administrative actions applicable to specific chemical substances shall not occur until the effective date of the applicable action described in paragraph (1) taken by the Administrator.

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g), beginning on the date on which the Administrator defines the scope of a risk evaluation for a chemical substance under [section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/D] and ending on the date on which the deadline established pursuant to [section 2605(b)(4)(G) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/G] for completion of the risk evaluation expires, or on the date on which the Administrator publishes the risk evaluation under [section 2605(b)(4)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/C], whichever is earlier, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish a statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of such chemical substance that is a high-priority substance designated under [section 2605(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/1/B/i].

        (2) __Effect of subsection__ 

            This subsection does not restrict the authority of a State or political subdivision of a State to continue to enforce any statute enacted, criminal penalty assessed, or administrative action taken, prior to the date on which the Administrator defines and publishes the scope of a risk evaluation under [section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/D].

    (d) __Exceptions__ 

        (1) __No preemption of statutes and administrative actions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendment made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, or scientific assessment implemented pursuant to this chapter, shall affect the right of a State or a political subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, scientific assessment, or any other protection for public health or the environment that—

                (i) is adopted or authorized under the authority of any other Federal law or adopted to satisfy or obtain authorization or approval under any other Federal law;

                (ii) implements a reporting, monitoring, or other information obligation for the chemical substance not otherwise required by the Administrator under this chapter or required under any other Federal law;

                (iii)

                 is adopted pursuant to authority under a law of the State or political subdivision of the State related to water quality, air quality, or waste treatment or disposal, except to the extent that the action—

                    (I) imposes a restriction on the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance; and

                    (II)

                        (aa) addresses the same hazards and exposures, with respect to the same conditions of use as are included in the scope of the risk evaluation published pursuant to [section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/D], but is inconsistent with the action of the Administrator; or

                        (bb) would cause a violation of the applicable action by the Administrator under section 2604 or 2605 of this title; or

                (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), is identical to a requirement prescribed by the Administrator.

            (B) __Identical requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__

                (ii) __Penalties__ 

                In the case of an identical requirement—

                    (I) a State or political subdivision of a State may not assess a penalty for a specific violation for which the Administrator has assessed an adequate penalty under [section 2615 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2615]; and

                    (II) if a State or political subdivision of a State has assessed a penalty for a specific violation, the Administrator may not assess a penalty for that violation in an amount that would cause the total of the penalties assessed for the violation by the State or political subdivision of a State and the Administrator combined to exceed the maximum amount that may be assessed for that violation by the Administrator under [section 2615 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2615].

        (2) __Applicability to certain rules or orders__ 

            (A) __Prior rules and orders__ 

                Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect under this section, as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Frank R.

Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act with respect to manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture, nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect of this section as in effect prior to the enactment of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act of any rule or order that is promulgated or issued with respect to such chemical substance or mixture under [section 2605 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605] after that effective date, unless the latter rule or order is with respect to a chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance and follows a designation of that chemical substance as a high-priority substance under [section 2605(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/1/B/i], the identification of that chemical substance under [section 2605(b)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/2/A], or the selection of that chemical substance for risk evaluation under [section 2605(b)(4)(E)(iv)(II) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/E/iv/II].

    (e) __Preservation of certain laws__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Nothing in this chapter, subject to subsection (g) of this section, shall—

            (A) be construed to preempt or otherwise affect the authority of a State or political subdivision of a State to continue to enforce any action taken or requirement imposed or requirement enacted relating to a specific chemical substance before April 22, 2016, under the authority of a law of the State or political subdivision of the State that prohibits or otherwise restricts manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance; or

        (1) __Discretionary exemptions__ 

        Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Administrator may, by rule, exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as may be prescribed in the rule, a statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action of that State or political subdivision of the State that relates to the effects of exposure to a chemical substance under the conditions of use if the Administrator determines that—

            (A) compelling conditions warrant granting the waiver to protect health or the environment;

            (B) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not unduly burden interstate commerce in the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance;

            (C) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not cause a violation of any applicable Federal law, rule, or order; and

            (D)

            (B) no later than the date that is 18 months after the date on which the Administrator has initiated the prioritization process for a chemical substance under the rule promulgated pursuant to [section 2605(b)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/1/A], or the date on which the Administrator publishes the scope of the risk evaluation for a chemical substance under [section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/4/D], whichever is sooner, the State or political subdivision of the State has enacted a statute or proposed or finalized an administrative action intended to prohibit or otherwise restrict the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of the chemical substance.

        (3) __Determination of a waiver request__ 

        The duty of the Administrator to grant or deny a waiver application shall be nondelegable and shall be exercised—

            (A) not later than 180 days after the date on which an application under paragraph (1) is submitted; and

            (B) not later than 110 days after the date on which an application under paragraph (2) is submitted.

        (5) __Notice and comment__ 

            Except in the case of an application approved under paragraph (9), the application of a State or political subdivision of a State under this subsection shall be subject to public notice and comment.

        (6) __Final agency action__ 

        The decision of the Administrator on the application of a State or political subdivision of a State shall be—

            (A) considered to be a final agency action; and

            (B) subject to judicial review.

            A waiver granted under paragraph (2) or approved under paragraph (9) shall remain in effect until such time as the Administrator publishes the risk evaluation under [section 2605(b) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b].

        (8) __Judicial review of waivers__ 

            Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Administrator makes a determination on an application of a State or political subdivision of a State under paragraph (1) or (2), any person may file a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the determination.

        (9) __Approval__ 

            (A) __Automatic approval__

            (B) __Requirements__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraph (6), approval of a waiver application under subparagraph (A) for failure to meet the deadline under paragraph (3)(B) shall not be considered final agency action or be subject to judicial review or public notice and comment.
