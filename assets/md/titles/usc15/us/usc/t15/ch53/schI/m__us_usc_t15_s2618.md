## § 2618. Judicial review

    (a) __In general__ 

        (1)

            (A) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, not later than 60 days after the date on which a rule is promulgated under this subchapter, subchapter II, or subchapter IV, or the date on which an order is issued under section 2603, 2604(e), 2604(f), or 2605(i)(1) of this title,, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  any person may file a petition for judicial review of such rule or order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for the circuit in which such person resides or in which such person’s principal place of business is located. Courts of appeals of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any action to obtain judicial review (other than in an enforcement proceeding) of such a rule or order if any district court of the United States would have had jurisdiction of such action but for this subparagraph.

            (B) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, courts of appeals of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any action to obtain judicial review (other than in an enforcement proceeding) of an order issued under this subchapter, other than an order under section 2603, 2604(e), 2604(f), or 2605(i)(1) of this title, if any district court of the United States would have had jurisdiction of such action but for this subparagraph.

            (C)

                (i) Not later than 60 days after the publication of a designation under [section 2605(b)(1)(B)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/b/1/B/ii], any person may commence a civil action to challenge the designation.

                (ii) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction over a civil action filed under this subparagraph.

        (2) Copies of any petition filed under paragraph (1)(A) shall be transmitted forthwith to the Administrator and to the Attorney General by the clerk of the court with which such petition was filed. The provisions of [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112] shall apply to the filing of the record of proceedings on which the Administrator based the rule or order being reviewed under this section and to the transfer of proceedings between United States courts of appeals.

    (b) __Additional submissions and presentations; modifications__ 

        If in an action under this section to review a rule, or an order under section 2603, 2604(e), 2604(f), or 2605(i)(1) of this title, the petitioner or the Administrator applies to the court for leave to make additional oral submissions or written presentations respecting such rule or order and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such submissions and presentations would be material and that there were reasonable grounds for the submissions and failure to make such submissions and presentations in the proceeding before the Administrator, the court may order the Administrator to provide additional opportunity to make such submissions and presentations. The Administrator may modify or set aside the rule or order being reviewed or make a new rule or order by reason of the additional submissions and presentations and shall file such modified or new rule or order with the return of such submissions and presentations. The court shall thereafter review such new or modified rule or order.

    (c) __Standard of review__ 

        (1)

            (A) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a)(1) for judicial review of a rule or order, the court shall have jurisdiction (i) to grant appropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), to review such rule or order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.

            (B)

 [Section 706 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s706] shall apply to review of a rule or order under this section, except that—

                    (II) an order under section 2603, 2604(e), 2604(f), or 2605(i)(1) of this title, the standard for review prescribed by paragraph (2)(E) of such section 706 shall not apply and the court shall hold unlawful and set aside such order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole; and

                (ii) the court may not review the contents and adequacy of any statement of basis and purpose required by [section 553(c) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553/c] to be incorporated in the rule or order, except as part of the record, taken as a whole.

        (2) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any rule or order reviewed in accordance with this section shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided in [section 1254 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1254].

    (d) __Fees and costs__
