([Pub. L. 94–469, title III, § 302][/us/pl/94/469/s302], as added [Pub. L. 100–551, § 1(a)][/us/pl/100/551/s1/a], Oct. 28, 1988, [102 Stat. 2755][/us/stat/102/2755]; amended [Pub. L. 103–382, title III, § 391(c)(4)][/us/pl/103/382/s391/c/4], 392(b)(2), Oct. 20, 1994, [108 Stat. 4022][/us/stat/108/4022], 4026; [Pub. L. 107–110, title X, § 1076(f)(2)][/us/pl/107/110/s1076/f/2], Jan. 8, 2002, [115 Stat. 2091][/us/stat/115/2091].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241], as in effect before enactment of the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, referred to in par. (1)(C), means [section 241 of Title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241], Education, prior to its repeal by [Pub. L. 103–382, title III, § 331(b)][/us/pl/103/382/s331/b], Oct. 20, 1994, [108 Stat. 3965][/us/stat/108/3965].

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—Par. (1)(A). [Pub. L. 107–110][/us/pl/107/110] substituted “7801” for “8801”.

    1994—Par. (1)(A). [Pub. L. 103–382, § 391(c)(4)(A)][/us/pl/103/382/s391/c/4/A], made technical amendment to reference to [section 8801 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s8801] to reflect change in reference to corresponding section of original act.

    Par. (1)(C). [Pub. L. 103–382][/us/pl/103/382] directed two separate amendments of par. (1)(C), the first, by [section 391(c)(4)(B) of Pub. L. 103–382][/us/pl/103/382/s391/c/4/B], directed the insertion of “or successor authority” immediately after “[section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241]”, the second, by [section 392(b)(2) of Pub. L. 103–382][/us/pl/103/382/s392/b/2], directed the insertion (without reference to the first amendment) of “as in effect before enactment of the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994” immediately after “[section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241],”. Literal execution of the second amendment was not possible, as “[section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241],” was amended to read “[section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241] or successor authority,” by the first amendment. Commas were editorially inserted before and after the phrase added by the second amendment and it was inserted immediately after “[section 241 of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s241]” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Effective Date of 2002 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 107–110][/us/pl/107/110] effective Jan. 8, 2002, except with respect to certain noncompetitive programs and competitive programs, see [section 5 of Pub. L. 107–110][/us/pl/107/110/s5], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 6301 of Title 20][/us/usc/t20/s6301], Education.
