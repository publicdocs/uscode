## § 2624. Studies

    (a) __Indemnification study__ 

    The Administrator shall conduct a study of all Federal laws administered by the Administrator for the purpose of determining whether and under what conditions, if any, indemnification should be accorded any person as a result of any action taken by the Administrator under any such law. The study shall—

        (1) include an estimate of the probable cost of any indemnification programs which may be recommended;

        (2) include an examination of all viable means of financing the cost of any recommended indemnification; and

        (3) be completed and submitted to Congress within two years from the effective date of enactment of this chapter.

        The General Accounting Office shall review the adequacy of the study submitted to Congress pursuant to paragraph (3) and shall report the results of its review to the Congress within six months of the date such study is submitted to Congress.

    (b) __Classification, storage, and retrieval study__ 

        The Council on Environmental Quality, in consultation with the Administrator, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other appropriate Federal departments or agencies, shall coordinate a study of the feasibility of establishing (1) a standard classification system for chemical substances and related substances, and (2) a standard means for storing and for obtaining rapid access to information respecting such substances. A report on such study shall be completed and submitted to Congress not later than 18 months after the effective date of enactment of this chapter.
