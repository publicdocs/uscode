## § 2607. Reporting and retention of information

    (a) __Reports__ 

        (1)

         The Administrator shall promulgate rules under which—

            (A) each person (other than a small manufacturer or processor) who manufactures or processes or proposes to manufacture or process a chemical substance (other than a chemical substance described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) shall maintain such records, and shall submit to the Administrator such reports, as the Administrator may reasonably require, and

            (B)

             each person (other than a small manufacturer or processor) who manufactures or processes or proposes to manufacture or process—

                (i) a mixture, or

                (ii) a chemical substance in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such substance or another substance, including any such research or analysis for the development of a product,

                shall maintain records and submit to the Administrator reports but only to the extent the Administrator determines the maintenance of records or submission of reports, or both, is necessary for the effective enforcement of this chapter.

            The Administrator may not require in a rule promulgated under this paragraph the maintenance of records or the submission of reports with respect to changes in the proportions of the components of a mixture unless the Administrator finds that the maintenance of such records or the submission of such reports, or both, is necessary for the effective enforcement of this chapter. For purposes of the compilation of the list of chemical substances required under subsection (b), the Administrator shall promulgate rules pursuant to this subsection not later than 180 days after January 1, 1977.

        (2)

         The Administrator may require under paragraph (1) maintenance of records and reporting with respect to the following insofar as known to the person making the report or insofar as reasonably ascertainable:

            (A) The common or trade name, the chemical identity, and the molecular structure of each chemical substance or mixture for which such a report is required.

            (B) The categories or proposed categories of use of each such substance or mixture.

            (C) The total amount of each such substance and mixture manufactured or processed, reasonable estimates of the total amount to be manufactured or processed, the amount manufactured or processed for each of its categories of use, and reasonable estimates of the amount to be manufactured or processed for each of its categories of use or proposed categories of use.

            (D) A description of the byproducts resulting from the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of each such substance or mixture.

            (E) All existing information concerning the environmental and health effects of such substance or mixture.

            (F) The number of individuals exposed, and reasonable estimates of the number who will be exposed, to such substance or mixture in their places of employment and the duration of such exposure.

            (G) In the initial report under paragraph (1) on such substance or mixture, the manner or method of its disposal, and in any subsequent report on such substance or mixture, any change in such manner or method.

        (3)

            (A)

                (i) The Administrator may by rule require a small manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance to submit to the Administrator such information respecting the chemical substance as the Administrator may require for publication of the first list of chemical substances required by subsection (b).

                (ii)

                 The Administrator may by rule require a small manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance or mixture—

                    (I) subject to a rule proposed or promulgated under section 2603, 2604(b)(4), or 2605 of this title,,  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  an order in effect under section 2603 or 2604(e) of this title, or a consent agreement under [section 2603 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2603], or

                    (II) with respect to which relief has been granted pursuant to a civil action brought under section 2604 or 2606 of this title,

                    to maintain such records on such substance or mixture, and to submit to the Administrator such reports on such substance or mixture, as the Administrator may reasonably require. A rule under this clause requiring reporting may require reporting with respect to the matters referred to in paragraph (2).

            (B) The Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, shall by rule prescribe standards for determining the manufacturers and processors which qualify as small manufacturers and processors for purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (1).

            (C)

             Not later than 180 days after June 22, 2016, and not less frequently than once every 10 years thereafter, the Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, shall—

                (i) review the adequacy of the standards prescribed under subparagraph (B); and

                (ii) after providing public notice and an opportunity for comment, make a determination as to whether revision of the standards is warranted.

        (4)  __Contents__  __.—__ 

        The rules promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1)—

            (A) may impose differing reporting and recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers and processors; and

            (B) shall include the level of detail necessary to be reported, including the manner by which use and exposure information may be reported.

        (5)  __Administration__  __.—__ 

        In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall, to the extent feasible—

            (A) not require reporting which is unnecessary or duplicative;

            (B) minimize the cost of compliance with this section and the rules issued thereunder on small manufacturers and processors; and

            (C) apply any reporting obligations to those persons likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of this subchapter.

        (6)  __Negotiated rulemaking__  __.—__ 

            (A) The Administrator shall enter into a negotiated rulemaking pursuant to subchapter III of chapter 5 of title 5 to develop and publish, not later than 3 years after June 22, 2016, a proposed rule providing for limiting the reporting requirements, under this subsection, for manufacturers of any inorganic byproducts, when such byproducts, whether by the byproduct manufacturer or by any other person, are subsequently recycled, reused, or reprocessed.

            (B) Not later than 3 and one-half years after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall publish a final rule resulting from such negotiated rulemaking.

    (b) __Inventory__ 

        (1) The Administrator shall compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance which is manufactured or processed in the United States. Such list shall at least include each chemical substance which any person reports, under [section 2604 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2604] or subsection (a) of this section, is manufactured or processed in the United States. Such list may not include any chemical substance which was not manufactured or processed in the United States within three years before the effective date of the rules promulgated pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a)(1). In the case of a chemical substance for which a notice is submitted in accordance with [section 2604 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2604], such chemical substance shall be included in such list as of the earliest date (as determined by the Administrator) on which such substance was manufactured or processed in the United States. The Administrator shall first publish such a list not later than 315 days after January 1, 1977. The Administrator shall not include in such list any chemical substance which is manufactured or processed only in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such substance or another substance, including such research or analysis for the development of a product.

        (2) To the extent consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the Administrator may, in lieu of listing, pursuant to paragraph (1), a chemical substance individually, list a category of chemical substances in which such substance is included.
