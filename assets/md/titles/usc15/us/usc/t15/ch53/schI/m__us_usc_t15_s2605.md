## § 2605. Prioritization, risk evaluation, and regulation of chemical substances and mixtures

    (a) __Scope of regulation__ 

    If the Administrator determines in accordance with subsection (b)(4)(A) that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator shall by rule and subject to [section 2617 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2617], and in accordance with subsection (c)(2), apply one or more of the following requirements to such substance or mixture to the extent necessary so that the chemical substance or mixture no longer presents such risk:

        (1) A requirement (A) prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture, or (B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce.

        (2)

         A requirement—

            (A) prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement, or

            (B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement.

        (3) A requirement that such substance or mixture or any article containing such substance or mixture be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate minimum warnings and instructions with respect to its use, distribution in commerce, or disposal or with respect to any combination of such activities. The form and content of such minimum warnings and instructions shall be prescribed by the Administrator.

        (4) A requirement that manufacturers and processors of such substance or mixture make and retain records of the processes used to manufacture or process such substance or mixture or monitor or conduct tests which are reasonable and necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of any rule applicable under this subsection.

        (5) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of commercial use of such substance or mixture.

        (6)

            (A) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of disposal of such substance or mixture, or of any article containing such substance or mixture, by its manufacturer or processor or by any other person who uses, or disposes of, it for commercial purposes.

            (B) A requirement under subparagraph (A) may not require any person to take any action which would be in violation of any law or requirement of, or in effect for, a State or political subdivision, and shall require each person subject to it to notify each State and political subdivision in which a required disposal may occur of such disposal.

        (7) A requirement directing manufacturers or processors of such substance or mixture (A) to give notice of such determination to distributors in commerce of such substance or mixture and, to the extent reasonably ascertainable, to other persons in possession of such substance or mixture or exposed to such substance or mixture, (B) to give public notice of such determination, and (C) to replace or repurchase such substance or mixture as elected by the person to which the requirement is directed.

        Any requirement (or combination of requirements) imposed under this subsection may be limited in application to specified geographic areas.

    (b) __Risk evaluations__ 

        (1) __Prioritization for risk evaluations__ 

            (A) __Establishment of process__ 

                Not later than 1 year after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall establish, by rule, a risk-based screening process, including criteria for designating chemical substances as high-priority substances for risk evaluations or low-priority substances for which risk evaluations are not warranted at the time. The process to designate the priority of chemical substances shall include a consideration of the hazard and exposure potential of a chemical substance or a category of chemical substances (including consideration of persistence and bioaccumulation, potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations and storage near significant sources of drinking water), the conditions of use or significant changes in the conditions of use of the chemical substance, and the volume or significant changes in the volume of the chemical substance manufactured or processed.

            (B) __Identification of priorities for risk evaluation__ 

                (i) __High-priority substances__ 

                    The Administrator shall designate as a high-priority substance a chemical substance that the Administrator concludes, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment because of a potential hazard and a potential route of exposure under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator.

                (ii) __Low-priority substances__ 

                    The Administrator shall designate a chemical substance as a low-priority substance if the Administrator concludes, based on information sufficient to establish, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, that such substance does not meet the standard identified in clause (i) for designating a chemical substance a high-priority substance.

            (C) __Information request and review and proposed and final prioritization designation__ 

            The rulemaking required in subparagraph (A) shall ensure that the time required to make a priority designation of a chemical substance be no shorter than nine months and no longer than 1 year, and that the process for such designations includes—

                (i) a requirement that the Administrator request interested persons to submit relevant information on a chemical substance that the Administrator has initiated the prioritization process on, before proposing a priority designation for the chemical substance, and provide 90 days for such information to be provided;

                (ii) a requirement that the Administrator publish each proposed designation of a chemical substance as a high- or low-priority substance, along with an identification of the information, analysis, and basis used to make the proposed designations, and provide 90 days for public comment on each such proposed designation; and

                (iii) a process by which the Administrator may extend the deadline in clause (i) for up to three months in order to receive or evaluate information required to be submitted in accordance with [section 2603(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2603/a/2/B], subject to the limitation that if the information available to the Administrator at the end of such an extension remains insufficient to enable the designation of the chemical substance as a low-priority substance, the Administrator shall designate the chemical substance as a high-priority substance.

        (2) __Initial risk evaluations and subsequent designations of high- and low-priority substances__ 

            (A) __Initial risk evaluations__ 

                Not later than 180 days after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall ensure that risk evaluations are being conducted on 10 chemical substances drawn from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments and shall publish the list of such chemical substances during the 180 day period.

            (B) __Additional risk evaluations__ 

                Not later than three and one half years after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall ensure that risk evaluations are being conducted on at least 20 high-priority substances and that at least 20 chemical substances have been designated as low-priority substances, subject to the limitation that at least 50 percent of all chemical substances on which risk evaluations are being conducted by the Administrator are drawn from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments.

            (C) __Continuing designations and risk evaluations__ 

                The Administrator shall continue to designate priority substances and conduct risk evaluations in accordance with this subsection at a pace consistent with the ability of the Administrator to complete risk evaluations in accordance with the deadlines under paragraph (4)(G).

            (D) __Preference__ 

            In designating high-priority substances, the Administrator shall give preference to—

                (i) chemical substances that are listed in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments as having a Persistence and Bioaccumulation Score of 3; and

                (ii) chemical substances that are listed in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments that are known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity.

            (E) __Metals and metal compounds__ 

                In identifying priorities for risk evaluation and conducting risk evaluations of metals and metal compounds, the Administrator shall use the Framework for Metals Risk Assessment of the Office of the Science Advisor, Risk Assessment Forum, and dated March 2007, or a successor document that addresses metals risk assessment and is peer reviewed by the Science Advisory Board.

        (3) __Initiation of risk evaluations; designations__ 

            (A) __Risk evaluation initiation__ 

                Upon designating a chemical substance as a high-priority substance, the Administrator shall initiate a risk evaluation on the substance.

            (B) __Revision__ 

                The Administrator may revise the designation of a low-priority substance based on information made available to the Administrator.

            (C) __Ongoing designations__ 

                The Administrator shall designate at least one high-priority substance upon the completion of each risk evaluation (other than risk evaluations for chemical substances designated under paragraph (4)(C)(ii)).

        (4) __Risk evaluation process and deadlines__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Administrator shall conduct risk evaluations pursuant to this paragraph to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by the Administrator, under the conditions of use.

            (B) __Establishment of process__

            (B) __Selecting requirements__ 

                In selecting among prohibitions and other restrictions, the Administrator shall factor in, to the extent practicable, the considerations under subparagraph (A) in accordance with subsection (a).

            (C) __Consideration of alternatives__ 

                Based on the information published under subparagraph (A), in deciding whether to prohibit or restrict in a manner that substantially prevents a specific condition of use of a chemical substance or mixture, and in setting an appropriate transition period for such action, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent practicable, whether technically and economically feasible alternatives that benefit health or the environment, compared to the use so proposed to be prohibited or restricted, will be reasonably available as a substitute when the proposed prohibition or other restriction takes effect.

            (D) __Replacement parts__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Administrator shall exempt replacement parts for complex durable goods and complex consumer goods that are designed prior to the date of publication in the Federal Register of the rule under subsection (a), unless the Administrator finds that such replacement parts contribute significantly to the risk, identified in a risk evaluation conducted under subsection (b)(4)(A), to the general population or to an identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.

                (ii) __Definitions__ 

                In this subparagraph—

                    (I) the term “complex consumer goods” means electronic or mechanical devices composed of multiple manufactured components, with an intended useful life of 3 or more years, where the product is typically not consumed, destroyed, or discarded after a single use, and the components of which would be impracticable to redesign or replace; and

                    (II) the term “complex durable goods” means manufactured goods composed of 100 or more manufactured components, with an intended useful life of 5 or more years, where the product is typically not consumed, destroyed, or discarded after a single use.

            (E) __Articles__ 

                In selecting among prohibitions and other restrictions, the Administrator shall apply such prohibitions or other restrictions to an article or category of articles containing the chemical substance or mixture only to the extent necessary to address the identified risks from exposure to the chemical substance or mixture from the article or category of articles so that the substance or mixture does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment identified in the risk evaluation conducted in accordance with subsection (b)(4)(A).

        (3) __Procedures__ 

        When prescribing a rule under subsection (a) the Administrator shall proceed in accordance with [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] (without regard to any reference in such section to sections 556 and 557 of such title), and shall also—

            (A) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking stating with particularity the reason for the proposed rule;

            (B) allow interested persons to submit written data, views, and arguments, and make all such submissions publicly available;

            (C) promulgate a final rule based on the matter in the rulemaking record; and

            (D) make and publish with the rule the determination described in subsection (a).

    (d) __Effective date__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In any rule under subsection (a), the Administrator shall—

            (A) specify the date on which it shall take effect, which date shall be as soon as practicable;

            (B) except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), specify mandatory compliance dates for all of the requirements under a rule under subsection (a), which shall be as soon as practicable, but not later than 5 years after the date of promulgation of the rule, except in a case of a use exempted under subsection (g);

            (C) specify mandatory compliance dates for the start of ban or phase-out requirements under a rule under subsection (a), which shall be as soon as practicable, but not later than 5 years after the date of promulgation of the rule, except in the case of a use exempted under subsection (g);

            (D) specify mandatory compliance dates for full implementation of ban or phase-out requirements under a rule under subsection (a), which shall be as soon as practicable; and

            (E) provide for a reasonable transition period.

        (2) __Variability__ 

            As determined by the Administrator, the compliance dates established under paragraph (1) may vary for different affected persons.

        (3)

            (A)

             The Administrator may declare a proposed rule under subsection (a) to be effective, and compliance with the proposed requirements to be mandatory, upon publication in the Federal Register of the proposed rule and until the compliance dates applicable to such requirements in a final rule promulgated under [section 2605(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2605/a] or until the Administrator revokes such proposed rule, in accordance with subparagraph (B), if—

                (i)

                 the Administrator determines that—

                    (I) the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture subject to such proposed rule or any combination of such activities is likely to result in an unreasonable risk of serious or widespread injury to health or the environment before such effective date without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors; and

                    (II) making such proposed rule so effective is necessary to protect the public interest; and

                (ii) in the case of a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or distribution of a chemical substance or mixture because of the risk determined under clause (i)(I), a court has in an action under [section 2606 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2606] granted relief with respect to such risk associated with such substance or mixture.

                Such a proposed rule which is made so effective shall not, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.

            (B) If the Administrator makes a proposed rule effective upon its publication in the Federal Register, the Administrator shall, as expeditiously as possible, give interested persons prompt notice of such action in accordance with subsection (c), and either promulgate such rule (as proposed or with modifications) or revoke it.

            (B) The Administrator may by rule authorize the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce or use (or any combination of such activities) of any polychlorinated biphenyl in a manner other than in a totally enclosed manner if the Administrator finds that such manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use (or combination of such activities) will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

            (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “totally enclosed manner” means any manner which will ensure that any exposure of human beings or the environment to a polychlorinated biphenyl will be insignificant as determined by the Administrator by rule.

        (3)

            (A)

             Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C)—

                (i) no person may manufacture any polychlorinated biphenyl after two years after January 1, 1977, and

                (ii) no person may process or distribute in commerce any polychlorinated biphenyl after two and one-half years after such date.

            (B)

             Any person may petition the Administrator for an exemption from the requirements of subparagraph (A), and the Administrator may grant by rule such an exemption if the Administrator finds that—

                (i) an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment would not result, and

                (ii) good faith efforts have been made to develop a chemical substance which does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and which may be substituted for such polychlorinated biphenyl.
