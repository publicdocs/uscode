        (2) under subsection (a)(2) before the expiration of 60 days after the plaintiff has given notice to the Administrator of the alleged failure of the Administrator to perform an act or duty which is the basis for such action or, in the case of an action under such subsection for the failure of the Administrator to file an action under [section 2606 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2606], before the expiration of ten days after such notification, except that no prior notification shall be required in the case of a civil action brought to compel a decision by the Administrator pursuant to [section 2617(f)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2617/f/3/B]; or
