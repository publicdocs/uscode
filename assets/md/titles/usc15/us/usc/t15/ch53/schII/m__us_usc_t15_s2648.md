## § 2648. Emergency authority

    (a) __Emergency action__ 

        (1) __Authority__ 

        Whenever—

            (A) the presence of airborne asbestos or the condition of friable asbestos-containing material in a school building governed by a local educational agency poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment, and

            (B) the local educational agency is not taking sufficient action (as determined by the Administrator or the Governor) to respond to the airborne asbestos or friable asbestos-containing material,

            the Administrator or the Governor of a State is authorized to act to protect human health or the environment.

        (2) __Limitations on Governor action__ 

            The Governor of a State shall notify the Administrator within a reasonable period of time before the Governor plans to take an emergency action under this subsection. After such notification, if the Administrator takes an emergency action with respect to the same hazard, the Governor may not carry out (or continue to carry out, if the action has been started) the emergency action.

        (3) __Notification__ 

        The following notification shall be provided before an emergency action is taken under this subsection:

            (A) In the case of a Governor taking the action, the Governor shall notify the local educational agency concerned.

            (B) In the case of the Administrator taking the action, the Administrator shall notify both the local educational agency concerned and the Governor of the State in which such agency is located.

        (4) __Cost recovery__ 

            The Administrator or the Governor of a State may seek reimbursement for all costs of an emergency action taken under this subsection in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the emergency action occurred. In any action seeking reimbursement from a local educational agency, the action shall be brought in the United States District Court for the district in which the local educational agency is located.

    (b) __Injunctive relief__ 

    Upon receipt of evidence that the presence of airborne asbestos or the condition of friable asbestos-containing material in a school building governed by a local educational agency poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment—

        (1) the Administrator may request the Attorney General to bring suit, or

        (2) the Governor of a State may bring suit,

        to secure such relief as may be necessary to respond to the hazard. The district court of the United States in the district in which the response will be carried out shall have jurisdiction to grant such relief, including injunctive relief.
