The regulations shall provide for the exclusion of any school building, or portion of a school building, if (1) an inspection of such school building (or portion) was completed before the effective date of the regulations, and (2) the inspection meets the procedures and other requirements of the regulations under this subchapter or of the “Guidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Materials in Buildings” (unless the Administrator determines that an inspection in accordance with the guidance document is inadequate). The regulations shall require inspection of any school building (or portion of a school building) that is not excluded by the preceding sentence.

    (c) __Circumstances requiring response actions__

            In the case of a response action for the circumstances described in subsection (c)(1)(C), methods for responding shall include methods identified in chapters 3 and 5 of the “Guidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Material in Buildings”, unless preventive measures will eliminate the reasonable likelihood that the asbestos-containing material will become damaged, deteriorated, or delaminated.

        (5) __Response action for potentially significantly damaged asbestos__ 

            In the case of a response action for the circumstances described in subsection (c)(1)(D), methods for responding shall include methods identified in chapter 5 of the “Guidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Material in Buildings”, unless preventive measures will eliminate the reasonable likelihood that the asbestos-containing material will become significantly damaged, deteriorated, or delaminated.
