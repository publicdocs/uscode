## § 2653. EPA study of asbestos-containing material in public buildings

Within 360 days after October 22, 1986, the Administrator shall conduct and submit to the Congress the results of a study which shall—

    (1) assess the extent to which asbestos-containing materials are present in public and commercial buildings;

    (2) assess the condition of asbestos-containing material in commercial buildings and the likelihood that persons occupying such buildings, including service and maintenance personnel, are, or may be, exposed to asbestos fibers;

    (3) consider and report on whether public and commercial buildings should be subject to the same inspection and response action requirements that apply to school buildings;

    (4) assess whether existing Federal regulations adequately protect the general public, particularly abatement personnel, from exposure to asbestos during renovation and demolition of such buildings; and

    (5) include recommendations that explicitly address whether there is a need to establish standards for, and regulate asbestos exposure in, public and commercial buildings.

([Pub. L. 94–469, title II, § 213][/us/pl/94/469/s213], as added [Pub. L. 99–519, § 2][/us/pl/99/519/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2987][/us/stat/100/2987].)
