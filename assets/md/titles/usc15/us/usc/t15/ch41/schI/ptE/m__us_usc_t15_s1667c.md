## § 1667c. Consumer lease advertising; liability of advertising media

    (a) __In general__ 

    If an advertisement for a consumer lease includes a statement of the amount of any payment or a statement that any or no initial payment is required, the advertisement shall clearly and conspicuously state, as applicable—

        (1) the transaction advertised is a lease;

        (2) the total amount of any initial payments required on or before consummation of the lease or delivery of the property, whichever is later;

        (3) that a security deposit is required;

        (4) the number, amount, and timing of scheduled payments; and

        (5) with respect to a lease in which the liability of the consumer at the end of the lease term is based on the anticipated residual value of the property, that an extra charge may be imposed at the end of the lease term.

    (b) __Advertising medium not liable__ 

        No owner or employee of any entity that serves as a medium in which an advertisement appears or through which an advertisement is disseminated, shall be liable under this section.

    (c) __Radio advertisements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        An advertisement by radio broadcast to aid, promote, or assist, directly or indirectly, any consumer lease shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) if such advertisement clearly and conspicuously—

            (A) states the information required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a);

            (B) states the number, amounts, due dates or periods of scheduled payments, and the total of such payments under the lease;

            (C)

             includes—

                (i)

                 a referral to—

                    (I) a toll-free telephone number established in accordance with paragraph (2) that may be used by consumers to obtain the information required under subsection (a); or

                    (II)

                     a written advertisement that—

                        (aa) appears in a publication in general circulation in the community served by the radio station on which such advertisement is broadcast during the period beginning 3 days before any such broadcast and ending 10 days after such broadcast; and

                        (bb) includes the information required to be disclosed under subsection (a); and

                (ii) the name and dates of any publication referred to in clause (i)(II); and

            (D) includes any other information which the Bureau determines necessary to carry out this part.

        (2) __Establishment of toll-free number__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of a radio broadcast advertisement described in paragraph (1) that includes a referral to a toll-free telephone number, the lessor who offers the consumer lease shall—

                (i) establish such a toll-free telephone number not later than the date on which the advertisement including the referral is broadcast;

                (ii) maintain such telephone number for a period of not less than 10 days, beginning on the date of any such broadcast; and

                (iii) provide the information required under subsection (a) with respect to the lease to any person who calls such number.

            (B) __Form of information__ 

                The information required to be provided under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be provided verbally or, if requested by the consumer, in written form.

        (3) __No effect on other law__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall affect the requirements of Federal law as such requirements apply to advertisement by any medium other than radio broadcast.
