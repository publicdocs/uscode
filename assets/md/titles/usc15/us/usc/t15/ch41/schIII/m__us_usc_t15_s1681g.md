    (g) __Disclosure of credit scores by certain mortgage lenders__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Any person who makes or arranges loans and who uses a consumer credit score, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, in connection with an application initiated or sought by a consumer for a closed end loan or the establishment of an open end loan for a consumer purpose that is secured by 1 to 4 units of residential real property (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “lender”) shall provide the following to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable:

                A person that is subject to the provisions of this subsection and that uses a credit score, other than a credit score provided by a consumer reporting agency, may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.

            (D) __Notice to home loan applicants__ 

                A copy of the following notice, which shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency providing a credit score that was used:

            “notice to the home loan applicant

                “In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

                “The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

                “Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.

                “If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.

                “If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.”.

            (E) __Actions not required under this subsection__ 

            This subsection shall not require any person to—

                (i) explain the information provided pursuant to subsection (f) of this section;

                (ii) disclose any information other than a credit score or key factors, as defined in subsection (f) of this section;

                (iii) disclose any credit score or related information obtained by the user after a loan has closed;

                (iv) provide more than 1 disclosure per loan transaction; or

                (v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.

            (F) __No obligation for content__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.

                (ii) __Limit on liability__ 

                    No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.

            (G) __Person defined as excluding enterprise__ 

                As used in this subsection, the term “person” does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of [section 4502 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s4502]).

        (2) __Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.

            (B) __No liability for disclosure under this subsection__ 

                A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.
