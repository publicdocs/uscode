    (a) __Disclosures required for remittance transfers__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each remittance transfer provider shall make disclosures as required under this section and in accordance with rules prescribed by the Bureau. Disclosures required under this section shall be in addition to any other disclosures applicable under this subchapter.

        (2) __Disclosures__ 

        Subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, a remittance transfer provider shall provide, in writing and in a form that the sender may keep, to each sender requesting a remittance transfer, as applicable to the transaction—

            (A)

             at the time at which the sender requests a remittance transfer to be initiated, and prior to the sender making any payment in connection with the remittance transfer, a disclosure describing—

                (i) the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged;

                (ii) the amount of transfer and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer; and

                (iii) any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, to the nearest 1/100th of a point; and

            (B)

             at the time at which the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer—

                (i)

                 a receipt showing—

                    (I) the information described in subparagraph (A);

                    (II) the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient; and

                    (III) the name and either the telephone number or the address of the designated recipient, if either the telephone number or the address of the designated recipient is provided by the sender; and

                (ii)

                 a statement containing—

                    (I) information about the rights of the sender under this section regarding the resolution of errors; and

                    (II)

                     appropriate contact information for—

                        (aa) the remittance transfer provider; and

                        (bb) the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number established under [section 5493 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s5493].

        (3) __Requirements relating to disclosures__ 

        With respect to each disclosure required to be provided under paragraph (2) a remittance transfer provider shall—

            (A) provide an initial notice and receipt, as required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2), and an error resolution statement, as required by subsection (d), that clearly and conspicuously describe the information required to be disclosed therein; and

            (B) with respect to any transaction that a sender conducts electronically, comply with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ([15 U.S.C. 7001][/us/usc/t15/s7001] et seq.).

        (4) __Exception for disclosures of amount received__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Subject to the rules prescribed by the Bureau, and except as provided under subparagraph (B), the disclosures required regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient shall be deemed to be accurate, so long as the disclosures provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the foreign currency to be received. This paragraph shall apply only to a remittance transfer provider who is an insured depository institution, as defined in [section 1813 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1813], or an insured credit union, as defined in [section 1752 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1752], and if—

                (i) a remittance transfer is conducted through a demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account that the sender holds with such remittance transfer provider; and

                (ii) at the time at which the sender requests the transaction, the remittance transfer provider is unable to know, for reasons beyond its control, the amount of currency that will be made available to the designated recipient.

            (B) __Deadline__ 

                The application of subparagraph (A) shall terminate 5 years after July 21, 2010, unless the Bureau determines that termination of such provision would negatively affect the ability of remittance transfer providers described in subparagraph (A) to send remittances to locations in foreign countries, in which case, the Bureau may, by rule, extend the application of subparagraph (A) to not longer than 10 years after July 21, 2010.

        (5) __Exemption authority__ 

        The Bureau may, by rule, permit a remittance transfer provider to satisfy the requirements of—

            (A) paragraph (2)(A) orally, if the transaction is conducted entirely by telephone;

            (B) paragraph (2)(B), in the case of a transaction conducted entirely by telephone, by mailing the disclosures required under such subparagraph to the sender, not later than 1 business day after the date on which the transaction is conducted, or by including such documents in the next periodic statement, if the telephone transaction is conducted through a demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account that the sender holds with the remittance transfer provider;

            (C) subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) together in one written disclosure, but only to the extent that the information provided in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) is accurate at the time at which payment is made in connection with the subject remittance transfer; and

            (D) paragraph (2)(A), without compliance with section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global Commerce Act \[[15 U.S.C. 7001(c)][/us/usc/t15/s7001/c]\], if a sender initiates the transaction electronically and the information is displayed electronically in a manner that the sender can keep.

        (6) __Storefront and Internet notices__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) __Prominent posting__ 

                    Subject to subparagraph (B), the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts, as the Bureau may determine, which notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged.

                (ii) __Onsite displays__ 

                    The Bureau may require the notice prescribed under this subparagraph to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.

                (iii) __Internet notices__ 

                    Subject to paragraph (3), the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the Internet to provide a notice, comparable to a storefront notice described in this subparagraph, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.

                (iv) __Rulemaking authority__ 

                    In prescribing rules under this subparagraph, the Bureau may impose standards or requirements regarding the provision of the storefront and Internet notices required under this subparagraph and the provision of the disclosures required under paragraphs (2) and (3).

            (B) __Study and analysis__ 

            Prior to proposing rules under subparagraph (A), the Bureau shall undertake appropriate studies and analyses, which shall be consistent with [section 1693b(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1693b/a/2], and may include an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, to determine whether a storefront notice or Internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer—

                (i) to compare prices for remittance transfers; and

                (ii) to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers.

    (b) __Foreign language disclosures__ 

        The disclosures required under this section shall be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office.

    (c) __Regulations regarding transfers to certain nations__ 

    If the Bureau determines that a recipient nation does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, the Bureau may prescribe rules (not later than 18 months after July 21, 2010) addressing the issue, which rules shall include standards for a remittance transfer provider to provide—

        (1) a receipt that is consistent with subsections (a) and (b); and

        (2) a reasonably accurate estimate of the foreign currency to be received, based on the rate provided to the sender by the remittance transfer provider at the time at which the transaction was initiated by the sender.

    (d) __Remittance transfer errors__ 

        (1) __Error resolution__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If a remittance transfer provider receives oral or written notice from the sender within 180 days of the promised date of delivery that an error occurred with respect to a remittance transfer, including the amount of currency designated in subsection (a)(3)(A) that was to be sent to the designated recipient of the remittance transfer, using the values of the currency into which the funds should have been exchanged, but was not made available to the designated recipient in the foreign country, the remittance transfer provider shall resolve the error pursuant to this subsection and investigate the reason for the error.

            (B) __Remedies__ 

            Not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of a notice from the sender pursuant to subparagraph (A), the remittance transfer provider shall, as applicable to the error and as designated by the sender—

                (i) refund to the sender the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer which was not properly transmitted;

                (ii) make available to the designated recipient, without additional cost to the designated recipient or to the sender, the amount appropriate to resolve the error;

                (iii) provide such other remedy, as determined appropriate by rule of the Bureau for the protection of senders; or

                (iv) provide written notice to the sender that there was no error with an explanation responding to the specific complaint of the sender.

        (2) __Rules__ 

        The Bureau shall establish, by rule issued not later than 18 months after July 21, 2010, clear and appropriate standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers, to protect senders from such errors. Standards prescribed under this paragraph shall include appropriate standards regarding record keeping, as required, including documentation—

            (A) of the complaint of the sender;

            (B) that the sender provides the remittance transfer provider with respect to the alleged error; and
