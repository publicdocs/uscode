        (3) reduce the annual percentage rate previously increased when a reduction is indicated by the review; and

        (4) in the event of an increase in the annual percentage rate, provide in the written notice required under [section 1637(i) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1637/i] a statement of the reasons for the increase.
