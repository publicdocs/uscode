        (2) __Exception for refund of de minimus__  __ <sup>\[__  __1__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __1__  __ So in original. Probably should be “de minimis”.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __amount__ 

            No refund shall be required under paragraph (1) with respect to the prepayment of any consumer credit transaction if the total amount of the refund would be less than $1.

        (3) __Applicability to refinanced transactions and acceleration by the creditor__ 

        This subsection shall apply with respect to any prepayment of a consumer credit transaction described in paragraph (1) without regard to the manner or the reason for the prepayment, including—

            (A) any prepayment made in connection with the refinancing, consolidation, or restructuring of the transaction; and

            (B) any prepayment made as a result of the acceleration of the obligation to repay the amount due with respect to the transaction.

    (b) __Use of “Rule of 78’s” prohibited__ 

        For the purpose of calculating any refund of interest required under subsection (a) for any precomputed consumer credit transaction of a term exceeding 61 months which is consummated after September 30, 1993, the creditor shall compute the refund based on a method which is at least as favorable to the consumer as the actuarial method.

    (c) __Statement of prepayment amount__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Before the end of the 5-day period beginning on the date an oral or written request is received by a creditor from a consumer for the disclosure of the amount due on any precomputed consumer credit account, the creditor or assignee shall provide the consumer with a statement of—

            (A) the amount necessary to prepay the account in full; and

            (B) if the amount disclosed pursuant to subparagraph (A) includes an amount which is required to be refunded under this section with respect to such prepayment, the amount of such refund.

        (4) __Additional statements subject to reasonable fees__ 

            Any creditor may impose a reasonable fee to cover the cost of providing any statement under paragraph (1) to any consumer in addition to the 1 free annual statement required under paragraph (3) if the amount of the charge for such additional statement is disclosed to the consumer before furnishing such statement.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For the purpose of this section—

        (1) __Actuarial method__ 

            The term “actuarial method” means the method of allocating payments made on a debt between the amount financed and the finance charge pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the accumulated finance charge and any remainder is subtracted from, or any deficiency is added to, the unpaid balance of the amount financed.
