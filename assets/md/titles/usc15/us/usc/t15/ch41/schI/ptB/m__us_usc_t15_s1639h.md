## § 1639h. Property appraisal requirements

    (a) __In general__ 

        A creditor may not extend credit in the form of a higher-risk mortgage to any consumer without first obtaining a written appraisal of the property to be mortgaged prepared in accordance with the requirements of this section.

    (b) __Appraisal requirements__ 

        (1) __Physical property visit__ 

            Subject to the rules prescribed under paragraph (4), an appraisal of property to be secured by a higher-risk mortgage does not meet the requirement of this section unless it is performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the mortgaged property.

        (2) __Second appraisal under certain circumstances__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the purpose of a higher-risk mortgage is to finance the purchase or acquisition of the mortgaged property from a person within 180 days of the purchase or acquisition of such property by that person at a price that was lower than the current sale price of the property, the creditor shall obtain a second appraisal from a different certified or licensed appraiser. The second appraisal shall include an analysis of the difference in sale prices, changes in market conditions, and any improvements made to the property between the date of the previous sale and the current sale.

            (B) __No cost to applicant__ 

                The cost of any second appraisal required under subparagraph (A) may not be charged to the applicant.

        (3) __Certified or licensed appraiser defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “certified or licensed appraiser” means a person who—

            (A) is, at a minimum, certified or licensed by the State in which the property to be appraised is located; and

            (B) performs each appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 \[[12 U.S.C. 3331][/us/usc/t12/s3331] et seq.\], and the regulations prescribed under such title, as in effect on the date of the appraisal.

                The Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Bureau shall jointly prescribe regulations to implement this section.

            (B) __Exemption__ 

                The agencies listed in subparagraph (A) may jointly exempt, by rule, a class of loans from the requirements of this subsection or subsection (a) if the agencies determine that the exemption is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.

    (c) __Free copy of appraisal__ 

        A creditor shall provide 1 copy of each appraisal conducted in accordance with this section in connection with a higher-risk mortgage to the applicant without charge, and at least 3 days prior to the transaction closing date.

    (d) __Consumer notification__ 

        At the time of the initial mortgage application, the applicant shall be provided with a statement by the creditor that any appraisal prepared for the mortgage is for the sole use of the creditor, and that the applicant may choose to have a separate appraisal conducted at the expense of the applicant.

    (e) __Violations__ 

        In addition to any other liability to any person under this subchapter, a creditor found to have willfully failed to obtain an appraisal as required in this section shall be liable to the applicant or borrower for the sum of $2,000.
