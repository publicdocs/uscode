## § 1681s–3. Affiliate sharing

    (a) __Special rule for solicitation for purposes of marketing__ 

        (1) __Notice__ 

        Any person that receives from another person related to it by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control a communication of information that would be a consumer report, but for clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of [section 1681a(d)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1681a/d/2/A], may not use the information to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer about its products or services, unless—

            (A) it is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer that the information may be communicated among such persons for purposes of making such solicitations to the consumer; and

            (B) the consumer is provided an opportunity and a simple method to prohibit the making of such solicitations to the consumer by such person.

        (2) __Consumer choice__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The notice required under paragraph (1) shall allow the consumer the opportunity to prohibit all solicitations referred to in such paragraph, and may allow the consumer to choose from different options when electing to prohibit the sending of such solicitations, including options regarding the types of entities and information covered, and which methods of delivering solicitations the consumer elects to prohibit.

            (B) __Format__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the notice required under paragraph (1) shall be clear, conspicuous, and concise, and any method provided under paragraph (1)(B) shall be simple. The regulations prescribed to implement this section shall provide specific guidance regarding how to comply with such standards.

        (3) __Duration__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The election of a consumer pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) to prohibit the making of solicitations shall be effective for at least 5 years, beginning on the date on which the person receives the election of the consumer, unless the consumer requests that such election be revoked.

            (B) __Notice upon expiration of effective period__ 

                At such time as the election of a consumer pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) is no longer effective, a person may not use information that the person receives in the manner described in paragraph (1) to make any solicitation for marketing purposes to the consumer, unless the consumer receives a notice and an opportunity, using a simple method, to extend the opt-out for another period of at least 5 years, pursuant to the procedures described in paragraph (1).

        (4) __Scope__ 

        This section shall not apply to a person—

            (A) using information to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with whom the person has a pre-existing business relationship;

            (B) using information to facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit the person provides employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan;

            (C) using information to perform services on behalf of another person related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, except that this subparagraph shall not be construed as permitting a person to send solicitations on behalf of another person, if such other person would not be permitted to send the solicitation on its own behalf as a result of the election of the consumer to prohibit solicitations under paragraph (1)(B);

            (D) using information in response to a communication initiated by the consumer;

            (E) using information in response to solicitations authorized or requested by the consumer; or

            (F) if compliance with this section by that person would prevent compliance by that person with any provision of State insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination in any State in which the person is lawfully doing business.

        (5) __No retroactivity__ 

            This subsection shall not prohibit the use of information to send a solicitation to a consumer if such information was received prior to the date on which persons are required to comply with regulations implementing this subsection.

    (b) __Notice for other purposes permissible__ 

        A notice or other disclosure under this section may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice required to be issued under any other provision of law by a person that is subject to this section, and a notice or other disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by subsection (a), and that is provided by a person described in subsection (a) to a consumer together with disclosures required by any other provision of law, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (a).

    (c) __User requirements__ 

        Requirements with respect to the use by a person of information received from another person related to it by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, such as the requirements of this section, constitute requirements with respect to the exchange of information among persons affiliated by common ownership or common corporate control, within the meaning of [section 1681t(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1681t/b/2].

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

        (1) __Pre-existing business relationship__ 

        The term “pre-existing business relationship” means a relationship between a person, or a person’s licensed agent, and a consumer, based on—

            (A) a financial contract between a person and a consumer which is in force;

            (B) the purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of that person’s goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or a policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and that person during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this section;

            (C) an inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or service offered by that person, during the 3-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this section; or

            (D) any other pre-existing customer relationship defined in the regulations implementing this section.

        (2) __Solicitation__ 

            The term “solicitation” means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is based on an exchange of information described in subsection (a), and is intended to encourage the consumer to purchase such product or service, but does not include communications that are directed at the general public or determined not to be a solicitation by the regulations prescribed under this section.
