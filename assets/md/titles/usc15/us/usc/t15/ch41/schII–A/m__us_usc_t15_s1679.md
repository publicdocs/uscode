## § 1679. Findings and purposes

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress makes the following findings:

        (1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.

        (2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.

    (b) __Purposes__ 

    The purposes of this subchapter are—

        (1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and

        (2) to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.
