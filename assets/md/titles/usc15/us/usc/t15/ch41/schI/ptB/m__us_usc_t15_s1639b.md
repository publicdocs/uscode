## § 1639b. Residential mortgage loan origination

    (a) __Finding and purpose__ 

        (1) __Finding__ 

            The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit, while ensuring that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers.

        (2) __Purpose__ 

            It is the purpose of this section and [section 1639c of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639c] to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive or abusive.

    (b) __Duty of care__ 

        (1) __Standard__ 

        Subject to regulations prescribed under this subsection, each mortgage originator shall, in addition to the duties imposed by otherwise applicable provisions of State or Federal law—

            (A) be qualified and, when required, registered and licensed as a mortgage originator in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, including the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 \[[12 U.S.C. 5101][/us/usc/t12/s5101] et seq.\]; and

            (B) include on all loan documents any unique identifier of the mortgage originator provided by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

        (2) __Compliance procedures required__ 

            The Bureau shall prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor the compliance of such depository institutions, the subsidiaries of such institutions, and the employees of such institutions or subsidiaries with the requirements of this section and the registration procedures established under section 1507 of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 \[[12 U.S.C. 5106][/us/usc/t12/s5106]\].

    (c) __Prohibition on steering incentives__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage originator shall receive from any person and no person shall pay to a mortgage originator, directly or indirectly, compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal).

        (2) __Restructuring of financing origination fee__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For any mortgage loan, a mortgage originator may not receive from any person other than the consumer and no person, other than the consumer, who knows or has reason to know that a consumer has directly compensated or will directly compensate a mortgage originator may pay a mortgage originator any origination fee or charge except bona fide third party charges not retained by the creditor, mortgage originator, or an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a mortgage originator may receive from a person other than the consumer an origination fee or charge, and a person other than the consumer may pay a mortgage originator an origination fee or charge, if—

                (i) the mortgage originator does not receive any compensation directly from the consumer; and

                (ii) the consumer does not make an upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees, however denominated (other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of the creditor or originator), except that the Bureau may, by rule, waive or provide exemptions to this clause if the Bureau determines that such waiver or exemption is in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.

        (3) __Regulations__ 

        The Bureau shall prescribe regulations to prohibit—

            (A)

             mortgage originators from steering any consumer to a residential mortgage loan that—

                (i) the consumer lacks a reasonable ability to repay (in accordance with regulations prescribed under [section 1639c(a) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639c/a]); or

                (ii) has predatory characteristics or effects (such as equity stripping, excessive fees, or abusive terms);

            (B) mortgage originators from steering any consumer from a residential mortgage loan for which the consumer is qualified that is a qualified mortgage (as defined in [section 1639c(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639c/b/2]) to a residential mortgage loan that is not a qualified mortgage;

            (C) abusive or unfair lending practices that promote disparities among consumers of equal credit worthiness but of different race, ethnicity, gender, or age; and

            (D)

             mortgage originators from—

                (i) mischaracterizing the credit history of a consumer or the residential mortgage loans available to a consumer;

                (ii) mischaracterizing or suborning the mischaracterization of the appraised value of the property securing the extension of credit; or

                (iii) if unable to suggest, offer, or recommend to a consumer a loan that is not more expensive than a loan for which the consumer qualifies, discouraging a consumer from seeking a residential mortgage loan secured by a consumer’s principal dwelling from another mortgage originator.

        (4) __Rules of construction__ 

        No provision of this subsection shall be construed as—

            (A) permitting any yield spread premium or other similar compensation that would, for any residential mortgage loan, permit the total amount of direct and indirect compensation from all sources permitted to a mortgage originator to vary based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal);

            (B) limiting or affecting the amount of compensation received by a creditor upon the sale of a consummated loan to a subsequent purchaser;

            (C) restricting a consumer’s ability to finance, at the option of the consumer, including through principal or rate, any origination fees or costs permitted under this subsection, or the mortgage originator’s right to receive such fees or costs (including compensation) from any person, subject to paragraph (2)(B), so long as such fees or costs do not vary based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal) or the consumer’s decision about whether to finance such fees or costs; or

            (D) prohibiting incentive payments to a mortgage originator based on the number of residential mortgage loans originated within a specified period of time.

    (d) __Liability for violations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of providing a cause of action for any failure by a mortgage originator, other than a creditor, to comply with any requirement imposed under this section and any regulation prescribed under this section, [section 1640 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1640] shall be applied with respect to any such failure by substituting “mortgage originator” for “creditor” each place such term appears in each such subsection. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “in such section.” </sup></sup> 

        (2) __Maximum__ 

            The maximum amount of any liability of a mortgage originator under paragraph (1) to a consumer for any violation of this section shall not exceed the greater of actual damages or an amount equal to 3 times the total amount of direct and indirect compensation or gain accruing to the mortgage originator in connection with the residential mortgage loan involved in the violation, plus the costs to the consumer of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.

    (e) __Discretionary regulatory authority__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Bureau shall, by regulations, prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be abusive, unfair, deceptive, predatory, necessary or proper to ensure that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section and [section 1639c of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639c], necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this section and [section 1639c of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639c], to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance with such sections, or are not in the interest of the borrower.

        (2) __Application__ 

            The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall be applicable to all residential mortgage loans and shall be applied in the same manner as regulations prescribed under [section 1604 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1604].

    (f) __Timeshare plans__ 

        This section and any regulations promulgated thereunder do not apply to an extension of credit relating to a plan described in section 101(53D) of title 11.
