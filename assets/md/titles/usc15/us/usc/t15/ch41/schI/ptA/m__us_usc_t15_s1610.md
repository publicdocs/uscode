## § 1610. Effect on other laws

    (a) __Inconsistent provisions; procedures applicable for determination__ 

        (1) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, this part and parts B and C of this subchapter, do not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, the Bureau shall determine whether any such inconsistency exists. If the Bureau determines that a State-required disclosure is inconsistent, creditors located in that State may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or form, and shall incur no liability under the law of that State for failure to use such term or form, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.

        (2) Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, the Bureau shall determine whether any disclosure required under the law of any State is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required under this subchapter. If the Bureau determines that a State-required disclosure is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required by this subchapter, then creditors located in that State may make such disclosure in compliance with such State law in lieu of the disclosure required by this subchapter, except that the annual percentage rate and finance charge shall be disclosed as required by [section 1632 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1632], and such State-required disclosure may not be made in lieu of the disclosures applicable to certain mortgages under [section 1639 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639].

    (b) __State credit charge statutes__ 

        Except as provided in [section 1639 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639], this subchapter does not otherwise annul, alter or affect in any manner the meaning, scope or applicability of the laws of any State, including, but not limited to, laws relating to the types, amounts or rates of charges, or any element or elements of charges, permissible under such laws in connection with the extension or use of credit, nor does this subchapter extend the applicability of those laws to any class of persons or transactions to which they would not otherwise apply. The provisions of [section 1639 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639] do not annul, alter, or affect the applicability of the laws of any State or exempt any person subject to the provisions of [section 1639 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639] from complying with the laws of any State, with respect to the requirements for mortgages referred to in section 1602(aa)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, except to the extent that those State laws are inconsistent with any provisions of [section 1639 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1639], and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.

    (c) __Disclosure as evidence__ 

        In any action or proceeding in any court involving a consumer credit sale, the disclosure of the annual percentage rate as required under this subchapter in connection with that sale may not be received as evidence that the sale was a loan or any type of transaction other than a credit sale.

    (d) __Contract or other obligations under State or Federal law__ 

        Except as specified in sections 1635, 1640, and 1666e of this title, this subchapter and the regulations issued thereunder do not affect the validity or enforceability of any contract or obligation under State or Federal law.

    (e) __Certain credit and charge card application and solicitation disclosure provisions__ 

        The provisions of subsection (c) of [section 1632 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1632] and subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of [section 1637 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1637] shall supersede any provision of the law of any State relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation which is subject to the requirements of [section 1637(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1637/c] or any renewal notice which is subject to the requirements of [section 1637(d) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1637/d], except that any State may employ or establish State laws for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of such sections.
