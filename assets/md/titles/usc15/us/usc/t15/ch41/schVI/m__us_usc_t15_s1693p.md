 __References in Text__ 

    For effective date of this subchapter, referred to in subsec. (a), see [section 921 of Pub. L. 90–321][/us/pl/90/321/s921], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 1693 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1693].

L. 90–321][/us/pl/90/321/s918] to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of [section 917 of title I of Pub. L. 90–321][/us/pl/90/321/s917] as section 918 by [Pub. L. 111–24, title IV, § 401(1)][/us/pl/111/24/s401/1], May 22, 2009, [123 Stat. 1751][/us/stat/123/1751].

L. 111–24][/us/pl/111/24] was effective 15 months after May 22, 2009, and the renumberings by [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203] were effective 1 day after July 21, 2010.
