## § 1641. Liability of assignees

    (a) __Prerequisites__ 

        Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subchapter, any civil action for a violation of this subchapter or proceeding under [section 1607 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1607] which may be brought against a creditor may be maintained against any assignee of such creditor only if the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement, except where the assignment was involuntary. For the purpose of this section, a violation apparent on the face of the disclosure statement includes, but is not limited to (1) a disclosure which can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate from the face of the disclosure statement or other documents assigned, or (2) a disclosure which does not use the terms required to be used by this subchapter.

    (b) __Proof of compliance with statutory provisions__ 

        Except as provided in [section 1635(c) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1635/c], in any action or proceeding by or against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor without knowledge to the contrary by the assignee when he acquires the obligation, written acknowledgement of receipt by a person to whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to this subchapter shall be conclusive proof of the delivery thereof and, except as provided in subsection (a), of compliance with this part. This section does not affect the rights of the obligor in any action against the original creditor.

    (c) __Right of rescission by consumer unaffected__ 

        Any consumer who has the right to rescind a transaction under [section 1635 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1635] may rescind the transaction as against any assignee of the obligation.

    (d) __Rights upon assignment of certain mortgages__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title shall be subject to all claims and defenses with respect to that mortgage that the consumer could assert against the creditor of the mortgage, unless the purchaser or assignee demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a reasonable person exercising ordinary due diligence, could not determine, based on the documentation required by this subchapter, the itemization of the amount financed, and other disclosure of disbursements that the mortgage was a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of this title. The preceding sentence does not affect rights of a consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter.

        (2) __Limitation on damages__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, relief provided as a result of any action made permissible by paragraph (1) may not exceed—

            (A) with respect to actions based upon a violation of this subchapter, the amount specified in [section 1640 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1640]; and

            (B)

             with respect to all other causes of action, the sum of—

                (i) the amount of all remaining indebtedness; and

                (ii) the total amount paid by the consumer in connection with the transaction.

        (3) __Offset__ 

            The amount of damages that may be awarded under paragraph (2)(B) shall be reduced by the amount of any damages awarded under paragraph (2)(A).

        (4) __Notice__ 

            Any person who sells or otherwise assigns a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa) 1 of this title shall include a prominent notice of the potential liability under this subsection as determined by the Bureau.

    (e) __Liability of assignee for consumer credit transactions secured by real property__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subchapter, any civil action against a creditor for a violation of this subchapter, and any proceeding under [section 1607 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1607] against a creditor, with respect to a consumer credit transaction secured by real property may be maintained against any assignee of such creditor only if—

            (A) the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement provided in connection with such transaction pursuant to this subchapter; and

            (B) the assignment to the assignee was voluntary.

        (2) __Violation apparent on the face of the disclosure described__ 

        For the purpose of this section, a violation is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement if—

            (A) the disclosure can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate by a comparison among the disclosure statement, any itemization of the amount financed, the note, or any other disclosure of disbursement; or

            (B) the disclosure statement does not use the terms or format required to be used by this subchapter.

    (f) __Treatment of servicer__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as an assignee of such obligation for purposes of this section unless the servicer is or was the owner of the obligation.

        (2) __Servicer not treated as owner on basis of assignment for administrative convenience__ 

            A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section on the basis of an assignment of the obligation from the creditor or another assignee to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation. Upon written request by the obligor, the servicer shall provide the obligor, to the best knowledge of the servicer, with the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the obligation or the master servicer of the obligation.

        (3) __“Servicer” defined__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “servicer” has the same meaning as in [section 2605(i)(2) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s2605/i/2].

        (4) __Applicability__ 

            This subsection shall apply to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.

    (g) __Notice of new creditor__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In addition to other disclosures required by this subchapter, not later than 30 days after the date on which a mortgage loan is sold or otherwise transferred or assigned to a third party, the creditor that is the new owner or assignee of the debt shall notify the borrower in writing of such transfer, including—

            (A) the identity, address, telephone number of the new creditor;

            (B) the date of transfer;

            (C) how to reach an agent or party having authority to act on behalf of the new creditor;

            (D) the location of the place where transfer of ownership of the debt is recorded; and

            (E) any other relevant information regarding the new creditor.

        (2) __Definition__ 

            As used in this subsection, the term “mortgage loan” means any consumer credit transaction that is secured by the principal dwelling of a consumer.
