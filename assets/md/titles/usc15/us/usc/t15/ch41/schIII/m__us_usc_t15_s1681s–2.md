        (1) __Prohibition__ 

            (A) __Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors__ 

                A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

            (B) __Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors__ 

            A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if—

                (i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and

                (ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.

            (C) __No address requirement__ 

                A person who clearly and conspicuously specifies to the consumer an address for notices referred to in subparagraph (B) shall not be subject to subparagraph (A); however, nothing in subparagraph (B) shall require a person to specify such an address.

            (D) __Definition__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate” means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.

        (2) __Duty to correct and update information__ 

        A person who—

            (A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the person’s transactions or experiences with any consumer; and

            (B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate,

            shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections to that information, or any additional information, that is necessary to make the information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not complete or accurate.

        (3) __Duty to provide notice of dispute__ 

            If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer.

        (4) __Duty to provide notice of closed accounts__ 

            A person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a consumer who has a credit account with that person shall notify the agency of the voluntary closure of the account by the consumer, in information regularly furnished for the period in which the account is closed.

        (5) __Duty to provide notice of delinquency of accounts__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action shall, not later than 90 days after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action.

            (B) __Rule of construction__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph only, and provided that the consumer does not dispute the information, a person that furnishes information on a delinquent account that is placed for collection, charged for profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, complies with this paragraph, if—

                (i) the person reports the same date of delinquency as that provided by the creditor to which the account was owed at the time at which the commencement of the delinquency occurred, if the creditor previously reported that date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency;

                (ii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency, and the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to obtain the date of delinquency from the creditor or another reliable source and reports that date to a consumer reporting agency as the date of delinquency; or

                (iii) the creditor did not previously report the date of delinquency to a consumer reporting agency and the date of delinquency cannot be reasonably obtained as provided in clause (ii), the person establishes and follows reasonable procedures to ensure the date reported as the date of delinquency precedes the date on which the account is placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action, and reports such date to the credit reporting agency.

        (6) __Duties of furnishers upon notice of identity theft-related information__ 

            (A) __Reasonable procedures__ 

                A person that furnishes information to any consumer reporting agency shall have in place reasonable procedures to respond to any notification that it receives from a consumer reporting agency under [section 1681c–2 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1681c–2] relating to information resulting from identity theft, to prevent that person from refurnishing such blocked information.

            (B) __Information alleged to result from identity theft__ 

                If a consumer submits an identity theft report to a person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency at the address specified by that person for receiving such reports stating that information maintained by such person that purports to relate to the consumer resulted from identity theft, the person may not furnish such information that purports to relate to the consumer to any consumer reporting agency, unless the person subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct.

                (iii) __Compliance using model__ 

                    A financial institution shall be deemed to be in compliance with subparagraph (A) if the financial institution uses any model form prescribed by the Bureau under this subparagraph, or the financial institution uses any such model form and rearranges its format.

            (E) __Use of notice without submitting negative information__ 

                No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution that has provided a customer with a notice described in subparagraph (A) to furnish negative information about the customer to a consumer reporting agency.

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Considerations__ 

            In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A), the agencies shall weigh—

                (i) the benefits to consumers with the costs on furnishers and the credit reporting system;

                (ii) the impact on the overall accuracy and integrity of consumer reports of any such requirements;

                (iii) whether direct contact by the consumer with the furnisher would likely result in the most expeditious resolution of any such dispute; and

                (iv) the potential impact on the credit reporting process if credit repair organizations, as defined in [section 1679a(3) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1679a/3], including entities that would be a credit repair organization, but for [section 1679a(3)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1679a/3/B/i], are able to circumvent the prohibition in subparagraph (G).

                (iii) complete such person’s investigation of the dispute and report the results of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period under [section 1681i(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s1681i/a/1] within which a consumer reporting agency would be required to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the information under that section; and

                (iv) if the investigation finds that the information reported was inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the person furnished the inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the agency any correction to that information that is necessary to make the information provided by the person accurate.

            (F) __Frivolous or irrelevant dispute__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                This paragraph shall not apply if the person receiving a notice of a dispute from a consumer reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, including—

                    (I) by reason of the failure of a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information; or
