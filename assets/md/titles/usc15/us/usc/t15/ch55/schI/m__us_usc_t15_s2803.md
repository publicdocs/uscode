                (iv) that the provisions of [section 2802 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2802], limiting the right of a franchisor to fail to renew a franchise relationship, are not applicable to such trial franchise.

        (2) The term “trial franchise” does not include any unexpired period of any term of any franchise (other than a trial franchise, as defined by paragraph (1)) which was transferred or assigned by a franchisee to the extent authorized by the provisions of the franchise or any applicable provision of State law which permits such transfer or assignment, without regard to any provision of the franchise.
