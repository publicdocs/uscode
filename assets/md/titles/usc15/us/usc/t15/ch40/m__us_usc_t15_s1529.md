## § 1529. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction over certain lands

Notwithstanding any other law, the Secretary of Commerce, whenever the Secretary considers it desirable, may relinquish to a State, or to a Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, all or part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over lands or interests under the Secretary’s control in that State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under this section may be accomplished—

    (1) by filing with the Governor (or, if none exists, with the chief executive officer) of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession concerned a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance of the notice; or

    (2) as required by the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession.
