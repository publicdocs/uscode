 __Codification__ 

    Provisions of last sentence that fixed the compensation of the Assistant Secretaries of Commerce have been omitted as the positions are under the Executive Schedule under [section 5315 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5315], Government Organization and Employees.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 592a of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s592a] prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 5 by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 378][/us/stat/80/378].

Said position was terminated by section 592a–1 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees. Section 8 of act May 20, 1926, was subsequently repealed by [Pub.
