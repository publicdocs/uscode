    (2) prepare and issue predictions of electromagnetic wave propagation conditions and warnings of disturbances in such conditions;

    (3) investigate conditions which affect the transmission of radio waves from their source to a receiver and the compilation and distribution of information on such transmission of radio waves as a basis for choice of frequencies to be used in radio operations;
