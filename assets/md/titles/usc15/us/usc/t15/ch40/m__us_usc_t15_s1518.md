## § 1518. Custody of buildings; officers transferred

    The Secretary of Commerce shall have charge, in the buildings or premises occupied by or appropriated to the Department of Commerce, of the library, furniture, fixtures, rec­ords, and other property pertaining to it or acquired for use in its business; and he shall be allowed to expend for periodicals and the purposes of the library, and for the rental of appropriate quarters for the accommodation of the Department of Commerce within the District of Columbia, and for all other incidental expenses, such sums as Congress may provide from time to time. Where any office, bureau, or branch of the public service transferred to the Department of Commerce is occupying rented buildings or premises, it may still continue to do so until other suitable quarters are provided for its use. All officers, clerks, and employees employed on February 14, 1903, in or by any of the bureaus, offices, departments, or branches of the public service transferred to the Department of Commerce are each and all transferred to said department, except where otherwise provided by law. All laws prescribing the work and defining the duties of the several bureaus, offices, departments, or branches of the public service transferred to and made a part of the Department of Commerce shall, so far as the same are not in conflict with the provisions of this Act, remain in full force and effect until otherwise provided by law.
