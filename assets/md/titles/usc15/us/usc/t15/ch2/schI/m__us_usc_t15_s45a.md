## § 45a. Labels on products

    To the extent any person introduces, delivers for introduction, sells, advertises, or offers for sale in commerce a product with a “Made in the U.S.A.” or “Made in America” label, or the equivalent thereof, in order to represent that such product was in whole or substantial part of domestic origin, such label shall be consistent with decisions and orders of the Federal Trade Commission issued pursuant to [section 45 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s45]. This section only applies to such labels. Nothing in this section shall preclude the application of other provisions of law relating to labeling. The Commission may periodically consider an appropriate percentage of imported components which may be included in the product and still be reasonably consistent with such decisions and orders. Nothing in this section shall preclude use of such labels for products that contain imported components under the label when the label also discloses such information in a clear and conspicuous manner. The Commission shall administer this section pursuant to [section 45 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s45] and may from time to time issue rules pursuant to [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] for such purpose. If a rule is issued, such violation shall be treated by the Commission as a violation of a rule under [section 57a of this title][/us/usc/t15/s57a] regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. This section shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register of a Notice of the provisions of this section. The Commission shall publish such notice within six months after September 13, 1994.

([Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXII], § 320933, Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2135][/us/stat/108/2135].)
