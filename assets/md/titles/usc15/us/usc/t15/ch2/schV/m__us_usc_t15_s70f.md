## § 70f. Injunction proceedings

    Whenever the Commission has reason to believe—

    (a) that any person is doing, or is about to do, an act which by section 70a, 70c, 70d, 70g, or 70h(b) of this title is declared to be unlawful; and

    (b) that it would be to the public interest to enjoin the doing of such act until complaint is issued by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act \[[15 U.S.C. 41][/us/usc/t15/s41] et seq.\] and such complaint is dismissed by the Commission or set aside by the court on review or until an order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act,

    the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States or in the United States court of any Territory, for the district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts business, to enjoin the doing of such act and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.
