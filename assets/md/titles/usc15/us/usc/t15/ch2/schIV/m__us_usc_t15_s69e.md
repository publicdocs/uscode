## § 69e. Name guide for fur products

    (a) __Fur Products Name Guide__ 

        The Commission shall, with the assistance and cooperation of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, within six months after August 8, 1951, issue, after holding public hearings, a register setting forth the names of hair, fleece, and fur-bearing animals, which shall be known as the Fur Products Name Guide. The names used shall be the true English names for the animals in question, or in the absence of a true English name for an animal, the name by which such animal can be properly identified in the United States.

    (b) __Additions and deletions; public hearing__ 

        The Commission may, from time to time, with the assistance and cooperation of the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior, after holding public hearings, add to or delete from such register the name of any hair, fleece, or fur-bearing animal.

    (c) __Prevention of confusion or deception__ 

        If the name of an animal (as set forth in the Fur Products Name Guide) connotes a geographical origin or significance other than the true country or place of origin of such animal, the Commission may require whenever such name is used in setting forth the information required by this subchapter, such qualifying statements as it may deem necessary to prevent confusion or deception.
