Such guaranty shall be either (1) a separate guaranty specifically designating the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed, in which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to such product, fabric, or related material; (2) a continuing guaranty given by seller to buyer applicable to any product, fabric, or related material sold or to be sold to buyer by seller in a form as the Commission by rules and regulations may prescribe; or (3) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission applicable to any product, fabric, or related material handled by a guarantor, in such form as the Commission by rules or regulations may prescribe.

    (b) __False guaranty__ 

        It shall be unlawful for any person to furnish, with respect to any product, fabric, or related material, a false guaranty (except a person relying upon a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received) with reason to believe the product, fabric, or related material falsely guaranteed may be introduced, sold, or transported in commerce, and any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of an unfair method of competition, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice, in commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act \[[15 U.S.C. 41][/us/usc/t15/s41] et seq.\].
