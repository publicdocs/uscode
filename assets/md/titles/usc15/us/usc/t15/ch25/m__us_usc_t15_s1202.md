        This chapter shall not apply to any fabric, related material, or product which is imported into the United States for dyeing, finishing, other processing, or storage in bond, and export from the United States, if such fabric, related material, or product, and any container in which it is enclosed, bears a stamp or label stating that such fabric, related material, or product is intended for export, and such fabric, related material, or product is in fact exported from the United States, unless the Commission determines that exportation of such fabric, related material, or product presents an unreasonable risk of injury to persons residing within the United States; except that this chapter shall apply to any such imported fabric, related material, or product manufactured for sale, offered for sale, or intended for shipment to any installation of the United States located outside of the United States.

    (c) __Statement of exportation: filing period, information; notification of foreign country; petition for minimum filing period; good cause__
