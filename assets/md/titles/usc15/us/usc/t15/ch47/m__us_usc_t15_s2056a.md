## § 2056a. Standards and consumer registration of durable nursery products

    (a) __Short title__ 

        This section may be cited as the “Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act”.

    (b) __Safety standards__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Commission shall—

            (A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and

            (B)

             in accordance with [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553], promulgate consumer product safety standards that—

                (i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or

                (ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.

        (2) __Timetable for rulemaking__ 

            Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.

        (3) __Judicial review__ 

            Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in [section 2060(g) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2060/g], as added by section 236 of this Act.

        (4) __Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard__ 

            (A) __Notice of adoption of voluntary standard__ 

                When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission’s action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.

            (B) __Commission action on revised voluntary standard__ 

                If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under [section 2058 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2058], effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.

    (c) __Cribs__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            It shall be a violation of [section 2068(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2068/a/1] for any person to which this subsection applies to manufacture, sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, offer, provide for use, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce a crib that is not in compliance with a standard promulgated under subsection (b).

        (2) __Persons to which subsection applies__ 

        This subsection applies to any person that—

            (A) manufactures, distributes in commerce, or contracts to sell cribs;

            (B) based on the person’s occupation, holds itself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to cribs, including child care facilities and family child care homes;

            (C) is in the business of contracting to sell or resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place cribs in the stream of commerce; or

            (D) owns or operates a place of public accommodation affecting commerce (as defined in [section 2203 of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2203] applied without regard to the phrase “not owned by the Federal Government”).

        (3) __Application of any revision__ 

            With respect to any revision of the standard promulgated under subsection (b)(1)(B) subsequent to the initial promulgation of a standard under such subsection, paragraph (1) shall apply only to a person that manufactures or imports cribs, unless the Commission determines that application to any other person described in paragraph (2) is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk to health or safety. If the Commission determines that application to a person described in paragraph (2) is necessary, it shall provide not less than 12 months for such person to come into compliance.

        (4) __Crib defined__ 

        In this subsection, the term “crib” includes—

            (A) new and used cribs;

            (B) full-sized or nonfull-sized cribs; and

            (C) portable cribs and crib-pens.

    (d) __Consumer registration requirement__ 

        (1) __Rulemaking__ 

        Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 6 of title 5 or the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 ([44 U.S.C. 3501][/us/usc/t44/s3501] et seq.), not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall, pursuant to its authority under [section 2065(b) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2065/b], promulgate a final consumer product safety rule to require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product—

            (A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;

            (B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and

            (C) to permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product.

        (2) __Requirements for registration form__ 

        The registration form required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) include spaces for a consumer to provide the consumer’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

            (B) include space sufficiently large to permit easy, legible recording of all desired information;

            (C) be attached to the surface of each durable infant or toddler product so that, as a practical matter, the consumer must notice and handle the form after purchasing the product;

            (D) include the manufacturer’s name, model name and number for the product, and the date of manufacture;

            (E) include a message explaining the purpose of the registration and designed to encourage consumers to complete the registration;

            (F) include an option for consumers to register through the Internet; and

            (G) include a statement that information provided by the consumer shall not be used for any purpose other than to facilitate a recall of or safety alert regarding that product.

            In issuing regulations under this section, the Commission may prescribe the exact text and format of the required registration form.

        (3) __Record keeping and notification requirements__ 

            The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.

        (4) __Study__ 

            The Commission shall conduct a study at such time as it considers appropriate on the effectiveness of the consumer registration forms required by this section in facilitating product recalls and whether such registration forms should be required for other children’s products. Not later than 4 years after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall report its findings to the appropriate Congressional committees.

    (e) __Use of alternative recall notification technology__ 

        (1) __Technology assessment and report__ 

        The Commission shall—

            (A) beginning 2 years after a rule is promulgated under subsection (d), regularly review recall notification technology and assess the effectiveness of such technology in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products; and

            (B) not later than 3 years after August 14, 2008, and periodically thereafter as the Commission considers appropriate, transmit a report on such assessments to the appropriate Congressional committees.

        (2) __Determination__ 

        If, based on the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission determines by rule that a recall notification technology is likely to be as effective or more effective in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products as the registration forms required by subsection (d), the Commission—

            (A) shall submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a report on such determination; and

            (B) shall permit a manufacturer of durable infant or toddler products to use such technology in lieu of such registration forms to facilitate recalls of durable infant or toddler products.

    (f) __Definition of durable infant or toddler product__ 

    As used in this section, the term “durable infant or toddler product”—

        (1) means a durable product intended for use, or that may be reasonably expected to be used, by children under the age of 5 years; and

        (2)

         includes—

            (A) full-size cribs and nonfull-size cribs;

            (B) toddler beds;

            (C) high chairs, booster chairs, and hook-on chairs;

            (D) bath seats;

            (E) gates and other enclosures for confining a child;

            (F) play yards;

            (G) stationary activity centers;

            (H) infant carriers;
