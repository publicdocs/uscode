## § 2053. Consumer Product Safety Commission

    (a) __Establishment; Chairman__ 

        An independent regulatory commission is hereby established, to be known as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, consisting of five Commissioners who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. In making such appointments, the President shall consider individuals who, by reason of their background and expertise in areas related to consumer products and protection of the public from risks to safety, are qualified to serve as members of the Commission. The Chairman shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from among the members of the Commission. An individual may be appointed as a member of the Commission and as Chairman at the same time. Any member of the Commission may be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other cause.

    (b) __Term; vacancies__ 

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), (A) the Commissioners first appointed under this section shall be appointed for terms ending three, four, five, six, and seven years, respectively, after October 27, 1972, the term of each to be designated by the President at the time of nomination; and (B) each of their successors shall be appointed for a term of seven years from the date of the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed.

        (2) Any Commissioner appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall be appointed only for the remainder of such term. A Commissioner may continue to serve after the expiration of this term until his successor has taken office, except that he may not so continue to serve more than one year after the date on which his term would otherwise expire under this subsection.

    (c) __Restrictions on Commissioner’s outside activities__ 

        Not more than three of the Commissioners shall be affiliated with the same political party. No individual (1) in the employ of, or holding any official relation to, any person engaged in selling or manufacturing consumer products, or (2) owning stock or bonds of substantial value in a person so engaged, or (3) who is in any other manner pecuniarily interested in such a person, or in a substantial supplier of such a person, shall hold the office of Commissioner. A Commissioner may not engage in any other business, vocation, or employment.

    (d) __Quorum; seal; Vice Chairman__ 

        No vacancy in the Commission shall impair the right of the remaining Commissioners to exercise all the powers of the Commission, but three members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except that if there are only three members serving on the Commission because of vacancies in the Commission, two members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and if there are only two members serving on the Commission because of vacancies in the Commission, two members shall constitute a quorum for the six month period beginning on the date of the vacancy which caused the number of Commission members to decline to two. The Commission shall have an official seal of which judicial notice shall be taken. The Commission shall annually elect a Vice Chairman to act in the absence or disability of the Chairman or in case of a vacancy in the office of the Chairman.

    (e) __Offices__ 

        The Commission shall maintain a principal office and such field offices as it deems necessary and may meet and exercise any of its powers at any other place.

    (f) __Functions of Chairman; request for appropriations__ 

        (1) The Chairman of the Commission shall be the principal executive officer of the Commission, and he shall exercise all of the executive and administrative functions of the Commission, including functions of the Commission with respect to (A) the appointment and supervision of personnel employed under the Commission (other than personnel employed regularly and full time in the immediate offices of commissioners other than the Chairman), (B) the distribution of business among personnel appointed and supervised by the Chairman and among administrative units of the Commission, and (C) the use and expenditure of funds.

        (2) In carrying out any of his functions under the provisions of this subsection the Chairman shall be governed by general policies of the Commission and by such regulatory decisions, findings, and determinations as the Commission may by law be authorized to make.

        (3) Requests or estimates for regular, supplemental, or deficiency appropriations on behalf of the Commission may not be submitted by the Chairman without the prior approval of the Commission.

    (g) __Executive Director; officers and employees__ 

        (1)

            (A) The Chairman, subject to the approval of the Commission, shall appoint as officers of the Commission an Executive Director, a General Counsel, an Associate Executive Director for Engineering Sciences, an Associate Executive Director for Epidemiology, an Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Administrative Litigation, an Associate Executive Director for Health Sciences, an Associate Executive Director for Economic Analysis, an Associate Executive Director for Administration, an Associate Executive Director for Field Operations, a Director for Office of Program, Management, and Budget, and a Director for Office of Information and Public Affairs. Any other individual appointed to a position designated as an Associate Executive Director shall be appointed by the Chairman, subject to the approval of the Commission. The Chairman may only appoint an attorney to the position of Associate Executive Director of Compliance and Administrative Litigation except the position of acting Associate Executive Director of Compliance and Administrative Litigation.

            (B)

                (i) No individual may be appointed to such a position on an acting basis for a period longer than 90 days unless such appointment is approved by the Commission.

                (ii) The Chairman, with the approval of the Commission, may remove any individual serving in a position appointed under subparagraph (A).

            (C) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to prohibit appropriate reorganizations or changes in classification.

        (2) The Chairman, subject to subsection (f)(2), may employ such other officers and employees (including attorneys) as are necessary in the execution of the Commission’s functions.

        (3) In addition to the number of positions authorized by [section 5108(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5108/a], the Chairman, subject to the approval of the Commission, and subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by chapter 51 of title 5, may place a total of twelve positions in grades GS–16, GS–17, and GS–18.

        (4) The appointment of any officer (other than a Commissioner) or employee of the Commission shall not be subject, directly or indirectly, to review or approval by any officer or entity within the Executive Office of the President.

        (5) The Chairman may provide to officers and employees of the Commission who are appointed or assigned by the Commission to serve abroad (as defined in section 102 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 ([22 U.S.C. 3902][/us/usc/t22/s3902])) travel benefits similar to those authorized for members of the Foreign Service of the United Service under chapter 9  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of such Act ([22 U.S.C. 4081][/us/usc/t22/s4081] et seq.).

    (h) __Omitted__ 

    (i) __Civil action against United States__ 

    Subsections (a) and (h) of [section 2680 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2680] do not prohibit the bringing of a civil action on a claim against the United States which—

        (1)

         is based upon—

            (A) misrepresentation or deceit on the part of the Commission or any employee thereof, or

            (B) any exercise or performance, or failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function on the part of the Commission or any employee thereof, which exercise, performance, or failure was grossly negligent; and

        (2) is not made with respect to any agency action (as defined in [section 551(13) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s551/13]).

        In the case of a civil action on a claim based upon the exercise or performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function, no judgment may be entered against the United States unless the court in which such action was brought determines (based upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances, including the statutory responsibility of the Commission and the public interest in encouraging rather than inhibiting the exercise of discretion) that such exercise, performance, or failure to exercise or perform was unreasonable.

    (j) __Agenda and priorities; establishment and comments__ 

        At least 30 days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Commission shall establish an agenda for Commission action under the Acts under its jurisdiction and, to the extent feasible, shall establish priorities for such actions. Before establishing such agenda and priorities, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the agenda and priorities and shall provide reasonable opportunity for the submission of comments.
