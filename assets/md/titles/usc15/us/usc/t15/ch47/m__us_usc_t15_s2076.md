## § 2076. Additional functions of Consumer Product Safety Commission

    (a) __Authority to conduct hearings or other inquiries__ 

        The Commission may, by one or more of its members or by such agents or agency as it may designate, conduct any hearing or other inquiry necessary or appropriate to its functions anywhere in the United States. A Commissioner who participates in such a hearing or other inquiry shall not be disqualified solely by reason of such participation from subsequently participating in a decision of the Commission in the same manner. The Commission shall publish notice of any proposed hearing in the Federal Register and shall afford a reasonable opportunity for interested persons to present relevant testimony and data.

    (b) __Commission powers; orders__ 

    The Commission shall also have the power—

        (1) to require, by special or general orders, any person to submit in writing such reports and answers to questions as the Commission may prescribe to carry out a specific regulatory or enforcement function of the Commission; and such submission shall be made within such reasonable period and under oath or otherwise as the Commission may determine;

        (2) to administer oaths;

        (3) to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all documentary and physical evidence relating to the execution of its duties;

        (4) in any proceeding or investigation to order testimony to be taken by deposition before any person who is designated by the Commission and has the power to administer oaths and, in such instances, to compel testimony and the production of evidence in the same manner as authorized under paragraph (3) of this subsection;

        (5) to pay witnesses the same fees and mileage as are paid in like circumstances in the courts of the United States;

        (6) to accept gifts and voluntary and uncompensated services, notwithstanding the provisions of [section 1342 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1342];

        (7)

         to—

            (A) initiate, prosecute, defend, or appeal (other than to the Supreme Court of the United States), through its own legal representative and in the name of the Commission, any civil action if the Commission makes a written request to the Attorney General for representation in such civil action and the Attorney General does not within the 45-day period beginning on the date such request was made notify the Commission in writing that the Attorney General will represent the Commission in such civil action, and

            (B) initiate, prosecute, or appeal, through its own legal representative, with the concurrence of the Attorney General or through the Attorney General, any criminal action,

            for the purpose of enforcing the laws subject to its jurisdiction;

        (9) to delegate to the general counsel of the Commission the authority to issue subpoenas solely to Federal, State, or local government agencies for evidence described in paragraph (3); and

        (10) to delegate any of its functions or powers, other than the power to issue subpenas under paragraph (3) (except as provided in paragraph (9)), to any officer or employee of the Commission.

        An order issued under paragraph (1) shall contain a complete statement of the reason the Commission requires the report or answers specified in the order to carry out a specific regulatory or enforcement function of the Commission. Such an order shall be designed to place the least burden on the person subject to the order as is practicable taking into account the purpose for which the order was issued.

    (c) __Noncompliance with subpena or Commission order; contempt__ 

        Any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is carried on, may, upon petition by the Commission (subject to subsection (b)(7)) or by the Attorney General, in case of refusal to obey a subpena or order of the Commission issued under subsection (b) of this section, issue an order requiring compliance therewith; and any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.

    (d) __Disclosure of information__ 

        No person shall be subject to civil liability to any person (other than the Commission or the United States) for disclosing information at the request of the Commission.

    (e) __Performance and technical data__ 

        The Commission may by rule require any manufacturer of consumer products to provide to the Commission such performance and technical data related to performance and safety as may be required to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and to give such notification of such performance and technical data at the time of original purchase to prospective purchasers and to the first purchaser of such product for purposes other than resale, as it determines necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
