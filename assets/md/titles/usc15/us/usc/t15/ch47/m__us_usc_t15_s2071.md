        (3) Restrain any person from distributing in commerce a product which does not comply with a consumer product safety rule.

        Such actions may be brought by the Commission (without regard to [section 2076(b)(7)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2076/b/7/A]) or by the Attorney General in any United States district court for a district wherein any act, omission, or transaction constituting the violation occurred, or in such court for the district wherein the defendant is found or transacts business. In any action under this section process may be served on a defendant in any other district in which the defendant resides or may be found.

    (b) __Products liable to proceeding__ 

    Any consumer product—

        (1) which fails to conform with an applicable consumer product safety rule, or

        (2) the manufacture for sale, offering for sale, distribution in commerce, or the importation into the United States of which has been prohibited by an order in effect under [section 2064(d) of this title][/us/usc/t15/s2064/d],

        when introduced into or while in commerce or while held for sale after shipment in commerce shall be liable to be proceeded against on libel of information and condemned in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such consumer product is found.
