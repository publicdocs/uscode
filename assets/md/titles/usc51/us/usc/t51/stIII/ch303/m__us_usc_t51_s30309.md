        (1) Abandoned or underutilized buildings, grounds, and facilities in depressed communities that can be converted to Administration usage at a reasonable cost, as determined by the Administrator.

        (2) Any military installation that is closed or being closed, or any facility at such an installation.

        (3)

         Any other facility or part of a facility that the Administrator determines to be—

            (A) owned or leased by the United States for the use of another agency of the Federal Government; and

            (B)

             considered by the head of the agency involved to be—
