    The Administrator shall establish such security requirements, restrictions, and safeguards as the Administrator deems necessary in the interest of the national security. The Administrator may arrange with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for the conduct of such security or other personnel investigations of the Administration’s officers, employees, and consultants, and its contractors and subcontractors and their officers and employees, actual or prospective, as the Administrator deems appropriate. If any such investigation develops any data reflecting that the individual who is the subject of the investigation is of questionable loyalty, the matter shall be referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the conduct of a full field investigation, the results of which shall be furnished to the Administrator.

    The words “Director of the Office of Personnel Management” are substituted for “Civil Service Commission” because of section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 (5 App U.S.C.).
