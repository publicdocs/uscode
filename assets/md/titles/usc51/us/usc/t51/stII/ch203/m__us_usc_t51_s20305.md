## § 20305. National Academies decadal surveys

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator shall enter into agreements on a periodic basis with the National Academies for independent assessments, also known as decadal surveys, to take stock of the status and opportunities for Earth and space science discipline fields and Aeronautics research and to recommend priorities for research and programmatic areas over the next decade.

    (b)  __Independent Cost Estimates__  __.—__ 

    The agreements described in subsection (a) shall include independent estimates of the life cycle costs and technical readiness of missions assessed in the decadal surveys whenever possible.

    (c)  __Reexamination__  __.—__ 

    The Administrator shall request that each National Academies decadal survey committee identify any conditions or events, such as significant cost growth or scientific or technological advances, that would warrant the Administration asking the National Academies to reexamine the priorities that the decadal survey had established.

 __Implementation of Decadal Survey’s Recommended Decision Rules__ 

[Pub. L. 112–55, div. B, title III][/us/pl/112/55], Nov. 18, 2011, [125 Stat. 622][/us/stat/125/622], provided in part: 

> “That NASA shall implement the recommendations of the most recent National Research Council planetary decadal survey and shall follow the decadal survey’s recommended decision rules regarding program implementation, including a strict adherence to the recommendation that NASA include in a balanced program a flagship class mission, which may be executed in cooperation with one or more international partners, if such mission can be appropriately de-scoped and all NASA costs for such mission can be accommodated within the overall funding levels appropriated by Congress”.
