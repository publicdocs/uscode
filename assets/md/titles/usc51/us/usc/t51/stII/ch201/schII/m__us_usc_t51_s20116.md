    In subsections (a)(2) and (b), the words “section 102(c) of this Act”, which appear in [section 206 of Public Law 85–568][/us/pl/85/568/s206] ([72 Stat. 432][/us/stat/72/432]), are treated as referring to section 102(d), rather than section 102(c), of [Public Law 85–568][/us/pl/85/568] because of the redesignation done by section 110(a)(2) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1985 ([Public Law 98–361][/us/pl/98/361], [98 Stat. 426][/us/stat/98/426]).
