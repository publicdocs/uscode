 __George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey__ 

[Pub. L. 109–155, title III, § 321][/us/pl/109/155/s321], Dec. 30, 2005, [119 Stat. 2922][/us/stat/119/2922], provided that:

>     “(a) __Short Title.—__ 

>     This section may be cited as the ‘George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act’.

>     “(b) __Findings.—__ 

>     The Congress makes the following findings:

>         “(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth’s species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.

>         “(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth’s atmosphere several times in the Earth’s history and pose a similar threat in the future.

>         “(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects’ closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.

>         “(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA \[National Aeronautics and Space Administration\] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.

>     “(c) __Definitions.—__ 

>     For purposes of this section the term ‘near-Earth object’ means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.

>     “(d) __Near-Earth Object Survey.—__ 

>         “(1) __Survey program.—__ 

>         The Administrator \[of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\] shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act \[Dec. 30, 2005\].

>         “(2) __\[Amended former__  __[__  __section 2451 of Title 42__  __][/us/usc/t42/s2451]__  __, The Public Health and Welfare.\]__ 

>         “(3) __Fifth-year report.—__ 

>         The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:

>             “(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.

>             “(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.

>         “(4) __Initial report.—__ 

>         The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following:

>             “(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.

>             “(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.

>             “(C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with Earth.”
