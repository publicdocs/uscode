## § 71101. Reaffirmation of policy

    Congress reaffirms the policy set forth in [section 20102(g) of this title][/us/usc/t51/s20102/g] (relating to surveying near-Earth asteroids and comets).

([Pub. L. 111–314, § 3][/us/pl/111/314/s3], Dec. 18, 2010, [124 Stat. 3439][/us/stat/124/3439].)

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 110–422, title VIII, § 802][/us/pl/110/422/s802], Oct. 15, 2008, [122 Stat. 4803][/us/stat/122/4803], provided that: 

> “Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth’s species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.

>     “(2) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects’ closest approach to Earth and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.

>     “(3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most costly natural disasters that can occur.

>     “(4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with Earth is measured in decades.

>     “(5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety structure.

>     “(6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.

>     “(7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.”
