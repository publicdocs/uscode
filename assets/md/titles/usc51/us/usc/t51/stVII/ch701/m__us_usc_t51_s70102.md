## § 70102. Space shuttle use policy

    (a) __Use Policy.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

            (A)  __Policy__  __.—__ 

            It shall be the policy of the United States to use the space shuttle—

                (i) for purposes that require a human presence;

                (ii) for purposes that require the unique capabilities of the space shuttle; or

                (iii) when other compelling circumstances exist.

            (B)  __Definition of compelling circumstances__  __.—__ 

            In this paragraph, the term “compelling circumstances” includes, but is not limited to, occasions when the Administrator determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that important national security or foreign policy interests would be served by a shuttle launch.

        (2)  __Using available cargo space for secondary payloads__  __.—__ 

        The policy stated in paragraph (1) shall not preclude the use of available cargo space, on a space shuttle mission otherwise consistent with the policy described in paragraph (1), for the purpose of carrying secondary payloads (as defined by the Administrator) that do not require a human presence if such payloads are consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.

    (b)  __Annual Report__  __.—__ 

    At least annually, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report certifying that the payloads scheduled to be launched on the space shuttle for the next 4 years are consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (a)(1). For each payload scheduled to be launched from the space shuttle that does not require a human presence, the Administrator shall, in the certified report to Congress, state the specific circumstances that justified the use of the space shuttle. If, during the period between scheduled reports to Congress, any additions are made to the list of certified payloads intended to be launched from the shuttle, the Administrator shall inform Congress of the additions and the reasons therefor within 45 days of the change.

    (c)  __Administration Payloads__  __.—__ 

    The report described in subsection (b) shall also include those Administration payloads designed solely to fly on the space shuttle which have begun the phase C/D of its development cycle.
