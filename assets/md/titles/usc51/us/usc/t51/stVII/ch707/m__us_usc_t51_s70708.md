    In subsection (a), the words “at a rate not to exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate” for “at not to exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate” for consistency in title 51.

    In subsection (b), the words “[section 5703 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5703]” are substituted for “[section 5703(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5703/b]” to correct an error in the law. [Section 5703 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5703], United States Code, does not contain a subsection (b).
