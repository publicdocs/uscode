## § 40301. Purposes

The purposes of this chapter are to—

    (1) increase the understanding, assessment, development, and utilization of space resources by promoting a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques;

    (2) utilize the abilities and talents of the universities of the Nation to support and contribute to the exploration and development of the resources and opportunities afforded by the space environment;

    (3)

     encourage and support, within the university community of the Nation, the existence of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary programs of space research that—

        (A) engage in integrated activities of training, research, and public service;

        (B) have cooperative programs with industry; and

        (C) are coordinated with the overall program of the Administration;

    (4) encourage and support the existence of consortia, made up of university and industry members, in order to advance the exploration and development of space resources in cases in which national objectives can be better fulfilled through such consortia than through the programs of single universities;

    (5) encourage and support Federal funding for graduate fellowships in fields related to space; and

    (6) support activities in colleges and universities generally for the purpose of creating and operating a network of institutional programs that will enhance achievements resulting from efforts under this chapter.

 __Congressional Statement of Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 100–147, title II, § 202][/us/pl/100/147/s202], Oct. 30, 1987, [101 Stat. 869][/us/stat/101/869], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1) the vitality of the Nation and the quality of life of the citizens of the Nation depend increasingly on the understanding, assessment, development, and utilization of space resources;

>     “(2) research and development of space science, space technology, and space commercialization will contribute to the quality of life, national security, and the enhancement of commerce;

>     “(3) the understanding and development of the space frontiers require a broad commitment and an intense involvement on the part of the Federal Government in partnership with State and local governments, private industry, universities, organizations, and individuals concerned with the exploration and utilization of space;

>     “(4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, through the national space grant college and fellowship program, offers the most suitable means for such commitment and involvement through the promotion of activities that will result in greater understanding, assessment, development, and utilization; and

>     “(5) Federal support of the establishment, development, and operation of programs and projects by space grant colleges, space grant regional consortia, institutions of higher education, institutes, laboratories, and other appropriate public and private entities is the most cost-effective way to promote such activities.”
