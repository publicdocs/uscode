    (2) __Energy consumption.—__ 

    Twenty-five percent reduction in the energy required for medium- to long-range flights, compared to aircraft in commercial service as of December 30, 2005.

    (3) __Emissions.—__ 

    Nitrogen oxides on take-off and landing that are significantly reduced, without adversely affecting hydrocarbons and smoke, relative to aircraft in commercial service as of December 30, 2005.
