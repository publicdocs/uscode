> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1) the space program can make significant contributions to selected areas of health-related research and should be an integral part of the Nation’s health research and development program;

>     “(2) the continuing development of trained scientists and engineers is essential to carrying out an effective and sustained program of biomedical research in space and on the ground;

>     “(3) the establishment and maintenance of an electronically accessible archive of data on space-related biomedical research is essential to advancement of the field;

>     “(4) cooperation with the republics of the former Soviet Union, including use of former Soviet orbital facilities, offers the potential for greatly enhanced biomedical research activities and progress; and

>     “(5) the establishment and maintenance of an international telemedicine consultation satellite capability to support emergency medical service provision can provide an important aid to disaster relief efforts.”
