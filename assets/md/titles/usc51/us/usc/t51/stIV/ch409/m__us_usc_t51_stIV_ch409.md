>     “(a) __Sense of Congress.—__ 

>     It is the sense of Congress that NASA \[National Aeronautics and Space Administration\] is uniquely positioned to interest students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, not only by the example it sets, but through its education programs.

>     “(b) __Educational Program Goals.—__ 

>     NASA shall develop and maintain educational programs—

>         “(1) to carry out and support research based programs and activities designed to increase student interest and participation in STEM, including students from minority and underrepresented groups;

>         “(2) to improve public literacy in STEM;

>         “(3) that employ proven strategies and methods for improving student learning and teaching in STEM;

>         “(4)

>          to provide curriculum support materials and other resources that—

>             “(A) are designed to be integrated with comprehensive STEM education;

>             “(B) are aligned with national science education standards;

>             “(C) promote the adoption and implementation of high-quality education practices that build toward college and career-readiness; and

>         “(5) to create and support opportunities for enhanced and ongoing professional development for teachers using best practices that improve the STEM content and knowledge of the teachers, including through programs linking STEM teachers with STEM educators at the higher education level.”

    \[For definition of “STEM” as used in [section 202 of Pub. L. 111–358][/us/pl/111/358/s202], set out above, see [section 2 of Pub. L. 111–358][/us/pl/111/358/s2], set out as a note under [section 6621 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s6621], The Public Health and Welfare.\]

>     “(a) __National Awareness Campaign.—__ 

>         “(1) __In general.—__ 

>         The Administrator \[of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\] shall implement, beginning not later than May 1, 2006, a national awareness campaign through various media, including print, radio, television, and the Internet, to articulate missions, publicize recent accomplishments, and facilitate efforts to encourage young Americans to enter the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering to help maintain United States leadership in those fields.

>         “(2) __Reports.—__ 

>             (A) Not later than April 1, 2006, the Administrator shall transmit a plan to the Committee on Science \[now Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate describing the activities that will be undertaken as part of the national awareness campaign required by paragraph (1) and the expected cost of those activities. NASA \[National Aeronautics and Space Administration\] may undertake activities as part of the national awareness campaign prior to the transmittal of the plan required by this subparagraph, but the plan shall include a description of any activities undertaken prior to the transmittal and the estimated cost of those activities.

>             “(B) Not later than three years after the date of enactment of this Act \[Dec. 30, 2005\], the Administrator shall transmit to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate an assessment of the impact of the national awareness campaign.

>     “(b) __Budget Information.—__ 

>     Not later than April 30, 2006, the Administrator shall transmit to the Committee on Science \[now Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report describing—

>         “(1) the expected cost of the Crew Exploration Vehicle through fiscal year 2020, based on the public specifications for that development contract; and

>             “(A) first assuming inflationary growth for the budget of NASA as a whole and including costs for the Crew Exploration Vehicle as projected under paragraph (1); and

>             “(B) then assuming inflationary growth for the budget of NASA as a whole and including at least two cost estimates for the Crew Exploration Vehicle that are higher than those projected under paragraph (1), based on NASA’s past experience with cost increases for similar programs, along with a description of the reasons for selecting the cost estimates used for the calculations under this subparagraph and the confidence level for each of the cost estimates used in this section.

>     “(c) __Space Communications Plan.—__ 

>         “(1) __Plan.—__ 

>         The Administrator shall develop a plan, in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, for updating NASA’s space communications architecture for both low-Earth orbital operations and deep space exploration so that it is capable of meeting NASA’s needs over the next 20 years. The plan shall include life-cycle cost estimates, milestones, estimated performance capabilities, and 5-year funding profiles. The plan shall also include an estimate of the amounts of any reimbursements NASA is likely to receive from other Federal agencies during the expected life of the upgrades described in the plan. At a minimum, the plan shall include a description of the following:

>             “(A) Projected Deep Space Network requirements for the next 20 years, including those in support of human space exploration missions.

>             “(B) Upgrades needed to support Deep Space Network requirements.

>             “(C) Cost estimates for the maintenance of existing Deep Space Network capabilities.
