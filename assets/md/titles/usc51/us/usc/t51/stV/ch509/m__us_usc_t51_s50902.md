In subclause (C), the words “in regulations” and “in such entity” are omitted as surplus.

    In clause (6), the words “includes all . . . located on a launch site which are . . . to conduct a launch” are omitted as surplus.

    In clause (9), the words “corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or other” are omitted as surplus.

    Clauses (10) and (12) are substituted for 49 App.:2603(10) to eliminate unnecessary words.
