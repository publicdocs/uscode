 __[__  __Pub. L. 104–287__  __][/us/pl/104/287]__ 

    This amends 49:70117(b)(2) by updating a cross-reference.

The substantive provisions of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, which replaced the Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984, were classified to the United States Code at [15 U.S.C. 5601][/us/usc/t15/s5601] et seq.
