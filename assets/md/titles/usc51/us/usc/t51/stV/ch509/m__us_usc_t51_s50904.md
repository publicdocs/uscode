## § 50904. Restrictions on launches, operations, and reentries

    (a)  __Requirement__  __.—__ 

    A license issued or transferred under this chapter, or a permit, is required for the following:

        (1) for a person to launch a launch vehicle or to operate a launch site or reentry site, or to reenter a reentry vehicle, in the United States.

        (2) for a citizen of the United States (as defined in section 50902(1)(A) or (B) of this title) to launch a launch vehicle or to operate a launch site or reentry site, or to reenter a reentry vehicle, outside the United States.

        (3) for a citizen of the United States (as defined in [section 50902(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t51/s50902/1/C]) to launch a launch vehicle or to operate a launch site or reentry site, or to reenter a reentry vehicle, outside the United States and outside the territory of a foreign country unless there is an agreement between the United States Government and the government of the foreign country providing that the government of the foreign country has jurisdiction over the launch or operation or reentry.

        (4) for a citizen of the United States (as defined in [section 50902(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t51/s50902/1/C]) to launch a launch vehicle or to operate a launch site or reentry site, or to reenter a reentry vehicle, in the territory of a foreign country if there is an agreement between the United States Government and the government of the foreign country providing that the United States Government has jurisdiction over the launch or operation or reentry.

        Notwithstanding this subsection, a permit shall not authorize a person to operate a launch site or reentry site.

    (b)  __Compliance With Payload Requirements__  __.—__ 

    The holder of a license or permit under this chapter may launch or reenter a payload only if the payload complies with all requirements of the laws of the United States related to launching or reentering a payload.

    (c)  __Preventing Launches and Reentries__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall establish whether all required licenses, authorizations, and permits required for a payload have been obtained. If no license, authorization, or permit is required, the Secretary may prevent the launch or reentry if the Secretary decides the launch or reentry would jeopardize the public health and safety, safety of property, or national security or foreign policy interest of the United States.

    (d)  __Single License or Permit__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that only 1 license or permit is required from the Department of Transportation to conduct activities involving crew or space flight participants, including launch and reentry, for which a license or permit is required under this chapter. The Secretary shall ensure that all Department of Transportation regulations relevant to the licensed or permitted activity are satisfied.

In subsection (a)(2)–(4), the cross-reference is to section 70102(1) of the revised title (restating 49 App.:2603(12)) rather than to section 70102(11) (restating 49 App.:2603(11)) to correct a mistake. Section 3(2) of the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 ([Public Law 100–657][/us/pl/100/657], [102 Stat. 3900][/us/stat/102/3900]) redesignated 49 App.:2603(11) as 49 App.:2603(12) but did not amend the cross-reference in 49 App.:2605(a).

    In subsection (a)(3) and (4), the words “the government of” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “in force” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “at any place which is both” are omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (a)(4), the text of 49 App.:2605(a)(3)(B)(i) is omitted as surplus.

    In subsection (c), the words “by Federal law”, “which is to be launched”, “by any Federal law”, “take such action under this chapter as the Secretary deems necessary to”, and “of a payload by a holder of a launch license under this chapter” are omitted as surplus.
