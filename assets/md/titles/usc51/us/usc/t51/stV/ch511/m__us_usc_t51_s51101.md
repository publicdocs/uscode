    Clause (1) is added to incorporate the definitions in 15:5802.

    In clause (2), the word “includes” is substituted for “may include” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In clause (5), the words “municipality or other” are omitted for consistency.

    The text of 15:5804(5) is omitted as unnecessary because the complete name of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section.
