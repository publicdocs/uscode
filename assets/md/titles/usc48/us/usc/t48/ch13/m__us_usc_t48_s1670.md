([Pub. L. 98–454, title II, § 202][/us/pl/98/454/s202], Oct. 5, 1984, [98 Stat. 1733][/us/stat/98/1733]; [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095]; [Pub. L. 108–326, § 1(a)][/us/pl/108/326/s1/a], Oct. 16, 2004, [118 Stat. 1270][/us/stat/118/1270].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 103, referred to in subsec. (a), which related to interest on certain governmental obligations was amended generally by [Pub. L. 99–514, title XIII, § 1301(a)][/us/pl/99/514/s1301/a], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2602][/us/stat/100/2602], and as so amended relates to interest on State and local bonds. Section 103(b)(2), which prior to the general amendment defined industrial development bond, relates to the applicability of the interest exclusion to arbitrage bonds.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 108–326][/us/pl/108/326] amended heading and text generally, substituting provisions relating to exemption of all bonds from income taxation by State and local governments for provisions relating to exemption from taxation and definition of State.

    1986—Subsecs. (a), (c). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

 __Effective Date of 2004 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 108–326, § 2][/us/pl/108/326/s2], Oct. 16, 2004, [118 Stat. 1270][/us/stat/118/1270], provided that: 

> “This Act \[amending this section\] shall apply to obligations issued after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Oct. 16, 2004\].”
