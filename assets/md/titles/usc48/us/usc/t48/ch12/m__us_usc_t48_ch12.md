> “Sec. 5.

>  \[Transmittal to Congress and submittal to voters\] (a) Within sixty calendar days after the respective date on which he has received each constitution, the President shall transmit such constitution together with his comments to the Congress.

>     “(b) The constitution, in each case, shall be deemed to have been approved by the Congress within 60 legislative days after its submission by the President, unless prior to that date the Congress has approved the constitution, or modified or amended it, in whole or in part, or has urged the constitutional convention to reconvene, by joint resolution.

>     “(c) __Revision of Proposed Constitution.—__ 

>         “(1) __In general.—__ 

>         If a convention reconvenes and revises the proposed constitution, the convention shall resubmit the revised proposed constitution simultaneously to the Governor of the Virgin Islands and the President.

>         “(2) __Comments of president.—__ 

>         Not later than 60 calendar days after the date of receipt of the revised proposed constitution, the President shall—

>             “(A) notify the convention, the Governor, and Congress of the comments of the President on the revised proposed constitution; and

>             “(B) publish the comments in the Federal Register.

>     “(d) As so approved or modified under subsection (b) (or, if revised pursuant to subsection (c), on publication of the comments of the President in the Federal Register), the constitutions shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the Virgin Islands and Guam, respectively, for acceptance or rejection through islandwide referendums to be conducted as provided under the laws of the Virgin Islands and Guam, respectively, (enacted after the date of enactment of this Act) \[Oct. 21, 1976\].

>     “(e) Upon approval by not less than a majority of the votes (counting only the affirmative or negative votes) participating in such referendums, the constitutions shall become effective in accordance with their terms.”
