 __References in Text__ 

    Act of August 18, 1978, referred to in text, probably means [Pub. L. 95–348][/us/pl/95/348], Aug. 18, 1978, [92 Stat. 487][/us/stat/92/487], as amended, which enacted sections 1645 and 1841 of this title and [section 410dd of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s410dd], Conservation, amended sections 1421h, 1469a, 1575, and 1642 of this title and sections 398a and 398c to 398f of Title 16, and enacted provisions set out as a note under sections 1421, 1641, and 1681 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning [act July 22, 1954, ch. 558][/us/act/1954-07-22/ch558], [68 Stat. 497][/us/stat/68/497], as amended, known as the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, which is classified principally to this chapter.

    Section 3811 of the Internal Revenue Code, referred to in text, means section 3811 of former Title 26, Internal Revenue Code, which was repealed by section 7851(a)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Similar provisions are contained in [section 7651 of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s7651], Internal Revenue Code.
