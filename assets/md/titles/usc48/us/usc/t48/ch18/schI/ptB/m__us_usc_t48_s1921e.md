## § 1921e. Construction contract assistance

    (a) __Assistance to U.S. firms__ 

    In order to assist the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and of the Republic of the Marshall Islands through private sector firms which may be awarded contracts for construction or major repair of capital infrastructure within the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the United States shall consult with the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands with respect to any such contracts, and the United States shall enter into agreements with such firms whereby such firms will, consistent with applicable requirements of such Governments—

        (1) to the maximum extent possible, employ citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands;

        (2) to the extent that necessary skills are not possessed by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, provide on the job training, with particular emphasis on the development of skills relating to operation of machinery and routine and preventative maintenance of machinery and other facilities; and

        (3) provide specific training or other assistance in order to enable the Government to engage in long-term maintenance of infrastructure.

        Assistance by such firms pursuant to this section may not exceed 20 percent of the amount of the contract and shall be made available only to such firms which meet the definition of United States firm under the nationality rule for suppliers of services of the Agency for International Development (hereafter in this section referred to as “United States firms”). There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of this subsection.

    (b) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to cover any additional costs incurred by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands if such Governments, pursuant to an agreement entered into with the United States, apply a preference on the award of contracts to United States firms, provided that the amount of such preference does not exceed 10 percent of the amount of the lowest qualified bid from a non-United States firm for such contract.
