 __References in Text__ 

    The Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), is title II of [Pub. L. 91–513][/us/pl/91/513], Oct. 27, 1970, [84 Stat. 1242][/us/stat/84/1242], as amended. Part C of the Act is classified generally to part C (§ 821 et seq.) of subchapter I of chapter 13 of Title 21, Food and Drugs. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 801 of Title 21][/us/usc/t21/s801] and Tables.

    [Section 953 of title 21][/us/usc/t21/s953], referred to in subsec. (a)(2), was in the original “section 1003 of the Controlled Substances Act”, and was translated as reading “section 1003 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act”, meaning [section 1003 of title III of Pub. L. 91–513][/us/pl/91/513/tIII/s1003], to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
