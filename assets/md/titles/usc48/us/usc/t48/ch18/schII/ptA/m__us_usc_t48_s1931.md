 __Proc. No. 6726. Placing Into Full Force and Effect Compact of Free Association With Republic of Palau__ 

    Proc. No. 6726, Sept. 27, 1994, 59 F.R. 49777, provided:

    Since July 18, 1947, the United States has administered the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (“Trust Territory”), which has included the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

    On November 3, 1986, a Covenant between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands \[[48 U.S.C. 1801][/us/usc/t48/s1801] note\] came into force. This Covenant established the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as a self-governing Commonwealth in political union with and under the sovereignty of the United States.

    On October 21, 1986, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and on November 3, 1986, in the case of the Federated States of Micronesia, Compacts of Free Association with the United States \[[48 U.S.C. 1901][/us/usc/t48/s1901] note\] became effective. Under the Compacts, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands became self-governing sovereign states, in free association with the United States. Following the changes in political status of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Trusteeship Agreement ceased to be applicable to those entities and only Palau remained as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

    On January 10, 1986, the Government of the United States and the Government of Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association \[set out above\] similar to those that the United States entered into with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and with the Federated States of Micronesia. As in those instances, it was specified that the Compact with Palau would come into effect upon (1) mutual agreement between the Government of the United States, acting in fulfillment of its responsibilities as Administering Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Government of Palau; (2) the approval of the Compact by the two Governments, in accordance with their constitutional processes; and (3) the approval of the Compact by plebiscite in Palau.

    In Palau the Compact has been approved by the Government in accordance with its constitutional processes and by a United Nations-observed plebiscite on November 9, 1993, a sovereign act of self-determination. In the United States the Compact was approved by [Public Law 99–658][/us/pl/99/658] of November 14, 1986 \[[48 U.S.C. 1931][/us/usc/t48/s1931] et seq.\], and [Public Law 101–219][/us/pl/101/219] of December 12, 1989 \[[48 U.S.C. 1951][/us/usc/t48/s1951] et seq.\].

    On May 25, 1994, the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations concluded that the Government of the United States had satisfactorily discharged its obligations as the Administering Authority under the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the people of Palau had freely exercised their right to self-determination and considered that it was appropriate for the Trusteeship Agreement to be terminated. The Council asked the United States to consult with the Government of Palau and to agree on a date, on or about October 1, 1994, for entry into force of their new status agreement.

    On July 15, 1994, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Palau agreed, pursuant to section 411 of the Compact of Free Association, that as between the United States and the Republic of Palau, the effective date of the Compact shall be October 1, 1994.

    As of this day, September 27, 1994, the United States has fulfilled its obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement with respect to the Republic of Palau. On October 1, 1994, the Compact will enter into force between the United States and the Republic of Palau, and Palau will thereafter be self-governing and no longer subject to the Trusteeship. In taking these actions, the United States is implementing the freely expressed wishes of the people of Palau.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including sections 101 and 102 of the Joint Resolution to approve the “Compact of Free Association” between the United States and the Government of Palau, and for other purposes, approved on November 14, 1986 ([Public Law 99–658][/us/pl/99/658]) \[[48 U.S.C. 1931][/us/usc/t48/s1931], 1932\], and section 101 of the Joint Resolution to authorize entry into force of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Government of Palau, and for other purposes, approved on December 12, 1989 ([Public Law 101–219][/us/pl/101/219]) \[[48 U.S.C. 1951][/us/usc/t48/s1951]\], and pursuant to section 1002 of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America \[[48 U.S.C. 1801][/us/usc/t48/s1801] note\], and consistent with sections 101 and 102 of the Joint Resolution to approve the “Compact of Free Association” and for other purposes, approved on January 14, 1986 ([Public Law 99–239][/us/pl/99/239]) \[[48 U.S.C. 1901][/us/usc/t48/s1901], 1902\], do hereby find, declare, and proclaim as follows:

    Section 1. I determine that the Trusteeship Agreement for the Pacific Islands will be no longer in effect with respect to the Republic of Palau as of October 1, 1994, at one minute past one o’clock p.m. local time in Palau. This constitutes the determination referred to in section 1002 of the Covenant with the Northern Mariana Islands ([Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241]).

    Sec. 2. The Compact of Free Association with the Republic of Palau will be in full force and effect as of October 1, 1994, at one minute past one o’clock p.m. local time in Palau.

    Sec. 3. I am gratified that the people of the Republic of Palau, after 47 years of Trusteeship, have freely chosen to establish a relationship of Free Association with the United States.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

                              William J. Clinton.
