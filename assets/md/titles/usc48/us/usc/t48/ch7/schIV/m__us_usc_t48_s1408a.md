## § 1408a. Issuance of notes, bonds, and obligations

    The legislative assembly may authorize such authority, any provision of the Virgin Islands Organic Act \[[48 U.S.C. 1405][/us/usc/t48/s1405] et seq.\] or any other Act of Congress to the contrary notwithstanding, to borrow money and to issue notes, bonds, and other obligations of such character and maturity, with such security, and in such manner as the legislative assembly may provide. Such notes, bonds, and other obligations shall not be a debt of the United States, or of the Virgin Islands or of any municipality or subdivision thereof, other than such authority, nor constitute “bonds and other obligations” within the meaning of sections 1403 to 1403b of this title, or a debt, indebtedness, or the borrowing of money within the meaning of any limitation or restriction on the issuance of notes, bonds, or other obligations contained in any laws of the United States applicable to the Virgin Islands or to any municipal corporation or other political subdivision or agency thereof.
