## § 2176. Compensation of professionals

    (a) __Compensation for services rendered and reimbursement for expenses__ 

    After notice to the parties in interest and the United States Trustee and a hearing, the court may award to a professional person employed by the debtor (in the debtor’s sole discretion), the Oversight Board (in the Oversight Board’s sole discretion), a committee under [section 1103 of title 11][/us/usc/t11/s1103], or a trustee appointed by the court under [section 926 of title 11][/us/usc/t11/s926]—

        (1) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the professional person, or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person; and

        (2) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.

    (b) __Award of compensation less than amount requested__ 

        The court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the United States Trustee or any other party in interest, award compensation that is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.

    (c) __Factors considered__ 

    In determining the amount of reasonable compensation to be awarded to a professional person, the court shall consider the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, taking into account all relevant factors, including—

        (1) the time spent on such services;

        (2) the rates charged for such services;

        (3) whether the services were necessary to the administration of, or beneficial at the time at which the service was rendered toward the completion of, a case under this chapter;  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (4) whether the services were performed within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity, importance, and nature of the problem, issue, or task addressed;

        (5) with respect to a professional person, whether the person is board certified or otherwise has demonstrated skill and experience in the restructuring field; and

        (6) whether the compensation is reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by comparably skilled practitioners in cases other than cases under this subchapter or title 11.

    (d) __Services ineligible for compensation__ 

    The court shall not allow compensation for—

        (1) unnecessary duplication of services; or

        (2)

         services that were not—

            (A) reasonably likely to benefit the debtor; or

            (B) necessary to the administration of the case.

    (e) __Offset for interim compensation under__  __[__  __section 2177 of this title__  __][/us/usc/t48/s2177]__ 

        The court shall reduce the amount of compensation awarded under this section by the amount of any interim compensation awarded under [section 2177 of this title][/us/usc/t48/s2177], and, if the amount of such interim compensation exceeds the amount of compensation awarded under this section, may order the return of the excess to the debtor.

    (f) __Compensation for preparation of fee application__ 

        Any compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.
