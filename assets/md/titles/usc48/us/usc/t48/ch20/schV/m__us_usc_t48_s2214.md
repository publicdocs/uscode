## § 2214. Miscellaneous provisions

    (a) __Creation of Interagency Environmental Subcommittee__ 

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Revitalization Coordinator is appointed, the Interagency Environmental Subcommittee shall be established and shall evaluate environmental documents required under Puerto Rico law for any Critical Project within the Expedited Permitting Process established by the Revitalization Coordinator under [section 2213(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t48/s2213/a/3].

        (2) __Composition__ 

            The Interagency Environmental Subcommittee shall consist of the Revitalization Coordinator, and a representative selected by the Governor in consultation with the Revitalization Coordinator representing each of the following agencies: The Environmental Quality Board, the Planning Board, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, and any other Puerto Rico Agency determined to be relevant by the Revitalization Coordinator.

    (b) __Length of Expedited Permitting Process__ 

        With respect to a Puerto Rico Agency’s activities related only to a Critical Project, such Puerto Rico Agency shall operate as if the Governor has declared an emergency pursuant to section 2 of Act 76 (3 L.P.R.A. 1932). Section 12 of Act 76 (3 L.P.R.A. 1942) shall not be applicable to Critical Projects. Furthermore, any transactions, processes, projects, works, or programs essential to the completion of a Critical Project shall continue to be processed and completed under such Expedited Permitting Process regardless of the termination of the Oversight Board under [section 2149 of this title][/us/usc/t48/s2149].

    (c) __Expedited Permitting Process compliance__ 

        (1) __Written notice__ 

            A Critical Project Sponsor may in writing notify the Oversight Board of the failure of a Puerto Rico Agency or the Revitalization Coordinator to adhere to the Expedited Permitting Process.

        (2) __Finding of failure__ 

            If the Oversight Board finds either the Puerto Rico Agency or Revitalization Coordinator has failed to adhere to the Expedited Permitting Process, the Oversight Board shall direct the offending party to comply with the Expedited Permitting Process. The Oversight Board may take such enforcement action as necessary as provided by section 2124(l) of this title.

    (d) __Review of Legislature acts__ 

        (1) __Submission of acts to Oversight Board__ 

            Pursuant to [section 2144(a) of this title][/us/usc/t48/s2144/a], the Governor shall submit to the Oversight Board any law duly enacted during any fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is in operation that may affect the Expedited Permitting Process.

        (2) __Finding of Oversight Board__ 

            Upon receipt of a law under paragraph (1), the Oversight Board shall promptly review whether the law would adversely impact the Expedited Permitting Process and, upon such a finding, the Oversight Board may deem such law to be significantly inconsistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan.

    (e) __Establishment of certain terms and conditions__ 

        No Puerto Rico Agency may include in any certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization issued for a Critical Project any term or condition that may be permitted, but is not required, by any applicable Puerto Rico law, if the Revitalization Coordinator determines the term or condition would prevent or impair the expeditious construction, operation, or expansion of the Critical Project. The Revitalization Coordinator may request a Puerto Rico Agency to include in any certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization, a term or condition that may be permitted in accordance with applicable laws if the Revitalization Coordinator determines such inclusion would support the expeditious construction, operation, or expansion of any Critical Project.

    (f) __Disclosure__ 

        All Critical Project reports, and justifications for approval or rejection of Critical Project status, shall be made publicly available online within 5 days of receipt or completion.
