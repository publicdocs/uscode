            A Fiscal Plan developed under this section shall cover a period of fiscal years as determined by the Oversight Board in its sole discretion but in any case a period of not less than 5 fiscal years from the fiscal year in which it is certified by the Oversight Board.

    (c) __Development, review, approval, and certification of fiscal plans__ 

        (1) __Timing requirement__ 

            The Governor may not submit to the Legislature a Territory Budget under [section 2142 of this title][/us/usc/t48/s2142] for a fiscal year unless the Oversight Board has certified the Territory Fiscal Plan for that fiscal year in accordance with this subsection, unless the Oversight Board in its sole discretion waives this requirement.

            The Governor shall submit to the Oversight Board any proposed Fiscal Plan required by the Oversight Board by the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a).

        (3) __Review by the Oversight Board__ 

        The Oversight Board shall review any proposed Fiscal Plan to determine whether it satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (b) and, if the Oversight Board determines in its sole discretion that the proposed Fiscal Plan—

            (A) satisfies such requirements, the Oversight Board shall approve the proposed Fiscal Plan; or

            (B)

             does not satisfy such requirements, the Oversight Board shall provide to the Governor—

                (i) a notice of violation that includes recommendations for revisions to the applicable Fiscal Plan; and

                (ii) an opportunity to correct the violation in accordance with subsection (d)(1).

The Governor may submit as many revised Fiscal Plans to the Oversight Board as the schedule established in the notice delivered under subsection (a) permits.

            If the Governor fails to submit to the Oversight Board a Fiscal Plan that the Oversight Board determines in its sole discretion satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (b) by the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a), the Oversight Board shall develop and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a Fiscal Plan that satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (b).

    (e) __Approval and certification__ 

        (1) __Approval of fiscal plan developed by Governor__ 

            If the Oversight Board approves a Fiscal Plan under subsection (c)(3), it shall deliver a compliance certification for such Fiscal Plan to the Governor and the Legislature.

        (2) __Deemed approval of fiscal plan developed by Oversight Board__ 

            If the Oversight Board develops a Fiscal Plan under subsection (d)(2), such Fiscal Plan shall be deemed approved by the Governor, and the Oversight Board shall issue a compliance certification for such Fiscal Plan to the Governor and the Legislature.

    (f) __Joint development of fiscal plan__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Governor and the Oversight Board jointly develop a Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year that meets the requirements under this section, and that the Governor and the Oversight Board certify that the fiscal plan reflects a consensus between the Governor and the Oversight Board, then such Fiscal Plan shall serve as the Fiscal Plan for the territory or territorial instrumentality for that fiscal year.
