## § 2213. Critical Projects

    (a) __Identification of projects__ 

        (1) __Project submission__ 

        Any Project Sponsor may submit, so long as the Oversight Board is in operation, any existing, ongoing, or proposed project to the Revitalization Coordinator. The Revitalization Coordinator shall require such submission to include—

            (A) the impact the project will have on an emergency;

            (B) the availability of immediate private capital or other funds, including loan guarantees, loans, or grants to implement, operate, or maintain the project;

            (C) the cost of the project and amount of Puerto Rico government funds, if any, necessary to complete and maintain the project;

            (D) the environmental and economic benefits provided by the project, including the number of jobs to be created that will be held by residents of Puerto Rico and the expected economic impact, including the impact on ratepayers, if applicable;

            (E) the status of the project if it is existing or ongoing; and

            (F)

             in addition to the requirements found in subparagraphs (A) through (E), the Revitalization Coordinator may require such submission to include any or all of the following criteria that assess how the project will—

                (i) reduce reliance on oil for electric generation in Puerto Rico;

                (ii) improve performance of energy infrastructure and overall energy efficiency;

                (iii) expedite the diversification and conversion of fuel sources for electric generation from oil to natural gas and renewables in Puerto Rico as defined under applicable Puerto Rico laws;

                (iv) promote the development and utilization of energy sources found on Puerto Rico;

                (v) contribute to transitioning to privatized generation capacities in Puerto Rico;

                (vi) support the Energy Commission of Puerto Rico in achievement of its goal of reducing energy costs and ensuring affordable energy rates for consumers and business; or

                (vii) achieve in whole or in part the recommendations, if feasible, of the study in [section 505(d) of this title][/us/usc/t48/s505/d]  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  to the extent such study is completed and not inconsistent with studies or plans otherwise required under Puerto Rico laws.

        (2) __Identification of relevant Puerto Rico Agencies__ 

            Within 20 days of receiving a project submission under paragraph (1), the Revitalization Coordinator shall, in consultation with the Governor, identify all Puerto Rico Agencies that will have a role in the permitting, approval, authorizing, or other activity related to the development of such project submission.

        (3) __Expedited Permitting Process__ 

            (A) __Submission of Expedited Permitting Process__ 

                Not later than 20 days after receiving a project submission, each Puerto Rico Agency identified in paragraph (1) shall submit to the Revitalization Coordinator the Agency’s Expedited Permitting Process.

            (B) __Failure to provide Expedited Permitting Process__ 

                If a Puerto Rico Agency fails to provide an Expedited Permitting Process within 20 days of receiving a project submission, the Revitalization Coordinator shall consult with the Governor to develop within 20 days an Expedited Permitting Process for the Agency.

            (C) __Implementation and prioritization__ 

                The Revitalization Coordinator shall require Puerto Rico Agencies to implement the Expedited Permitting Process for Critical Projects. Critical Projects shall be prioritized to the maximum extent possible in each Puerto Rico Agency regardless of any agreements transferring or delegating permitting authority to any other Territorial Instrumentality or municipality.

    (b) __Critical Project Report__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For each submitted project, the Revitalization Coordinator in consultation with the Governor and relevant Puerto Rico Agencies identified in subsection (a)(2) shall develop a Critical Project Report within 60 days of the project submission, which shall include:

            (A) An assessment of how well the project meets the criteria in subsection (a)(1).

            (B) A recommendation by the Governor whether the project should be considered a Critical Project. If the Governor fails to provide a recommendation during the development of the Critical Project Report, the failure shall constitute a concurrence with the Revitalization Coordinator’s recommendation in subparagraph (E).

            (C) In the case of a project that may affect the implementation of Land-Use Plans, as defined by Puerto Rico Act 550–2004, a determination by the Planning Board will be required within the 60-day timeframe. If the Planning Board determines such project will be inconsistent with relevant Land-Use Plans, then the project will be deemed ineligible for Critical Project designation.

            (D) In the case of an Energy Project that will connect with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s transmission or distribution facilities, a recommendation by the Energy Commission of Puerto Rico, if the Energy Commission determines such Energy Project will affect an approved Integrated Resource Plan, as defined under Puerto Rico Act 54–2014. If the Energy Commission determines the Energy Project will adversely affect an approved Integrated Resource Plan, then the Energy Commission shall provide the reasons for such determination and the Energy Project shall be ineligible for Critical Project designation, provided that such determination must be made during the 60-day timeframe for the development of the Critical Project Report.

            (E) A recommendation by the Revitalization Coordinator whether the project should be considered a Critical Project.

        (2) __Public involvement__ 

            Immediately following the completion of the Critical Project Report, the Revitalization Coordinator shall make such Critical Project Report public and allow a period of 30 days for the submission of comments by residents of Puerto Rico specifically on matters relating to the designation of a project as a Critical Project. The Revitalization Coordinator shall respond to the comments within 30 days of closing the coming  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. </sup></sup>  period and make the responses publicly available.

        (3) __Submission to Oversight Board__ 

            Not later than 5 days after the Revitalization Coordinator has responded to the comments under paragraph (2), the Revitalization Coordinator shall submit the Critical Project Report to the Oversight Board.

    (c) __Action by the Oversight Board__ 

    Not later than 30 days after receiving the Critical Project Report, the Oversight Board, by majority vote, shall approve or disapprove the project as a Critical Project, if the Oversight Board—

        (1) approves the project, the project shall be deemed a Critical Project; and

        (2) disapproves the project, the Oversight Board shall submit to the Revitalization Coordinator in writing the reasons for disapproval.
