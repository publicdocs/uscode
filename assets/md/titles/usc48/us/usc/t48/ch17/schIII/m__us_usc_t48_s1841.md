        There is hereby authorized to be appropriated for expenditure after October 1, 1978, not more than $12,000,000 plus or minus such amounts, if any, as may be justified by reason of ordinary fluctuations in construction costs from October 1978 price levels as indicated by engineering cost indexes applicable to the types of construction involved, to assist in the acquisition and construction of a powerplant for the Northern Mariana Islands together with upgrading, rehabilitation, or replacement of distribution facilities.

    (b) __Services and facilities of Federal agencies; grants-in-aid; availability of appropriations in succeeding fiscal years__

Such amounts may be credited to the appropriation or fund which provided the services and facilities. Agencies and instrumentalities of the Federal Government may, when practicable, make available to the government of the Northern Marianas, upon request of the Secretary, such services and facilities as they are equipped to render or furnish, and they may do so without reimbursement if otherwise authorized by law.

        (2) Any funds made available to the Northern Mariana Islands under grant-in-aid programs by section 502 of the Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States of America ([Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241]), or pursuant to any other Act of Congress enacted after March 24, 1976, are hereby authorized to remain available until expended.

        (3) Any amount authorized by the Covenant described in paragraph (2) or by any other Act of Congress enacted after March 24, 1976, which authorizes appropriations for the Northern Mariana Islands, but not appropriated for a fiscal year is authorized to be available for appropriation in succeeding fiscal years.

The administration and enforcement of such taxes by the government of the Northern Mariana Islands shall begin on January 1 of the year following the year in which such Northern Mariana Islands law is enacted.

        (2) For purposes of carrying out any administration and enforcement required by this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “Secretary”), or his delegate, at no cost to the Northern Marianas government, may (A) employ citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands (as defined by Article III of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States (approved, [Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241]; [90 Stat. 265][/us/stat/90/265]), or (B) use the services of employees of the government of the Northern Mariana Islands, upon agreement to pay such government for the use of such services.
