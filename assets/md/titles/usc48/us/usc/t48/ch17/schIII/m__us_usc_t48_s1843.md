        Except as provided in subsection (c), any person, including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation, which is a resident of or which is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and which is subject to the provisions of section 601 of the Covenant to Establish the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States ([Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241]), shall be exempted from the requirements of such section with respect to income derived from sources within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978, until, but not after, January 1, 1985.

        Except as provided in subsection (c), any person, including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation, which is a resident of or which is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and which is subject to the provisions of section 601 of the Covenant to Establish the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ([Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241]), shall be exempt from the requirements of such section with respect to income from sources within the Northern Mariana Islands for its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1980, and before January 1, 1982: Provided, That the Secretary receives written notice from the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands not later than September 30, 1980, that sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of chapter 2 of [Public Law 1–30][/us/pl/1/30] of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or its successor, have been repealed in their entirety, effective December 31, 1981.

    (c) __Tax rebates__ 

        As provided in section 602  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of [Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241] ([90 Stat. 263][/us/stat/90/263], 270) the term “rebate of any taxes” shall, effective January 1, 1985, apply only to the extent taxes have actually been paid pursuant to section 601  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of said Act, shall not exceed the amount of tax actually paid for any tax year, and may only be paid following the close of the tax year involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective January 1, 1985, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall maintain, as a matter of public record, the name and address of each person receiving such a rebate, together with the amount of the rebate, and the year for which such rebate was made.

([Pub. L. 96–205, title II, § 205][/us/pl/96/205/s205], Mar. 12, 1980, [94 Stat. 87][/us/stat/94/87]; [Pub. L. 96–597, title III, § 303(a)][/us/pl/96/597/s303/a], Dec. 24, 1980, [94 Stat. 3478][/us/stat/94/3478]; [Pub. L. 98–213, § 3(a)][/us/pl/98/213/s3/a], (b), Dec. 8, 1983, [97 Stat. 1459][/us/stat/97/1459].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Covenant, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, which is contained in [section 1 of Pub. L. 94–241][/us/pl/94/241/s1], set out as a note under [section 1801 of this title][/us/usc/t48/s1801].

    [Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241], referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is [Pub. L. 94–241][/us/pl/94/241], Mar. 24, 1976, [90 Stat. 263][/us/stat/90/263], as amended, which is classified generally to subchapter I (§ 1801 et seq.) of this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.

    Sections 601 and 602 of [Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241], referred to in subsec. (c), probably mean sections 601 and 602 of the Covenant, because [Pub. L. 94–241][/us/pl/94/241] does not contain a section 601 or 602.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly set out as a note under [section 1681 of this title][/us/usc/t48/s1681].

 __Amendments__ 

    1983—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 98–213, § 3(a)][/us/pl/98/213/s3/a], substituted “1985” for “1983”.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 98–213, § 3(b)][/us/pl/98/213/s3/b], amended subsec. (c) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (c) read as follows: “It is the sense of Congress that the term ‘rebate’ as used in [section 602 of Public Law 94–241][/us/pl/94/241/s602] does not permit the abatement of taxes.”

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–597][/us/pl/96/597] substituted “until, but not after, January 1, 1983.” for “and before January 1, 1981.”.

 __Suspension of Prohibition of Abatement of Taxation in Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands__ 

    [Pub. L. 96–597, title III, § 303(b)][/us/pl/96/597/s303/b], Dec. 24, 1980, [94 Stat. 3478][/us/stat/94/3478], provided that provisions of subsec. (c) of this section were suspended and were of no force or effect until Jan. 1, 1983.
