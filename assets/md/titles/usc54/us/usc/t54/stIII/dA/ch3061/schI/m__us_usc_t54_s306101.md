    In subsection (a)(3), the cross reference is treated as a cross reference to [16 U.S.C. 470a(h)][/us/usc/t16/s470a/h], restated as subsection (c) of this section, rather than [16 U.S.C. 470a(g)][/us/usc/t16/s470a/g], restated as subsection (b) of this section, to correct an error in the source provision.

    In subsection (c), the words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Administrator of the General Services Administration” to use the correct title of the Administrator.
