    The words “National Park System Advisory Board” are substituted for “Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and Museums” because the Board was renamed when [section 3 of the Act of August 21, 1935][/us/act/1935-08-21/s3] (known as the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act (ch. 593, [49 Stat. 667][/us/stat/49/667])) was amended by [section 9 of Public Law 91–383][/us/pl/91/383/s9], as added by [section 2 of Public Law 94–458][/us/pl/94/458/s2] ([90 Stat. 1940][/us/stat/90/1940]).
