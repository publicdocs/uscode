## § 311105. Authorization of appropriations

    There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this chapter $25,000,000 for each fiscal year, to remain available until expended.

([Pub. L. 113–287, § 3][/us/pl/113/287/s3], Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 3249][/us/stat/128/3249]; [Pub. L. 113–291, div. B, title XXX, § 3033(e)][/us/pl/113/291/s3033/e], Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 3777][/us/stat/128/3777].)

 __Amendment Not Shown in Text__ 

    This section was derived from [section 469n(f) of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s469n/f], Conservation, which was amended by [Pub. L. 113–291, div. B, title XXX, § 3033(e)][/us/pl/113/291/s3033/e], Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 3777][/us/stat/128/3777]. For applicability of this amendment to this section, see [section 6 of Pub. L. 113–287][/us/pl/113/287/s6], set out as a Transitional and Savings Provisions note preceding [section 100101 of this title][/us/usc/t54/s100101]. Subsec. (f) of former [section 469n of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s469n] was amended by inserting “, except that the amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section not appropriated as of the date of enactment of the First State National Historical Park Act shall be reduced by $6,500,000” before period at end. \[No act with the title First State National Historical Park Act has been enacted. The date of enactment of the First State National Historical Park Act probably means the date of enactment of [section 3033 of Pub. L. 113–291][/us/pl/113/291/s3033], which was approved Dec. 19, 2014. [Section 3033 of Pub. L. 113–291][/us/pl/113/291/s3033] is classified to [section 410rrr of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s410rrr].\]
