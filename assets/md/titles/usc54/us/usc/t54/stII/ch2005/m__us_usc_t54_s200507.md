## § 200507. Conversion of recreation property

    No property improved or developed with assistance under this chapter shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public recreation uses. The Secretary shall approve such a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accord with the then-current local park and recreation recovery action program and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent location and usefulness.
