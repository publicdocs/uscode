    In subsection (b), the words “section 572(a) or 574(a) to (c) of title 40” are substituted for “section 485(b)(e)\[sic\], title 40, United States Code”, and the words “chapter 5 of title 40” are substituted for “the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended” because of [section 5(c) of the Act of August 21, 2002][/us/act/2002-08-21/s5/c] ([Public Law 107–217][/us/pl/107/217], [116 Stat. 1303][/us/stat/116/1303]), the 1st section of which enacted Title 40, United States Code, and in the case of “chapter 5 of title 40”, to provide a more precise cross reference. The words “any appropriation Act that appropriates an amount, to be derived from proceeds from the transfer of excess property and the disposal of surplus property, for necessary expenses, not otherwise provided for, incident to the utilization and disposal of excess and surplus property” are substituted for “the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1963 ([76 Stat. 725][/us/stat/76/725]) or in any later appropriation Act” to update the reference.
