For continued application of certain laws of the United States in certain cases, see the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America ([48 U.S.C. 1801][/us/usc/t48/s1801] note), the Compact of Free Association between the Government of the United States of America and the Governments of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia ([48 U.S.C. 1901][/us/usc/t48/s1901] note), and the Compact of Free Association between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Palau ([48 U.S.C. 1931][/us/usc/t48/s1931] note). The words “as determined by the Secretary” are added to make it clear that it is the Secretary who determines if it is practicable to include the stated entities.
