    In subsection (a), the words “reference in such Act” are interpreted to mean “reference in such Acts” for clarity.

    In subsection (b)(1), the words “relating to donation of land and money”, “relating to roads and trails”, “relating to approach roads to national monuments”, “relating to conveyance of roads to States”, “relating to acquisitions of inholdings”, and “relating to aid to visitors in emergencies” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “the Act of March 3, 1905 ([33 Stat. 873][/us/stat/33/873]; [16 U.S.C. 10][/us/usc/t16/s10]), relating to arrests” are omitted because the Act was repealed by [section 10(a)(2) of the Act of August 18, 1970][/us/act/1970-08-18/s10/a/2] (known as the National Park System General Authorities Act) ([Public Law 91–383][/us/pl/91/383]), as added by [section 2 of the Act of October 7, 1976][/us/act/1976-10-07/s2] ([Public Law 94–458][/us/pl/94/458], [90 Stat. 1941][/us/stat/90/1941]). The words “relating to services or other accommodations for the public, emergency supplies and services to concessioners, acceptability of travelers checks, care and removal of indigents” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “the Act of October 9, 1965 ([79 Stat. 696][/us/stat/79/696]; [16 U.S.C. 20–20g][/us/usc/t16/s20–20g]), relating to concessions” are omitted because the Act was repealed by section 415(a) of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 ([Public Law 105–391][/us/pl/105/391], [112 Stat. 3515][/us/stat/112/3515]).

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “relating to rights of way” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Subsection (b)(3) is added for clarity because many of the laws that established a System unit provided that the Secretary, in addition to administering the unit in accordance with the Act of August 25, 1916 ([16 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t16/s1], 3, 3, and 4) and with laws generally applicable to System units, administer the unit in accordance with the Act of August 21, 1935 ([16 U.S.C. 461][/us/usc/t16/s461] to 467).
