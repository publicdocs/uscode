## § 100733. Recordation of mining claims; publication of notice

    All mining claims under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. chapter 2, sections 161 and 162, and chapters 12A and 16) that lie within the boundaries of System units in existence on September 28, 1976, that were not recorded with the Secretary within one year after September 28, 1976, shall be conclusively presumed to be abandoned and shall be void. The recordation does not render valid any claim that was not valid on September 28, 1976, or that becomes invalid after that date.

([Pub. L. 113–287, § 3][/us/pl/113/287/s3], Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 3109][/us/stat/128/3109].)

    The section is substituted for the source provision to eliminate obsolete words. The words “in existence on September 28, 1976” are added for clarity to show that the provision applies only to System units that were part of the System on that date.
