    Section 103303 is substituted for [16 U.S.C. 421][/us/usc/t16/s421] to eliminate obsolete words because there no longer are park commissioners for the national military parks. The references to the Secretary of the Army are changed to the Secretary the Interior because the administrative functions of certain national military parks were transferred to the Department of the Interior by section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166, June 10, 1933, and section 1 of Executive Order No. 6228, July 28, 1933, set out as a note under [section 901 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s901], Government Organization and Employees. References to the National Park Service were substituted for references to the Office of National Parks, Buildings, and Reservations in section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 because of the last paragraph under the heading “OFFICE OF NATIONAL PARKS, BUILDINGS, AND RESERVATIONS” in [section 1 of the Act of March 2, 1934][/us/act/1934-03-02/s1] (ch. 38, [48 Stat. 389][/us/stat/48/389]).
