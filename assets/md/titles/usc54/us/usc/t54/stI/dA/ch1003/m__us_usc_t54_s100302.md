    In subsection (a)(3), the words “of the Hot Springs Reservation in the State of Arkansas” \[changed to “Hot Springs National Park” because of [section 1 of the Act of March 4, 1921][/us/act/1921-03-04/s1] (ch. 161, [41 Stat. 1407][/us/stat/41/1407])\] in [section 2 of the Act of August 25, 1916][/us/act/1916-08-25/s2] (known as the National Park Service Organic Act) (ch. 408, [39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535]) are omitted as unnecessary.

    Subsection (c) is substituted for the 5th sentence of [section 1 of the Act of August 25, 1916][/us/act/1916-08-25/s1] (known as the National Park Service Organic Act) (ch. 408, [39 Stat. 535][/us/stat/39/535]), to eliminate unnecessary words and because the pay of employees is fixed pursuant to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5.
