    In subsections (a) and (d)(1), the words “subchapter I of chapter 471 of title 49” are substituted for “the Federal Airport Act”. The Federal Airport Act was repealed by section 52(a) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 ([Public Law 91–258][/us/pl/91/258], [84 Stat. 235][/us/stat/84/235]), and the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 replaced the Federal Airport Act. The Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 was repealed by section 523(a) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ([Public Law 97–248][/us/pl/97/248], [96 Stat. 695][/us/stat/96/695]). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, which replaced the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, was enacted as subchapter I of chapter 471 of title 49 by [section 1(e) of the Act of July 5, 1994][/us/act/1994-07-05/s1/e] ([Public Law 103–272][/us/pl/103/272], [108 Stat. 1245][/us/stat/108/1245]).

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “[section 47103 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s47103]” are substituted for “the Federal Airport Act”. The Federal Airport Act was repealed by section 52(a) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 ([Public Law 91–258][/us/pl/91/258], [84 Stat. 235][/us/stat/84/235]). Section 12 of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, which provided for a national airport system plan, was replaced by section 504 of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ([Public Law 97–248][/us/pl/97/248], [96 Stat. 675][/us/stat/96/675]). Section 504 was enacted as [section 47103 of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s47103] by [section 1(e) of the Act of July 5, 1994][/us/act/1994-07-05/s1/e] ([Public Law 103–272][/us/pl/103/272], [108 Stat. 1251][/us/stat/108/1251]).

    In subsection (c), the text of [16 U.S.C. 7b][/us/usc/t16/s7b] (last proviso) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “chief executive official of the” are added for clarity and for consistency in the new title.
