    [Section 4(d) of the Act of July 27, 1990][/us/act/1990-07-27/s4/d] ([Public Law 101–337][/us/pl/101/337], [104 Stat. 380][/us/stat/104/380]), is omitted as obsolete. See section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Land 104–66, [31 U.S.C. 1113][/us/usc/t31/s1113] note) and page 111 of House Document No. 103–7.

    In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words “destruction, loss, or injury to” are substituted for “damage to” for consistency in the new chapter and to distinguish destruction, loss, or injury from damages recovered in a civil action.

    In subsection (b), the words “the General Fund of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary.
