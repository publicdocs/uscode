    The word “Secretary” is substituted for “National Park Service” to reflect the transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of the Department of the Interior to the Secretary by sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 (5 U.S.C. App.). The reference to [section 16 of title 41][/us/usc/t41/s16] is omitted as obsolete because section 3744 of the Revised Statutes, classified to [41 U.S.C. 16][/us/usc/t41/s16], was repealed by the Act of October 21, 1941 (ch. 452, [55 Stat. 743][/us/stat/55/743]).
