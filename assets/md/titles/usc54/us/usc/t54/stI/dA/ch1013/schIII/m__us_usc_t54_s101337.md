## § 101337. Leasing of seasonal employee quarters

    (a)  __General Authority__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary may lease quarters at or near a System unit for use as seasonal quarters for field employees if the Secretary finds that there is a shortage of adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or near the System unit and that—

        (1) the requirement for the seasonal field employee quarters is temporary; or

        (2) leasing would be more cost-effective than construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.

    (b)  __Rent__  __.—__ 

    The rent charged to field employees under the lease shall be a rate based on the reasonable value of the quarters in accordance with requirements applicable under [section 5911 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5911].

    (c)  __Unrecovered Costs__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary may pay the unrecovered costs of leasing seasonal quarters under this section from annual appropriations for the year in which the lease is made.
