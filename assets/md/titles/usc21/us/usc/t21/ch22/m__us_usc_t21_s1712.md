([Pub. L. 105–277, div. C, title VII][/us/pl/105/277/dC/tVII], § 715, Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2681–693][/us/stat/112/2681-693]; [Pub. L. 109–469, title VI][/us/pl/109/469/tVI], § 602, Dec. 29, 2006, [120 Stat. 3533][/us/stat/120/3533].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this title”, meaning title VII of [Pub. L. 105–277, div. C][/us/pl/105/277/dC], Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2681–670][/us/stat/112/2681-670], which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title VII to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1701 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s1701] and Tables.

    Section 713, referred to in subsec. (b), is [section 713 of Pub. L. 105–277][/us/pl/105/277/s713], div. C, title VII, Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2681–693][/us/stat/112/2681-693], which amended sections 5312 to 5314 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, [section 1105 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105], Money and Finance, and [section 3021 of Title 50][/us/usc/t50/s3021], War and National Defense.

 __Codification__ 

    The repeal of this chapter and of the amendments made by this chapter, effective Sept. 30, 2003, by this section, as in effect on Sept. 30, 2003, was not given effect in the Code, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because of the amendment to this section by [Pub. L. 109–469][/us/pl/109/469], enacted Dec. 29, 2006, which substituted “September 30, 2010” for “September 30, 2003” as the effective date of the repeal. See 2006 Amendment note below.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–469][/us/pl/109/469] substituted “September 30, 2010, this chapter and the amendments made to this chapter” for “September 30, 2003, this chapter and the amendments made by this chapter”.
