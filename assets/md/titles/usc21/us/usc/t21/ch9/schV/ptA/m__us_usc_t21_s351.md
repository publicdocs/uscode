## § 351. Adulterated drugs and devices

A drug or device shall be deemed to be adulterated—

    (a) __Poisonous, insanitary, etc., ingredients; adequate controls in manufacture__ 

        (1) If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance; or (2)(A) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; or (B) if it is a drug and the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess; or (C) if it is a compounded positron emission tomography drug and the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, its compounding, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with the positron emission tomography compounding standards and the official monographs of the United States Pharmacopoeia to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, that it purports or is represented to possess; or (3) if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; or (4) if (A) it bears or contains, for purposes of coloring only, a color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of [section 379e(a) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s379e/a], or (B) it is a color additive the intended use of which in or on drugs or devices is for purposes of coloring only and is unsafe within the meaning of [section 379e(a) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s379e/a]; or (5) if it is a new animal drug which is unsafe within the meaning of [section 360b of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360b]; or (6) if it is an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, and such animal feed is unsafe within the meaning of [section 360b of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360b].

    (b) __Strength, quality, or purity differing from official compendium__ 

        If it purports to be or is represented as a drug the name of which is recognized in an official compendium, and its strength differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, the standard set forth in such compendium. Such determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made in accordance with the tests or methods of assay set forth in such compendium, except that whenever tests or methods of assay have not been prescribed in such compendium, or such tests or methods of assay as are prescribed are, in the judgment of the Secretary, insufficient for the making of such determination, the Secretary shall bring such fact to the attention of the appropriate body charged with the revision of such compendium, and if such body fails within a reasonable time to prescribe tests or methods of assay which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are sufficient for purposes of this paragraph, then the Secretary shall promulgate regulations prescribing appropriate tests or methods of assay in accordance with which such determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made. No drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be adulterated under this paragraph because it differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity therefor set forth in such compendium, if its difference in strength, quality, or purity from such standard is plainly stated on its label. Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United States Pharmacopoeia.

    (c) __Misrepresentation of strength, etc., where drug is unrecognized in compendium__ 

        If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and its strength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess.

    (d) __Mixture with or substitution of another substance__ 

        If it is a drug and any substance has been (1) mixed or packed therewith so as to reduce its quality or strength or (2) substituted wholly or in part therefor.

    (e) __Devices not in conformity with performance standards__ 

        (1) If it is, or purports to be or is represented as, a device which is subject to a performance standard established under [section 360d of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360d] unless such device is in all respects in conformity with such standard.

        (2) If it is declared to be, purports to be, or is represented as, a device that is in conformity with any standard recognized under [section 360d(c) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360d/c] unless such device is in all respects in conformity with such standard.
