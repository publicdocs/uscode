## § 387e. Annual registration

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing__ 

            The term “manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing” shall include repackaging or otherwise changing the container, wrapper, or labeling of any tobacco product package in furtherance of the distribution of the tobacco product from the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimate consumer or user.

        (2) __Name__ 

            The term “name” shall include in the case of a partnership the name of each partner and, in the case of a corporation, the name of each corporate officer and director, and the State of incorporation.

    (b) __Registration by owners and operators__ 

        On or before December 31 of each year, every person who owns or operates any establishment in any State engaged in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products shall register with the Secretary the name, places of business, and all such establishments of that person. If enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act occurs in the second half of the calendar year, the Secretary shall designate a date no later than 6 months into the subsequent calendar year by which registration pursuant to this subsection shall occur.

    (c) __Registration by new owners and operators__ 

        Every person upon first engaging in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products in any establishment owned or operated in any State by that person shall immediately register with the Secretary that person’s name, place of business, and such establishment.

    (d) __Registration of added establishments__ 

        Every person required to register under subsection (b) or (c) shall immediately register with the Secretary any additional establishment which that person owns or operates in any State and in which that person begins the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products.

    (e) __Uniform product identification system__ 

        The Secretary may by regulation prescribe a uniform system for the identification of tobacco products and may require that persons who are required to list such tobacco products under subsection (i) shall list such tobacco products in accordance with such system.

    (f) __Public access to registration information__ 

        The Secretary shall make available for inspection, to any person so requesting, any registration filed under this section.

    (g) __Biennial inspection of registered establishments__ 

        Every establishment registered with the Secretary under this section shall be subject to inspection under [section 374 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s374] or subsection (h), and every such establishment engaged in the manufacture, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products shall be so inspected by 1 or more officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary at least once in the 2-year period beginning with the date of registration of such establishment under this section and at least once in every successive 2-year period thereafter.

    (h) __Registration by foreign establishments__ 

        Any establishment within any foreign country engaged in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products, shall register under this section under regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Such regulations shall require such establishment to provide the information required by subsection (i) and shall include provisions for registration of any such establishment upon condition that adequate and effective means are available, by arrangement with the government of such foreign country or otherwise, to enable the Secretary to determine from time to time whether tobacco products manufactured, prepared, compounded, or processed in such establishment, if imported or offered for import into the United States, shall be refused admission on any of the grounds set forth in [section 381(a) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s381/a].

    (i) __Registration information__ 

        (1) __Product list__ 

        Every person who registers with the Secretary under subsection (b), (c), (d), or (h) shall, at the time of registration under any such subsection, file with the Secretary a list of all tobacco products which are being manufactured, prepared, compounded, or processed by that person for commercial distribution and which have not been included in any list of tobacco products filed by that person with the Secretary under this paragraph or paragraph (2) before such time of registration. Such list shall be prepared in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe and shall be accompanied by—

            (A) in the case of a tobacco product contained in the applicable list with respect to which a tobacco product standard has been established under [section 387g of this title][/us/usc/t21/s387g] or which is subject to [section 387j of this title][/us/usc/t21/s387j], a reference to the authority for the marketing of such tobacco product and a copy of all labeling for such tobacco product;

            (B) in the case of any other tobacco product contained in an applicable list, a copy of all consumer information and other labeling for such tobacco product, a representative sampling of advertisements for such tobacco product, and, upon request made by the Secretary for good cause, a copy of all advertisements for a particular tobacco product; and

        (2) __Consultation with respect to forms__ 

            The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury in developing the forms to be used for registration under this section to minimize the burden on those persons required to register with both the Secretary and the Tax and Trade Bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        (3) __Biannual report of any change in product list__ 

        Each person who registers with the Secretary under this section shall report to the Secretary once during the month of June of each year and once during the month of December of each year the following:

            (B) If since the date the registrant last made a report under this paragraph that person has discontinued the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing for commercial distribution of a tobacco product included in a list filed under subparagraph (A) or paragraph (1), notice of such discontinuance, the date of such discontinuance, and the identity of its established name.

            (C) If since the date the registrant reported under subparagraph (B) a notice of discontinuance that person has resumed the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing for commercial distribution of the tobacco product with respect to which such notice of discontinuance was reported, notice of such resumption, the date of such resumption, the identity of such tobacco product by established name, and other information required by paragraph (1), unless the registrant has previously reported such resumption to the Secretary under this subparagraph.

        (1) __In general__

            (A)

             the basis for such person’s determination that—

                (i) the tobacco product is substantially equivalent, within the meaning of [section 387j of this title][/us/usc/t21/s387j], to a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or to a tobacco product that the Secretary has previously determined, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of [section 387j of this title][/us/usc/t21/s387j], is substantially equivalent and that is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter; or

        (3) __Exemptions__ 

            (A) __In general__

                (i) such modification would be a minor modification of a tobacco product that can be sold under this chapter;

                (ii) a report under this subsection is not necessary to ensure that permitting the tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for protection of the public health; and

                (iii) an exemption is otherwise appropriate.

            (B) __Regulations__ 

                Not later than 15 months after June 22, 2009, the Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this paragraph.
