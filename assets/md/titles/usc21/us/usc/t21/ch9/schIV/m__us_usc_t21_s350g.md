## § 350g. Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls

    (a) __In general__ 

        The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall, in accordance with this section, evaluate the hazards that could affect food manufactured, processed, packed, or held by such facility, identify and implement preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of such hazards and provide assurances that such food is not adulterated under [section 342 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s342] or misbranded under [section 343(w) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/w], monitor the performance of those controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of routine practice.

    (b) __Hazard analysis__ 

    The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall—

        (1)

         identify and evaluate known or reasonably foreseeable hazards that may be associated with the facility, including—

            (A) biological, chemical, physical, and radiological hazards, natural toxins, pesticides, drug residues, decomposition, parasites, allergens, and unapproved food and color additives; and

            (B) hazards that occur naturally, or may be unintentionally introduced; and

        (2) identify and evaluate hazards that may be intentionally introduced, including by acts of terrorism; and

        (3) develop a written analysis of the hazards.

    (c) __Preventive controls__ 

    The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall identify and implement preventive controls, including at critical control points, if any, to provide assurances that—

        (1) hazards identified in the hazard analysis conducted under subsection (b)(1) will be significantly minimized or prevented;

        (2) any hazards identified in the hazard analysis conducted under subsection (b)(2) will be significantly minimized or prevented and addressed, consistent with [section 350i of this title][/us/usc/t21/s350i], as applicable; and

        (3) the food manufactured, processed, packed, or held by such facility will not be adulterated under [section 342 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s342] or misbranded under [section 343(w) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/w].

    (d) __Monitoring of effectiveness__ 

        The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls implemented under subsection (c) to provide assurances that the outcomes described in subsection (c) shall be achieved.

    (e) __Corrective actions__ 

    The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall establish procedures to ensure that, if the preventive controls implemented under subsection (c) are not properly implemented or are found to be ineffective—

        (1) appropriate action is taken to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the implementation failure;

        (2) all affected food is evaluated for safety; and

        (3) all affected food is prevented from entering into commerce if the owner, operator or agent in charge of such facility cannot ensure that the affected food is not adulterated under [section 342 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s342] or misbranded under [section 343(w) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/w].

    (f) __Verification__ 

    The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall verify that—

        (1) the preventive controls implemented under subsection (c) are adequate to control the hazards identified under subsection (b);

        (2) the owner, operator, or agent is conducting monitoring in accordance with subsection (d);

        (3) the owner, operator, or agent is making appropriate decisions about corrective actions taken under subsection (e);

        (4) the preventive controls implemented under subsection (c) are effectively and significantly minimizing or preventing the occurrence of identified hazards, including through the use of environmental and product testing programs and other appropriate means; and

        (5) there is documented, periodic reanalysis of the plan under subsection (i) to ensure that the plan is still relevant to the raw materials, conditions and processes in the facility, and new and emerging threats.

    (g) __Recordkeeping__ 

        The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall maintain, for not less than 2 years, records documenting the monitoring of the preventive controls implemented under subsection (c), instances of nonconformance material to food safety, the results of testing and other appropriate means of verification under subsection (f)(4), instances when corrective actions were implemented, and the efficacy of preventive controls and corrective actions.

    (h) __Written plan and documentation__ 

        The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall prepare a written plan that documents and describes the procedures used by the facility to comply with the requirements of this section, including analyzing the hazards under subsection (b) and identifying the preventive controls adopted under subsection (c) to address those hazards. Such written plan, together with the documentation described in subsection (g), shall be made promptly available to a duly authorized representative of the Secretary upon oral or written request.

    (i) __Requirement to reanalyze__ 

        The owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility shall conduct a reanalysis under subsection (b) whenever a significant change is made in the activities conducted at a facility operated by such owner, operator, or agent if the change creates a reasonable potential for a new hazard or a significant increase in a previously identified hazard or not less frequently than once every 3 years, whichever is earlier. Such reanalysis shall be completed and additional preventive controls needed to address the hazard identified, if any, shall be implemented before the change in activities at the facility is operative. Such owner, operator, or agent shall revise the written plan required under subsection (h) if such a significant change is made or document the basis for the conclusion that no additional or revised preventive controls are needed. The Secretary may require a reanalysis under this section to respond to new hazards and developments in scientific understanding, including, as appropriate, results from the Department of Homeland Security biological, chemical, radiological, or other terrorism risk assessment.
