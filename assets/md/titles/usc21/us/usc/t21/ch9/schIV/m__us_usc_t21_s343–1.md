        (4) any requirement for nutrition labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of [section 343(q) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/q], except that this paragraph does not apply to food that is offered for sale in a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is not part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name (regardless of the type of ownership of the locations) and offering for sale substantially the same menu items unless such restaurant or similar retail food establishment complies with the voluntary provision of nutrition information requirements under [section 343(q)(5)(H)(ix) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/q/5/H/ix], or

        (5) any requirement respecting any claim of the type described in [section 343(r)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/r/1] made in the label or labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of [section 343(r) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/r], except a requirement respecting a claim made in the label or labeling of food which is exempt under [section 343(r)(5)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s343/r/5/B].
