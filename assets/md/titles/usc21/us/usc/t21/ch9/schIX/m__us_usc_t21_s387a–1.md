                    “(I) any tobacco product advertising;

                    “(II) a brand name other than in conjunction with words for an area or enclosure to identify an adult-only facility; or

                A qualified adult-only facility (as such term is defined in section 897.16(d) of the final rule published under paragraph (1)) that is also a retailer and that commits a violation as a retailer shall not be subject to the limitations in section 103(q)  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original.
