    (a) __Report to Congress__ 

    The Secretary shall conduct the following studies, and shall make a report or reports of the results of such studies to the Congress on or before January 1, 1970, and from time to time thereafter as he may find necessary, together with such recommendations for legislation as he may deem appropriate:

        (1)

         A study of present State and Federal control of health hazards from electronic product radiation and other types of ionizing radiation, which study shall include, but not be limited to—

            (A) control of health hazards from radioactive materials other than materials regulated under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \[[42 U.S.C. 2011][/us/usc/t42/s2011] et seq.\];

            (B) any gaps and inconsistencies in present controls;

            (C) the need for controlling the sale of certain used electronic products, particularly antiquated X-ray equipment, without upgrading such products to meet the standards for new products or separate standards for used products;

            (D) measures to assure consistent and effective control of the aforementioned health hazards;

            (E) measures to strengthen radiological health programs of State governments; and

            (F) the feasibility of authorizing the Secretary to enter into arrangements with individual States or groups of States to define their respective functions and responsibilities for the control of electronic product radiation and other ionizing radiation;

        (2) A study to determine the necessity for the development of standards for the use of nonmedical electronic products for commercial and industrial purposes; and

        (3) A study of the development of practicable procedures for the detection and measurement of electronic product radiation which may be emitted from electronic products manufactured or imported prior to the effective date of any applicable standard established pursuant to this part.

    (b) __Participation of other Federal agencies__ 

        In carrying out these studies, the Secretary shall invite the participation of other Federal departments and agencies having related responsibilities and interests, State governments—particularly those of States which regulate radioactive materials under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \[[42 U.S.C. 2021][/us/usc/t42/s2021]\], and interested professional, labor, and industrial organizations. Upon request from congressional committees interested in these studies, the Secretary shall keep these committees currently informed as to the progress of the studies and shall permit the committees to send observers to meetings of the study groups.

    (c) __Organization of studies and participation__ 

        The Secretary or his designee shall organize the studies and the participation of the invited participants as he deems best. Any dissent from the findings and recommendations of the Secretary shall be included in the report if so requested by the dissenter.
