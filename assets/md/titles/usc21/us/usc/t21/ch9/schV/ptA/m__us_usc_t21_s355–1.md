## § 355–1. Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies

    (a) __Submission of proposed strategy__ 

        (1) __Initial approval__ 

        If the Secretary, in consultation with the office responsible for reviewing the drug and the office responsible for postapproval safety with respect to the drug, determines that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug, and informs the person who submits such application of such determination, then such person shall submit to the Secretary as part of such application a proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. In making such a determination, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:

            (A) The estimated size of the population likely to use the drug involved.

            (B) The seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated with the drug.

            (C) The expected benefit of the drug with respect to such disease or condition.

            (D) The expected or actual duration of treatment with the drug.

            (E) The seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug and the background incidence of such events in the population likely to use the drug.

            (F) Whether the drug is a new molecular entity.

        (2) __Postapproval requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the Secretary has approved a covered application (including an application approved before the effective date of this section) and did not when approving the application require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the offices described in paragraph (1), may subsequently require such a strategy for the drug involved (including when acting on a supplemental application seeking approval of a new indication for use of the drug) if the Secretary becomes aware of new safety information and makes a determination that such a strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug.

            (B) __Submission of proposed strategy__ 

                Not later than 120 days after the Secretary notifies the holder of an approved covered application that the Secretary has made a determination under subparagraph (A) with respect to the drug involved, or within such other reasonable time as the Secretary requires to protect the public health, the holder shall submit to the Secretary a proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.

        (3) __Abbreviated new drug applications__

    (e) __Additional potential elements of strategy__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the offices described in subsection (c)(2), may under such subsection require that the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug include 1 or more of the additional elements described in this subsection if the Secretary makes the determination required with respect to each element involved.

        (2) __Medication Guide; patient package insert__ 

        The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug may require that, as applicable, the responsible person develop for distribution to each patient when the drug is dispensed—

            (A) a Medication Guide, as provided for under part 208 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations); and

            (B) a patient package insert, if the Secretary determines that such insert may help mitigate a serious risk of the drug.

        (3) __Communication plan__ 

        The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug may require that the responsible person conduct a communication plan to health care providers, if, with respect to such drug, the Secretary determines that such plan may support implementation of an element of the strategy (including under this paragraph). Such plan may include—

            (A) sending letters to health care providers;

            (B) disseminating information about the elements of the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to encourage implementation by health care providers of components that apply to such health care providers, or to explain certain safety protocols (such as medical monitoring by periodic laboratory tests); or

            (C) disseminating information to health care providers through professional societies about any serious risks of the drug and any protocol to assure safe use.

    (f) __Providing safe access for patients to drugs with known serious risks that would otherwise be unavailable__ 

        (1) __Allowing safe access to drugs with known serious risks__ 

        The Secretary, in consultation with the offices described in subsection (c)(2), may require that the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug include such elements as are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, because of its inherent toxicity or potential harmfulness, if the Secretary determines that—

            (A) the drug, which has been shown to be effective, but is associated with a serious adverse drug experience, can be approved only if, or would be withdrawn unless, such elements are required as part of such strategy to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug; and

            (B) for a drug initially approved without elements to assure safe use, other elements under subsections (c), (d), and (e) are not sufficient to mitigate such serious risk.

        (2) __Assuring access and minimizing burden__ 

        Such elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) be commensurate with the specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug;

            (B) within 30 days of the date on which any element under paragraph (1) is imposed, be posted publicly by the Secretary with an explanation of how such elements will mitigate the observed safety risk;

            (C)

             considering such risk, not be unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug, considering in particular—

                (i) patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions; and

                (ii) patients who have difficulty accessing health care (such as patients in rural or medically underserved areas); and

            (D)

             to the extent practicable, so as to minimize the burden on the health care delivery system—

                (i) conform with elements to assure safe use for other drugs with similar, serious risks; and

                (ii) be designed to be compatible with established distribution, procurement, and dispensing systems for drugs.

        (3) __Elements to assure safe use__ 

        The elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) shall include 1 or more goals to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug and, to mitigate such risk, may require that—

            (A) health care providers who prescribe the drug have particular training or experience, or are specially certified (the opportunity to obtain such training or certification with respect to the drug shall be available to any willing provider from a frontier area in a widely available training or certification method (including an on-line course or via mail) as approved by the Secretary at reasonable cost to the provider);

            (B) pharmacies, practitioners, or health care settings that dispense the drug are specially certified (the opportunity to obtain such certification shall be available to any willing provider from a frontier area);

            (C) the drug be dispensed to patients only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals;

            (D) the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence or other documentation of safe-use conditions, such as laboratory test results;

            (E) each patient using the drug be subject to certain monitoring; or

            (F) each patient using the drug be enrolled in a registry.

        (4) __Implementation system__ 

        The elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) that are described in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (3) may include a system through which the applicant is able to take reasonable steps to—

            (A) monitor and evaluate implementation of such elements by health care providers, pharmacists, and other parties in the health care system who are responsible for implementing such elements; and

            (B) work to improve implementation of such elements by such persons.

        (5) __Evaluation of elements to assure safe use__ 

        The Secretary, through the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (or successor committee) of the Food and Drug Administration, shall—

            (A)

             seek input from patients, physicians, pharmacists, and other health care providers about how elements to assure safe use under this subsection for 1 or more drugs may be standardized so as not to be—

                (i) unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug; and

                (ii) to the extent practicable, minimize the burden on the health care delivery system;

            (B)

             at least annually, evaluate, for 1 or more drugs, the elements to assure safe use of such drug to assess whether the elements—

                (i) assure safe use of the drug;

                (ii) are not unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug; and

                (iii) to the extent practicable, minimize the burden on the health care delivery system; and

            (C)

             considering such input and evaluations—

                (i) issue or modify agency guidance about how to implement the requirements of this subsection; and

                (ii) modify elements under this subsection for 1 or more drugs as appropriate.

        (6) __Additional mechanisms to assure access__ 

            The mechanisms under [section 360bbb of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360bbb] to provide for expanded access for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be used to provide access for patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the treatment of which is not an approved use for the drug, to a drug that is subject to elements to assure safe use under this subsection. The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for how a physician may provide the drug under the mechanisms of [section 360bbb of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360bbb].

            (A) A Medication Guide or patient package insert, if required under subsection (e) for the applicable listed drug.

            (B)

             Elements to assure safe use, if required under subsection (f) for the listed drug. A drug that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application and the listed drug shall use a single, shared system under subsection (f). The Secretary may waive the requirement under the preceding sentence for a drug that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application, and permit the applicant to use a different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use, if the Secretary determines that—

                (i) the burden of creating a single, shared system outweighs the benefit of a single, system, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “single, shared system,”. </sup></sup>  taking into consideration the impact on health care providers, patients, the applicant for the abbreviated new drug application, and the holder of the reference drug product; or

                (ii) an aspect of the elements to assure safe use for the applicable listed drug is claimed by a patent that has not expired or is a method or process that, as a trade secret, is entitled to protection, and the applicant for the abbreviated new drug application certifies that it has sought a license for use of an aspect of the elements to assure safe use for the applicable listed drug and that it was unable to obtain a license.

                A certification under clause (ii) shall include a description of the efforts made by the applicant for the abbreviated new drug application to obtain a license. In a case described in clause (ii), the Secretary may seek to negotiate a voluntary agreement with the owner of the patent, method, or process for a license under which the applicant for such abbreviated new drug application may use an aspect of the elements to assure safe use, if required under subsection (f) for the applicable listed drug, that is claimed by a patent that has not expired or is a method or process that as a trade secret is entitled to protection.

        (2) __Action by Secretary__ 

        For an applicable listed drug for which a drug is approved under [section 355(j) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/j], the Secretary—

            (A) shall undertake any communication plan to health care providers required under subsection (e)(3) for the applicable listed drug; and

    (j) __Drug Safety Oversight Board__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There is established a Drug Safety Oversight Board.

        (2) __Composition; meetings__

            (B) include representatives from offices throughout the Food and Drug Administration, including the offices responsible for postapproval safety of drugs;

            (C) include at least 1 representative each from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services (other than the Food and Drug Administration);

            (D) include such representatives as the Secretary shall designate from other appropriate agencies that wish to provide representatives; and
