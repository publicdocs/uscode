## § 355c. Research into pediatric uses for drugs and biological products

    (a) __New drugs and biological products__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        A person that submits, on or after September 27, 2007, an application (or supplement to an application) for a drug—

            (A) under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration, or

            (B) under [section 262 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262] for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration,

            shall submit with the application the assessments described in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Assessments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The assessments referred to in paragraph (1) shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate—

                (i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and

                (ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective.

            (B) __Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or biological product__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.

                (ii) __Extrapolation between age groups__ 

                    A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age group.

                (iii) __Information on extrapolation__ 

                    A brief documentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be included in any pertinent reviews for the application under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] or [section 262 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262].

        (3) __Deferral__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1) until a specified date after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a biological product if—

                (i)

                 the Secretary finds that—

                    (I) the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;

                    (II) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or

                    (III) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and

                (ii)

                 the applicant submits to the Secretary—

                    (I) certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments;

                    (II) a pediatric study plan as described in subsection (e);

                    (III) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and

                    (IV) a timeline for the completion of such studies.

            (B) __Deferral extension__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may grant an extension of a deferral approved under subparagraph (A) for submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1) if—

                    (I) the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subclause (II) or (III) of subparagraph (A)(i) continue to be met; and

                    (II) the applicant submits a new timeline under subparagraph (A)(ii)(IV) and any significant updates to the information required under subparagraph (A)(ii).

                (ii) __Timing and information__ 

                    If the deferral extension under this subparagraph is requested by the applicant, the applicant shall submit the deferral extension request containing the information described in this subparagraph not less than 90 days prior to the date that the deferral would expire. The Secretary shall respond to such request not later than 45 days after the receipt of such letter. If the Secretary grants such an extension, the specified date shall be the extended date. The sponsor of the required assessment under paragraph (1) shall not be issued a letter described in subsection (d) unless the specified or extended date of submission for such required studies has passed or if the request for an extension is pending. For a deferral that has expired prior to July 9, 2012, or that will expire prior to 270 days after July 9, 2012, a deferral extension shall be requested by an applicant not later than 180 days after July 9, 2012. The Secretary shall respond to any such request as soon as practicable, but not later than 1 year after July 9, 2012. Nothing in this clause shall prevent the Secretary from updating the status of a study or studies publicly if components of such study or studies are late or delayed.

            (C) __Annual review__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                On an annual basis following the approval of a deferral under subparagraph (A), the applicant shall submit to the Secretary the following information:

                    (I) Information detailing the progress made in conducting pediatric studies.

                    (II) If no progress has been made in conducting such studies, evidence and documentation that such studies will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time.

                    (III) Projected completion date for pediatric studies.

                    (IV) The reason or reasons why a deferral or deferral extension continues to be necessary.

                (ii) __Public availability__ 

                Not later than 90 days after the submission to the Secretary of the information submitted through the annual review under clause (i), the Secretary shall make available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration—

                    (I) such information;

                    (II) the name of the applicant for the product subject to the assessment;

                    (III) the date on which the product was approved; and

                    (IV) the date of each deferral or deferral extension under this paragraph for the product.

        (4) __Waivers__ 

            (A) __Full waiver__ 

            On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a drug or biological product under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—

                (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients is so small or the patients are geographically dispersed);

                (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups; or

                (iii)

                 the drug or biological product—

                    (I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients; and

                    (II) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients.

            (B) __Partial waiver__ 

            On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a drug or biological product under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—

                (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed);

                (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group;

                (iii)

                 the drug or biological product—

                    (I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group; and

                    (II) is not likely to be used by a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group; or

                (iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.

            (C) __Pediatric formulation not possible__ 

                If a partial waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only the pediatric groups requiring that formulation. An applicant seeking such a partial waiver shall submit to the Secretary documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed and, if the waiver is granted, the applicant’s submission shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.

            (D) __Labeling requirement__ 

                If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological product.

    (b) __Marketed drugs and biological products__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary may (by order in the form of a letter) require the sponsor or holder of an approved application for a drug under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] or the holder of a license for a biological product under [section 262 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262] to submit by a specified date the assessments described in subsection (a)(2), if the Secretary finds that—

            (A)

                (i) the drug or biological product is used for a substantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled indications; and

                (ii) adequate pediatric labeling could confer a benefit on pediatric patients;

            (B) there is reason to believe that the drug or biological product would represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients for 1 or more of the claimed indications; or

            (C) the absence of adequate pediatric labeling could pose a risk to pediatric patients.

        (2) __Waivers__ 

            (A) __Full waiver__ 

            At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—

                (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed); or

                (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups.

            (B) __Partial waiver__ 

            At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—

                (i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed);

                (ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group;

                (iii)

                    (I)

                     the drug or biological product—

                        (aa) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group; and

                        (bb) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group; and

                    (II) the absence of adequate labeling could not pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or

                (iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.

            (C) __Pediatric formulation not possible__ 

                If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only the pediatric groups requiring that formulation. An applicant seeking either a full or partial waiver shall submit to the Secretary documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed and, if the waiver is granted, the applicant’s submission shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.

            (D) __Labeling requirement__ 

                If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological product.

        (3) __Effect of subsection__ 

            Nothing in this subsection alters or amends [section 331(j) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s331/j] or [section 552 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552] or [section 1905 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1905].

    (c) __Meaningful therapeutic benefit__ 

    For the purposes of paragraph (4)(A)(iii)(I) and (4)(B)(iii)(I) of subsection (a) and paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) of subsection (b), a drug or biological product shall be considered to represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies if the Secretary determines that—

        (1) if approved, the drug or biological product could represent an improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, compared with marketed products adequately labeled for that use in the relevant pediatric population; or

        (2) the drug or biological product is in a class of products or for an indication for which there is a need for additional options.

    (d) __Submission of assessments__ 

    If a person fails to submit a required assessment described in subsection (a)(2), fails to meet the applicable requirements in subsection (a)(3), or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in subsection (a) or (b), in accordance with applicable provisions of subsections (a) and (b), the following shall apply:

        (1) Beginning 270 days after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall issue a non-compliance letter to such person informing them of such failure to submit or meet the requirements of the applicable subsection. Such letter shall require the person to respond in writing within 45 calendar days of issuance of such letter. Such response may include the person’s request for a deferral extension if applicable. Such letter and the person’s written response to such letter shall be made publicly available on the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration 60 calendar days after issuance, with redactions for any trade secrets and confidential commercial information. If the Secretary determines that the letter was issued in error, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply.

        (2)

         The drug or biological product that is the subject of an assessment described in subsection (a)(2), applicable requirements in subsection (a)(3), or request for approval of a pediatric formulation, may be considered misbranded solely because of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action (except that the drug or biological product shall not be subject to action under [section 333 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s333]), but such failure shall not be the basis for a proceeding—

            (A) to withdraw approval for a drug under [section 355(e) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/e]; or

            (B) to revoke the license for a biological product under [section 262 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262].

    (e) __Pediatric study plans__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            An applicant subject to subsection (a) shall submit to the Secretary an initial pediatric study plan prior to the submission of the assessments described under subsection (a)(2).
