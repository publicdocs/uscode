## § 353b. Outsourcing facilities

    (a) __In general__ 

    Sections 352(f)(1), 355, and 360eee–1 of this title shall not apply to a drug compounded by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in a facility that elects to register as an outsourcing facility if each of the following conditions is met:

        (1) __Registration and reporting__ 

            The drug is compounded in an outsourcing facility that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (b).

        (2) __Bulk drug substances__ 

        The drug is compounded in an outsourcing facility that does not compound using bulk drug substances (as defined in section 207.3(a)(4) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation)), unless—

            (A)

                (i)

                 the bulk drug substance appears on a list established by the Secretary identifying bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, by—

                    (I) publishing a notice in the Federal Register proposing bulk drug substances to be included on the list, including the rationale for such proposal;

                    (II) providing a period of not less than 60 calendar days for comment on the notice; and

                    (III) publishing a notice in the Federal Register designating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list; or

                (ii) the drug compounded from such bulk drug substance appears on the drug shortage list in effect under [section 356e of this title][/us/usc/t21/s356e] at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing;

            (B) if an applicable monograph exists under the United States Pharmacopeia, the National Formulary, or another compendium or pharmacopeia recognized by the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph, the bulk drug substances each comply with the monograph;

            (C) the bulk drug substances are each manufactured by an establishment that is registered under [section 360 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360] (including a foreign establishment that is registered under [section 360(i) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s360/i]); and

            (D) the bulk drug substances are each accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis.

        (3) __Ingredients (other than bulk drug substances)__ 

            If any ingredients (other than bulk drug substances) are used in compounding the drug, such ingredients comply with the standards of the applicable United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary monograph, if such monograph exists, or of another compendium or pharmacopeia recognized by the Secretary for purposes of this paragraph if any.

        (4) __Drugs withdrawn or removed because unsafe or not effective__ 

            The drug does not appear on a list published by the Secretary of drugs that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drugs or components of such drugs have been found to be unsafe or not effective.

        (5) __Essentially a copy of an approved drug__ 

            The drug is not essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs.

        (6) __Drugs presenting demonstrable difficulties for compounding__ 

        The drug—

            (A) is not identified (directly or as part of a category of drugs) on a list published by the Secretary, through the process described in subsection (c), of drugs or categories of drugs that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding that are reasonably likely to lead to an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug or category of drugs, taking into account the risks and benefits to patients; or

            (B) is compounded in accordance with all applicable conditions identified on the list described in subparagraph (A) as conditions that are necessary to prevent the drug or category of drugs from presenting the demonstrable difficulties described in subparagraph (A).

        (7) __Elements to assure safe use__ 

            In the case of a drug that is compounded from a drug that is the subject of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy approved with elements to assure safe use pursuant to [section 355–1 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355–1], or from a bulk drug substance that is a component of such drug, the outsourcing facility demonstrates to the Secretary prior to beginning compounding that such facility will utilize controls comparable to the controls applicable under the relevant risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.

        (8) __Prohibition on wholesaling__ 

            The drug will not be sold or transferred by an entity other than the outsourcing facility that compounded such drug. This paragraph does not prohibit administration of a drug in a health care setting or dispensing a drug pursuant to a prescription executed in accordance with [section 353(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s353/b/1].

        (9) __Fees__ 

            The drug is compounded in an outsourcing facility that has paid all fees owed by such facility pursuant to [section 379j–62 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s379j–62].

        (10) __Labeling of drugs__ 

            (A) __Label__

                    (X) subject to subparagraph (B)(i), a list of active and inactive ingredients, identified by established name and the quantity or proportion of each ingredient.

            (B) __Container__ 

            The container from which the individual units of the drug are removed for dispensing or for administration (such as a plastic bag containing individual product syringes) shall include—

                (i) the information described under subparagraph (A)(iii)(X), if there is not space on the label for such information;

                (ii) the following information to facilitate adverse event reporting: www.fda.gov/medwatch and 1–800–FDA–1088 (or any successor Internet Web site or phone number); and
