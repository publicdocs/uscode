## § 356b. Reports of postmarketing studies

    (a) __Submission__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A sponsor of a drug that has entered into an agreement with the Secretary to conduct a postmarketing study of a drug shall submit to the Secretary, within 1 year after the approval of such drug and annually thereafter until the study is completed or terminated, a report of the progress of the study or the reasons for the failure of the sponsor to conduct the study. The report shall be submitted in such form as is prescribed by the Secretary in regulations issued by the Secretary.

        (2) __Agreements prior to effective date__ 

            Any agreement entered into between the Secretary and a sponsor of a drug, prior to November 21, 1997, to conduct a postmarketing study of a drug shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (1). An initial report for such an agreement shall be submitted within 6 months after the date of the issuance of the regulations under paragraph (1).

    (b) __Consideration of information as public information__ 

    Any information pertaining to a report described in subsection (a) of this section shall be considered to be public information to the extent that the information is necessary—

        (1) to identify the sponsor; and

        (2) to establish the status of a study described in subsection (a) of this section and the reasons, if any, for any failure to carry out the study.

    (c) __Status of studies and reports__ 

    The Secretary shall annually develop and publish in the Federal Register a report that provides information on the status of the postmarketing studies—

        (1) that sponsors have entered into agreements to conduct; and

        (2) for which reports have been submitted under subsection (a)(1) of this section.

    (d) __Disclosure__ 

        If a sponsor fails to complete an agreed upon study required by this section by its original or otherwise negotiated deadline, the Secretary shall publish a statement on the Internet site of the Food and Drug Administration stating that the study was not completed and, if the reasons for such failure to complete the study were not satisfactory to the Secretary, a statement that such reasons were not satisfactory to the Secretary.

    (e) __Notification__ 

        With respect to studies of the type required under [section 356(c)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s356/c/2/A] or under section 314.510 or 601.41 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as each of such sections was in effect on the day before the effective date of this subsection, the Secretary may require that a sponsor who, for reasons not satisfactory to the Secretary, fails to complete by its deadline a study under any of such sections of such type for a drug or biological product (including such a study conducted after such effective date) notify practitioners who prescribe such drug or biological product of the failure to complete such study and the questions of clinical benefit, and, where appropriate, questions of safety, that remain unanswered as a result of the failure to complete such study. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as altering the requirements of the types of studies required under [section 356(c)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s356/c/2/A] or under section 314.510 or 601.41 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as so in effect, or as prohibiting the Secretary from modifying such sections of title 21 of such Code to provide for studies in addition to those of such type.
