## § 352. Misbranded drugs and devices

    A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded—

    (a) __False or misleading label__ 

        If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Health care economic information provided to a formulary committee, or other similar entity, in the course of the committee or the entity carrying out its responsibilities for the selection of drugs for managed care or other similar organizations, shall not be considered to be false or misleading under this paragraph if the health care economic information directly relates to an indication approved under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] or under [section 262(a) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262/a] for such drug and is based on competent and reliable scientific evidence. The requirements set forth in [section 355(a) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/a] or in [section 262(a) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262/a] shall not apply to health care economic information provided to such a committee or entity in accordance with this paragraph. Information that is relevant to the substantiation of the health care economic information presented pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available to the Secretary upon request. In this paragraph, the term “health care economic information” means any analysis that identifies, measures, or compares the economic consequences, including the costs of the represented health outcomes, of the use of a drug to the use of another drug, to another health care intervention, or to no intervention.

    (b) __Package form; contents of label__ 

        If in package form unless it bears a label containing (1) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; and (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided, That under clause (2) of this paragraph reasonable variations shall be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (c) __Prominence of information on label__ 

        If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

    (d) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 105–115, title I__  __][/us/pl/105/115/tI]__  __, § 126(b),__  __Nov. 21, 1997__  __,__  __[__  __111 Stat. 2327__  __][/us/stat/111/2327]__ 

    (e) __Designation of drugs or devices by established names__ 

        (1)

            (A)

             If it is a drug, unless its label bears, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical formula)—

                (i) the established name (as defined in subparagraph (3)) of the drug, if there is such a name;

                (ii) the established name and quantity or, if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, the proportion of each active ingredient, including the quantity, kind, and proportion of any alcohol, and also including whether active or not the established name and quantity or if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, the proportion of any bromides, ether, chloroform, acetanilide, acetophenetidin, amidopyrine, antipyrine, atropine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, arsenic, digitalis, digitalis glucosides, mercury, ouabain, strophanthin, strychnine, thyroid, or any derivative or preparation of any such substances, contained therein, except that the requirement for stating the quantity of the active ingredients, other than the quantity of those specifically named in this subclause, shall not apply to nonprescription drugs not intended for human use; and

                (iii) the established name of each inactive ingredient listed in alphabetical order on the outside container of the retail package and, if determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, on the immediate container, as prescribed in regulation promulgated by the Secretary, except that nothing in this subclause shall be deemed to require that any trade secret be divulged, and except that the requirements of this subclause with respect to alphabetical order shall apply only to nonprescription drugs that are not also cosmetics and that this subclause shall not apply to nonprescription drugs not intended for human use.

            (B) For any prescription drug the established name of such drug or ingredient, as the case may be, on such label (and on any labeling on which a name for such drug or ingredient is used) shall be printed prominently and in type at least half as large as that used thereon for any proprietary name or designation for such drug or ingredient, except that to the extent that compliance with the requirements of subclause (ii) or (iii) of clause (A) or this clause is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary.

        (2) If it is a device and it has an established name, unless its label bears, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name, its established name (as defined in subparagraph (4)) prominently printed in type at least half as large as that used thereon for any proprietary name or designation for such device, except that to the extent compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary.

        (3) As used in subparagraph (1), the term “established name”, with respect to a drug or ingredient thereof, means (A) the applicable official name designated pursuant to [section 358 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s358], or (B), if there is no such name and such drug, or such ingredient, is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium, or (C) if neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this subparagraph applies, then the common or usual name, if any, of such drug or of such ingredient, except that where clause (B) of this subparagraph applies to an article recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia and in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia under different official titles, the official title used in the United States Pharmacopeia shall apply unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug, in which case the official title used in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia shall apply.

        (4) As used in subparagraph (2), the term “established name” with respect to a device means (A) the applicable official name of the device designated pursuant to [section 358 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s358], (B) if there is no such name and such device is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium, or (C) if neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this subparagraph applies, then any common or usual name of such device.

    (f) __Directions for use and warnings on label__ 

        Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use; and (2) such adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users, except that where any requirement of clause (1) of this paragraph, as applied to any drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public health, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations exempting such drug or device from such requirement. Required labeling for prescription devices intended for use in health care facilities or by a health care professional and required labeling for in vitro diagnostic devices intended for use by health care professionals or in blood establishments may be made available solely by electronic means, provided that the labeling complies with all applicable requirements of law, and that the manufacturer affords such users the opportunity to request the labeling in paper form, and after such request, promptly provides the requested information without additional cost.

    (g) __Representations as recognized drug; packing and labeling; inconsistent requirements for designation of drug__ 

        If it purports to be a drug the name of which is recognized in an official compendium, unless it is packaged and labeled as prescribed therein. The method of packing may be modified with the consent of the Secretary. Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia with respect to packaging and labeling unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homoeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, and not those of the United States Pharmacopoeia, except that in the event of inconsistency between the requirements of this paragraph and those of paragraph (e) as to the name by which the drug or its ingredients shall be designated, the requirements of paragraph (e) shall prevail.

    (h) __Deteriorative drugs; packing and labeling__ 

        If it has been found by the Secretary to be a drug liable to deterioration, unless it is packaged in such form and manner, and its label bears a statement of such precautions, as the Secretary shall by regulations require as necessary for the protection of the public health. No such regulation shall be established for any drug recognized in an official compendium until the Secretary shall have informed the appropriate body charged with the revision of such compendium of the need for such packaging or labeling requirements and such body shall have failed within a reasonable time to prescribe such requirements.

    (i) __Drug; misleading container; imitation; offer for sale under another name__ 

        (1) If it is a drug and its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading; or (2) if it is an imitation of another drug; or (3) if it is offered for sale under the name of another drug.

    (j) __Health-endangering when used as prescribed__ 

        If it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.

    (k) __, (l) Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 105–115, title I__  __][/us/pl/105/115/tI]__  __, § 125(a)(2)(B), (b)(2)(D),__  __Nov. 21, 1997__  __,__  __[__  __111 Stat. 2325__  __][/us/stat/111/2325]__

> “Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \[Aug. 1, 2005\], the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidance to identify circumstances in which the name of the manufacturer of the original device, a generally recognized abbreviation of such name, or a unique and generally recognized symbol identifying such manufacturer, is not ‘prominent and conspicuous’, as used in section 502(u) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 352(u)][/us/usc/t21/s352/u]\] (as amended by paragraph (1)).”

 __Studies__ 

[Pub. L. 110–85, title IX][/us/pl/110/85/tIX], § 906(b), Sept. 27, 2007, [121 Stat. 950][/us/stat/121/950], provided that:

>     “(1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

>     In the case of direct-to-consumer television advertisements, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Risk Communication under section 567 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 360bbb–6][/us/usc/t21/s360bbb–6]\] (as added by section 917), shall, not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Sept. 27, 2007\], conduct a study to determine if the statement in section 502(n) of such Act \[[21 U.S.C. 352(n)][/us/usc/t21/s352/n]\] (as added by subsection (a)) required with respect to published direct-to-consumer advertisements is appropriate for inclusion in such television advertisements.

>     “(2)  __Content__  __.—__ 

>     As part of the study under paragraph (1), such Secretary shall consider whether the information in the statement described in paragraph (1) would detract from the presentation of risk information in a direct-to-consumer television advertisement. If such Secretary determines the inclusion of such statement is appropriate in direct-to-consumer television advertisements, such Secretary shall issue regulations requiring the implementation of such statement in direct-to-consumer television advertisements, including determining a reasonable length of time for displaying the statement in such advertisements. The Secretary shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress the findings of such study and any plans to issue regulations under this paragraph.”

    [Pub. L. 108–173, title I][/us/pl/108/173/tI], § 107(f), Dec. 8, 2003, [117 Stat. 2171][/us/stat/117/2171], directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to undertake a study of how to make prescription pharmaceutical information, including drug labels and usage instructions, accessible to blind and visually-impaired individuals, and to submit a report to Congress not later than 18 months after Dec. 8, 2003.

[Pub. L. 105–115, title I][/us/pl/105/115/tI], § 114(b), Nov. 21, 1997, [111 Stat. 2312][/us/stat/111/2312], provided that:

 __Counterfeiting of Drugs; Congressional Findings and Declaration of Policy__ 

[Pub. L. 89–74][/us/pl/89/74], § 9(a), July 15, 1965, [79 Stat. 234][/us/stat/79/234], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds and declares that there is a substantial traffic in counterfeit drugs simulating the brand or other identifying mark or device of the manufacturer of the genuine article; that such traffic poses a serious hazard to the health of innocent consumers of such drugs because of the lack of proper qualifications, facilities, and manufacturing controls on the part of the counterfeiter, whose operations are clandestine; that, while such drugs are deemed misbranded within the meaning of section 502(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 352(i)][/us/usc/t21/s352/i]\], the controls for the suppression of the traffic in such drugs are inadequate because of the difficulty of determining the place of interstate origin of such drugs and, if that place is discovered, the fact that the implements for counterfeiting are not subject to seizure, and that these factors require enactment of additional controls with respect to such drugs without regard to their interstate or intrastate origins.”

    Provisions as effective Feb. 1, 1966, see [section 11 of Pub. L. 89–74][/us/pl/89/74/s11], set out as an Effective Date of 1965 Amendment note under [section 321 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s321].
