## § 379r. National uniformity for nonprescription drugs

    (a) __In general__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b), (c)(1), (d), (e), or (f), no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect any requirement—

        (1) that relates to the regulation of a drug that is not subject to the requirements of section 353(b)(1) or 353(f)(1)(A) of this title; and

        (2) that is different from or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with, a requirement under this chapter, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 ([15 U.S.C. 1471][/us/usc/t15/s1471] et seq.), or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act ([15 U.S.C. 1451][/us/usc/t15/s1451] et seq.).

    (b) __Exemption__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Upon application of a State or political subdivision thereof, the Secretary may by regulation, after notice and opportunity for written and oral presentation of views, exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, a State or political subdivision requirement that—

            (A) protects an important public interest that would otherwise be unprotected, including the health and safety of children;

            (B) would not cause any drug to be in violation of any applicable requirement or prohibition under Federal law; and

            (C) would not unduly burden interstate commerce.

        (2) __Timely action__ 

            The Secretary shall make a decision on the exemption of a State or political subdivision requirement under paragraph (1) not later than 120 days after receiving the application of the State or political subdivision under paragraph (1).

    (c) __Scope__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        This section shall not apply to—

            (A) any State or political subdivision requirement that relates to the practice of pharmacy; or

            (B) any State or political subdivision requirement that a drug be dispensed only upon the prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.

        (2) __Safety or effectiveness__ 

            For purposes of subsection (a), a requirement that relates to the regulation of a drug shall be deemed to include any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to a warning of any kind for a drug.

    (d) __Exceptions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of a drug described in subsection (a)(1) that is not the subject of an application approved under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] or [section 357 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s357] (as in effect on the day before November 21, 1997) or a final regulation promulgated by the Secretary establishing conditions under which the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded, subsection (a) shall apply only with respect to a requirement of a State or political subdivision of a State that relates to the same subject as, but is different from or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with—

            (A) a regulation in effect with respect to the drug pursuant to a statute described in subsection (a)(2); or

            (B) any other requirement in effect with respect to the drug pursuant to an amendment to such a statute made on or after November 21, 1997.

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect any action or the liability of any person under the product liability law of any State.
