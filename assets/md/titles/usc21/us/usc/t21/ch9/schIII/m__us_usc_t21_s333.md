            (B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary shall take into consideration whether the responsible person is making efforts toward correcting the violation of the requirement of section 355(o), 355(p), or 355–1 of this title for which the responsible person is subject to such civil penalty.

        (5)

            (A) A civil penalty under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (9) shall be assessed, or a no-tobacco-sale order may be imposed, by the Secretary by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing provided in accordance with this subparagraph and [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554]. Before issuing such an order, the Secretary shall give written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty, or upon whom a no-tobacco-sale order is to be imposed, under such order of the Secretary’s proposal to issue such order and provide such person an opportunity for a hearing on the order. In the course of any investigation, the Secretary may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence that relates to the matter under investigation.

            (B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty, or the period to be covered by a no-tobacco-sale order, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of prior such violations, the degree of culpability, and such other matters as justice may require. A no-tobacco-sale order permanently prohibiting an individual retail outlet from selling tobacco products shall include provisions that allow the outlet, after a specified period of time, to request that the Secretary compromise, modify, or terminate the order.

            (C) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be assessed under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (9).

            (D) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or terminate, with or without conditions, any no-tobacco-sale order.

        (6) Any person who requested, in accordance with paragraph (5)(A), a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty or the imposition of a no-tobacco-sale order and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty or the imposition of a no-tobacco-sale order may file a petition for judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may only be filed within the 60-day period beginning on the date the order making such assessment was issued, or on which the no-tobacco-sale order was imposed, as the case may be.

        (7)

         If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty—

            (A) after the order making the assessment becomes final, and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (6), or

            (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (6) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary,

            the Attorney General shall recover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the expiration of the 60-day period referred to in paragraph (6) or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an action brought in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

        (8) If the Secretary finds that a person has committed repeated violations of restrictions promulgated under [section 387f(d) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s387f/d] at a particular retail outlet then the Secretary may impose a no-tobacco-sale order on that person prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in that outlet. A no-tobacco-sale order may be imposed with a civil penalty under paragraph (1). Prior to the entry of a no-sale order under this paragraph, a person shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to the procedures established through regulations of the Food and Drug Administration for assessing civil money penalties, including at a retailer’s request a hearing by telephone, or at the nearest regional or field office of the Food and Drug Administration, or at a Federal, State, or county facility within 100 miles from the location of the retail outlet, if such a facility is available.

                    (I) not to exceed $250,000 per violation, and not to exceed $1,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding; or

                    (II) in the case of a violation that continues after the Secretary provides written notice to such person, $250,000 for the first 30-day period (or any portion thereof) that the person continues to be in violation, and such amount shall double for every 30-day period thereafter that the violation continues, not to exceed $1,000,000 for any 30-day period, and not to exceed $10,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding.

    (g) __Violations regarding direct-to-consumer advertising__ 

        (1) With respect to a person who is a holder of an approved application under [section 355 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355] for a drug subject to [section 353(b) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s353/b] or under [section 262 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s262], any such person who disseminates or causes another party to disseminate a direct-to-consumer advertisement that is false or misleading shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for the first such violation in any 3-year period, and not to exceed $500,000 for each subsequent violation in any 3-year period. No other civil monetary penalties in this chapter (including the civil penalty in subsection (f)(4)) shall apply to a violation regarding direct-to-consumer advertising. For purposes of this paragraph: (A) Repeated dissemination of the same or similar advertisement prior to the receipt of the written notice referred to in paragraph (2) for such advertisements shall be considered one violation. (B) On and after the date of the receipt of such a notice, all violations under this paragraph occurring in a single day shall be considered one violation. With respect to advertisements that appear in magazines or other publications that are published less frequently than daily, each issue date (whether weekly or monthly) shall be treated as a single day for the purpose of calculating the number of violations under this paragraph.

        (2) A civil penalty under paragraph (1) shall be assessed by the Secretary by an order made on the record after providing written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with this paragraph and [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554]. If upon receipt of the written notice, the person to be assessed a civil penalty objects and requests a hearing, then in the course of any investigation related to such hearing, the Secretary may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence that relates to the matter under investigation, including information pertaining to the factors described in paragraph (3).

        (3)

         The Secretary, in determining the amount of the civil penalty under paragraph (1), shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations, including the following factors:

            (B) Whether the person submitted the advertisement for review if required under section 353c 2 of this title.

            (B) The Secretary may retract or modify any prior comments the Secretary has provided to an advertisement submitted to the Secretary based on new information or changed circumstances, so long as the Secretary provides written notice to the person of the new views of the Secretary on the advertisement and provides a reasonable time for modification or correction of the advertisement prior to seeking any civil penalty under paragraph (1).

        (5) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be assessed under paragraph (1). The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount charged upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owed by the United States to the person charged.

        (6) Any person who requested, in accordance with paragraph (2), a hearing with respect to the assessment of a civil penalty and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty, may file a petition for de novo judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may only be filed within the 60-day period beginning on the date the order making such assessments was issued.

        (7)

         If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty under paragraph (1)—

            (A) after the order making the assessment becomes final, and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (6), or

            (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (6) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary,

 __References in Text__ 

    The Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec. (e)(3), is title II of [Pub. L. 91–513][/us/pl/91/513], Oct. 27, 1970, [84 Stat. 1242][/us/stat/84/1242], which is classified principally to subchapter I (§ 801 et seq.) of chapter 13 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 801 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s801] and Tables.

    [Section 282(j)(5)(C)(ii) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s282/j/5/C/ii], referred to in subsec. (f)(3)(B), was in the original “section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii)”, and was translated as meaning section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress because there is no subsec. (j) of section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act relates to notification of noncompliance with clinical trial information requirements.

    [Section 353c of this title][/us/usc/t21/s353c], referred to in subsec. (g)(3)(B), was in the original a reference to section 503B of act June 25, 1938, and was translated as if it referred to section 503C of that Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 503B as 503C by [Pub. L. 113–54, title I][/us/pl/113/54/tI], § 102(a)(1), Nov. 27, 2013, [127 Stat. 587][/us/stat/127/587], and its transfer to [section 353c of this title][/us/usc/t21/s353c]. A new section 503B, which was enacted by [section 102(a)(2) of Pub. L. 113–54][/us/pl/113/54/s102/a/2], is classified to [section 353b of this title][/us/usc/t21/s353b] and does not relate to television advertisements.
