            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary may, after consultation with the sponsor of an application for an investigational new drug under [section 355(i) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/i], the sponsor of an application for a new drug under [section 355(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/b/1], or the holder of an approved application for a drug under [section 355(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355/b/1], issue to the sponsor or holder a written request for the conduct of pediatric studies for such drug. In issuing such request, the Secretary shall take into account adequate representation of children of ethnic and racial minorities. Such request to conduct pediatric studies shall be in writing and shall include a timeframe for such studies and a request to the sponsor or holder to propose pediatric labeling resulting from such studies. If a request under this subparagraph does not request studies in neonates, such request shall include a statement describing the rationale for not requesting studies in neonates.

            (C) For a drug that is a qualified countermeasure (as defined in [section 247d–6a of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6a]), a security countermeasure (as defined in [section 247d–6b of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6b]), or a qualified pandemic or epidemic product (as defined in [section 247d–6d of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s247d–6d]), in addition to any action with respect to such drug under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Secretary shall notify the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of all pediatric studies in the written request issued by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.

        (2) __Public notice__ 

            The Secretary shall give the public notice of a decision under paragraph (1)(A) not to require an assessment under [section 355c of this title][/us/usc/t21/s355c] and the basis for such decision.

        (3) __Effect of subsection__ 

            Nothing in this subsection alters or amends [section 331(j) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s331/j] or [section 552 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552] or [section 1905 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1905].
