    (a) __General rule__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement—

    (b) __Exempt requirements__ 

    Upon application of a State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary may, by regulation promulgated after notice and opportunity for an oral hearing, exempt from subsection (a) of this section, under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, a requirement of such State or political subdivision applicable to a device intended for human use if—

        (1) the requirement is more stringent than a requirement under this chapter which would be applicable to the device if an exemption were not in effect under this subsection; or

        (2)

         the requirement—

            (A) is required by compelling local conditions, and

            (B) compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under this chapter.
