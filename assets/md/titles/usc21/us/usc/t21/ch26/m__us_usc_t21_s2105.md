## § 2105. Enhanced aquaculture and seafood inspection

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress finds the following:

        (1) In 2007, there has been an overwhelming increase in the volume of aquaculture and seafood that has been found to contain substances that are not approved for use in food in the United States.

        (2) As of May 2007, inspection programs are not able to satisfactorily accomplish the goals of ensuring the food safety of the United States.

        (3) To protect the health and safety of consumers in the United States, the ability of the Secretary to perform inspection functions must be enhanced.

    (b) __Heightened inspections__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to enhance, as necessary, the inspection regime of the Food and Drug Administration for aquaculture and seafood, consistent with obligations of the United States under international agreements and United States law.

    (c) __Report to Congress__ 

    Not later than 180 days after September 27, 2007, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that—

        (1) describes the specifics of the aquaculture and seafood inspection program;

        (2) describes the feasibility of developing a traceability system for all catfish and seafood products, both domestic and imported, for the purpose of identifying the processing plant of origin of such products; and

        (3) provides for an assessment of the risks associated with particular contaminants and banned substances.

    (d) __Partnerships with States__ 

        Upon the request by any State, the Secretary may enter into partnership agreements, as soon as practicable after the request is made, to implement inspection programs to Federal standards regarding the importation of aquaculture and seafood.
