## § 2107. Sense of Congress

    It is the sense of Congress that—

    (1) it is vital for Congress to provide the Food and Drug Administration with additional resources, authorities, and direction with respect to ensuring the safety of the food supply of the United States;

    (2) additional inspectors are required to improve the Food and Drug Administration’s ability to safeguard the food supply of the United States;

    (3) because of the increasing volume of international trade in food products the Secretary should make it a priority to enter into agreements with the trading partners of the United States with respect to food safety; and

    (4) Congress should work to develop a comprehensive response to the issue of food safety.
