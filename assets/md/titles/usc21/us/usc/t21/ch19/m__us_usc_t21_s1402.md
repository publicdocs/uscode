        (2) In the case of a foreign country with which the Secretary is unable to enter into an agreement under subsection (a) of this section or for which the information provided under paragraph (1) is insufficient to assure an effective pesticide monitoring program, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, obtain the information described in paragraph (1) with respect to such country from other Federal or international agencies or private sources.
