Such report shall include a description of the following:

            (A) Analysis of the need for further regulations or guidance to industry.

            (B) Outreach to food industry sectors, including through the Food and Agriculture Coordinating Councils referred to in [section 2203 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s2203], to identify potential sources of emerging threats to the safety and security of the food supply and preventive strategies to address those threats.

            (C) Systems to ensure the prompt distribution to the food industry of information and technical assistance concerning preventive strategies.

            (D) Communication systems to ensure that information about specific threats to the safety and security of the food supply are rapidly and effectively disseminated.

            (E) Surveillance systems and laboratory networks to rapidly detect and respond to foodborne illness outbreaks and other food-related hazards, including how such systems and networks are integrated.

            (F) Outreach, education, and training provided to States and local governments to build State and local food safety and food defense capabilities, including progress implementing strategies developed under sections 2202 and 2224 of this title.

            (G) The estimated resources needed to effectively implement the programs and practices identified in the report developed in this section over a 5-year period.

The Secretary shall promptly undertake those risk-based actions that are identified during the development of the report as likely to contribute to the safety and security of the food supply.

    (c) __Capability for laboratory analyses; research__ 

        The report developed under subsection (a)(1) shall provide a description of methods to increase capacity to undertake analyses of food samples promptly after collection, to identify new and rapid analytical techniques, including commercially-available techniques that can be employed at ports of entry and by Food Emergency Response Network laboratories, and to provide for well-equipped and staffed laboratory facilities and progress toward laboratory accreditation under [section 350k of this title][/us/usc/t21/s350k] (as added by section 202).2
