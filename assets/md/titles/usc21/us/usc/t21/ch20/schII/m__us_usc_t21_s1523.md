 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 812 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s812], referred to in par. (9)(A), was in the original “section 112 of the Controlled Substances Act ([21 U.S.C. 812][/us/usc/t21/s812])”, and was translated as reading “section 202”, meaning [section 202 of Pub. L. 91–513][/us/pl/91/513/s202], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 91–513][/us/pl/91/513] does not contain a section 112.
