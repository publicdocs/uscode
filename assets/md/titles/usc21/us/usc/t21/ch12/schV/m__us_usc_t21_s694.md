 __References in Text__ 

    This Act, referred to in text, is [act June 30, 1906, ch. 3913][/us/act/1906-06-30/ch3913], [34 Stat. 669][/us/stat/34/669], which made appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1907.

 __Codification__ 

    Section 2 of act June 26, 1934, which was classified to section 725a of former Title 31, Money and Finance, repealed the permanent appropriation under the title “Meat inspection, Bureau of Animal Industry (fiscal year) (3–114)” effective July 1, 1935, provided that such portions of any Acts as make permanent appropriations to be expended under such account are amended so as to authorize, in lieu thereof, annual appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury in identical terms and in such amounts as now provided by the laws providing such permanent appropriations, and authorized, in addition thereto, the appropriation of “such other sums as may be necessary in the enforcement of the meat inspection laws.” In the original, the parenthetical “(U.S.C., title 21, secs. 71 to 96, inclusive)” followed the phrase “meat inspection laws”. The “meat inspection laws” are classified generally to this chapter.

    Section was not enacted as part of the Federal Meat Inspection Act which is classified to subchapters I to IV–A of this chapter.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 95 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s95].
