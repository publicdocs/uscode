## § 824. Denial, revocation, or suspension of registration

    (a) __Grounds__ 

    A registration pursuant to [section 823 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823] to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance or a list I chemical may be suspended or revoked by the Attorney General upon a finding that the registrant—

        (1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II;

        (2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II or any other law of the United States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance or a list I chemical;

        (3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or list I chemicals or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his registration recommended by competent State authority;

        (4) has committed such acts as would render his registration under [section 823 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823] inconsistent with the public interest as determined under such section; or

        (5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to [section 1320a–7(a) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7/a].

        A registration pursuant to [section 823(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823/g/1] to dispense a narcotic drug for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment may be suspended or revoked by the Attorney General upon a finding that the registrant has failed to comply with any standard referred to in [section 823(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823/g/1].

    (b) __Limits of revocation or suspension__ 

        The Attorney General may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance or list I chemical with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.

    (c) __Service of show cause order; proceedings__ 

        (1) Before taking action pursuant to this section, or pursuant to a denial of registration under [section 823 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823], the Attorney General shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an order to show cause why registration should not be denied, revoked, or suspended.

        (2)

         An order to show cause under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A) contain a statement of the basis for the denial, revocation, or suspension, including specific citations to any laws or regulations alleged to be violated by the applicant or registrant;

            (B) direct the applicant or registrant to appear before the Attorney General at a time and place stated in the order, but not less than 30 days after the date of receipt of the order; and

            (C) notify the applicant or registrant of the opportunity to submit a corrective action plan on or before the date of appearance.

        (3) Upon review of any corrective action plan submitted by an applicant or registrant pursuant to paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall determine whether denial, revocation, or suspension proceedings should be discontinued, or deferred for the purposes of modification, amendment, or clarification to such plan.

        (4) Proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend shall be conducted pursuant to this section in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. Such proceedings shall be independent of, and not in lieu of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings under this subchapter or any other law of the United States.

        (5) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the issuance of an immediate suspension order under subsection (d).

    (d) __Suspension of registration in cases of imminent danger__ 

        (1) The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend any registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings under this section, in cases where he finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety. A failure to comply with a standard referred to in [section 823(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823/g/1] may be treated under this subsection as grounds for immediate suspension of a registration granted under such section. A suspension under this subsection shall continue in effect until the conclusion of such proceedings, including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Attorney General or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.

        (2) In this subsection, the phrase “imminent danger to the public health or safety” means that, due to the failure of the registrant to maintain effective controls against diversion or otherwise comply with the obligations of a registrant under this subchapter or subchapter II, there is a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the absence of an immediate suspension of the registration.

    (e) __Suspension and revocation of quotas__ 

        The suspension or revocation of a registration under this section shall operate to suspend or revoke any quota applicable under [section 826 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s826].

    (f) __Disposition of controlled substances or list I chemicals__ 

        In the event the Attorney General suspends or revokes a registration granted under [section 823 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s823], all controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or possessed by the registrant pursuant to such registration at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation order, as the case may be, may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be placed under seal. No disposition may be made of any controlled substances or list I chemicals under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded except that a court, upon application therefor, may at any time order the sale of perishable controlled substances or list I chemicals. Any such order shall require the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all such controlled substances or list I chemicals (or proceeds of sale deposited in court) shall be forfeited to the United States; and the Attorney General shall dispose of such controlled substances or list I chemicals in accordance with [section 881(e) of this title][/us/usc/t21/s881/e]. All right, title, and interest in such controlled substances or list I chemicals shall vest in the United States upon a revocation order becoming final.

    (g) __Seizure or placement under seal of controlled substances or list I chemicals__ 

        The Attorney General may, in his discretion, seize or place under seal any controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who has ceased to practice or do business in the manner contemplated by his registration. Such controlled substances or list I chemicals shall be held for the benefit of the registrant, or his successor in interest. The Attorney General shall notify a registrant, or his successor in interest, who has any controlled substance or list I chemical seized or placed under seal of the procedures to be followed to secure the return of the controlled substance or list I chemical and the conditions under which it will be returned. The Attorney General may not dispose of any controlled substance or list I chemical seized or placed under seal under this subsection until the expiration of one hundred and eighty days from the date such substance or chemical was seized or placed under seal.
