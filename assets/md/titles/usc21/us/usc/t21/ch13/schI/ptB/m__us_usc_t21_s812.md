## § 812. Schedules of controlled substances

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        There are established five schedules of controlled substances, to be known as schedules I, II, III, IV, and V. Such schedules shall initially consist of the substances listed in this section. The schedules established by this section shall be updated and republished on a semiannual basis during the two-year period beginning one year after October 27, 1970, and shall be updated and republished on an annual basis thereafter.

    (b) __Placement on schedules; findings required__ 

    Except where control is required by United States obligations under an international treaty, convention, or protocol, in effect on October 27, 1970, and except in the case of an immediate precursor, a drug or other substance may not be placed in any schedule unless the findings required for such schedule are made with respect to such drug or other substance. The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:

        (1) __Schedule I.—__ 

            (A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.

            (B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

            (C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.

        (2) __Schedule II.—__ 

            (A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.

            (B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.

            (C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.

        (3) __Schedule III.—__ 

            (A) The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.

            (B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

            (C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.

        (4) __Schedule IV.—__ 

            (A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.

            (B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

            (C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.

        (5) __Schedule V.—__ 

            (A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.

            (B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

            (C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.

> “SEC. 2. __FINDINGS.__ 

> “Congress finds as follows:

>     “(1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X, Liquid Ecstasy, Grievous Bodily Harm, Georgia Home Boy, Scoop) has become a significant and growing problem in law enforcement. At least 20 States have scheduled such drug in their drug laws and law enforcement officials have been experiencing an increased presence of the drug in driving under the influence, sexual assault, and overdose cases especially at night clubs and parties.

>     “(2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma hydroxybutyric acid (‘GHB’) is being used in conjunction with alcohol and other drugs with detrimental effects in an increasing number of cases. It is difficult to isolate the impact of such drug’s ingestion since it is so typically taken with an ever-changing array of other drugs and especially alcohol which potentiates its impact.

>     “(3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, processes via alcohol dehydrogenase, and its symptoms at high levels of intake and as impact builds are comparable to alcohol ingestion/intoxication. Thus, aggression and violence can be expected in some individuals who use such drug.

>     “(4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone and 1.4-butanediol are swiftly converted by the body into GHB. Illicit use of these and other GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a significant and growing law enforcement problem.

>     “(5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma hydroxybutyric acid is being developed as a treatment for cataplexy, a serious and debilitating disease. Cataplexy, which causes sudden and total loss of muscle control, affects about 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 Americans with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. People with cataplexy often are unable to work, drive a car, hold their children or live a normal life.

>     “(6) Abuse of illicit GHB is an imminent hazard to public safety that requires immediate regulatory action under the Controlled Substances Act ([21 U.S.C. 801][/us/usc/t21/s801] et seq.).

>         The Congress finds that the abuse of illicit gamma hydroxybutyric acid is an imminent hazard to the public safety. Accordingly, the Attorney General, notwithstanding sections 201(a), 201(b), 201(c), and 202 of the Controlled Substances Act \[[21 U.S.C. 811(a)][/us/usc/t21/s811/a]–(c), 812\], shall issue, not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Feb. 18, 2000\], a final order that schedules such drug (together with its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers) in the same schedule under section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act as would apply to a scheduling of a substance by the Attorney General under section 201(h)(1) of such Act (relating to imminent hazards to the public safety), except as follows:

>             “(A) For purposes of any requirements that relate to the physical security of registered manufacturers and registered distributors, the final order shall treat such drug, when the drug is manufactured, distributed, or possessed in accordance with an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 355(i)][/us/usc/t21/s355/i]\] (whether the exemption involved is authorized before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Feb. 18, 2000\]), as being in the same schedule as that recommended by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the drug when the drug is the subject of an authorized investigational new drug application (relating to such section 505(i)). The recommendation referred to in the preceding sentence is contained in the first paragraph of the letter transmitted on May 19, 1999, by such Secretary (acting through the Assistant Secretary for Health) to the Attorney General (acting through the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration), which letter was in response to the letter transmitted by the Attorney General (acting through such Deputy Administrator) on September 16, 1997. In publishing the final order in the Federal Register, the Attorney General shall publish a copy of the letter that was transmitted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

>             “(B) In the case of gamma hydroxybutyric acid that is contained in a drug product for which an application is approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 355][/us/usc/t21/s355]\] (whether the application involved is approved before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Feb. 18, 2000\]), the final order shall schedule such drug in the same schedule as that recommended by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for authorized formulations of the drug. The recommendation referred to in the preceding sentence is contained in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the letter referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to May 19, 1999.

>         “(2) __Failure to issue order.—__ 

>         If the final order is not issued within the period specified in paragraph (1), gamma hydroxybutyric acid (together with its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers) is deemed to be scheduled under section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act \[[21 U.S.C. 812(c)][/us/usc/t21/s812/c]\] in accordance with the policies described in paragraph (1), as if the Attorney General had issued a final order in accordance with such paragraph.”
