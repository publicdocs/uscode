 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 111–211][/us/pl/111/211] inserted “, tribal,” after “State” in introductory provisions.

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–570][/us/pl/99/570] and [Pub. L. 99–646][/us/pl/99/646] amended section substantially identically designating existing provisions as subsec. (a) and adding subsec. (b), with the exception of the amendment of subsec. (a) for which [Pub. L. 99–570][/us/pl/99/570] directed the insertion of “or (with respect to offenses under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter) any State or local law enforcement officer” and [Pub. L. 99–646][/us/pl/99/646] directed the insertion of “or any State or local law enforcement officer”, the latter of which was executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
