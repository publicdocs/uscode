## § 829. Prescriptions

    (a) __Schedule II substances__ 

        Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\], may be dispensed without the written prescription of a practitioner, except that in emergency situations, as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation after consultation with the Attorney General, such drug may be dispensed upon oral prescription in accordance with section 503(b) of that Act \[[21 U.S.C. 353(b)][/us/usc/t21/s353/b]\]. Prescriptions shall be retained in conformity with the requirements of [section 827 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s827]. No prescription for a controlled substance in schedule II may be refilled.

    (b) __Schedule III and IV substances__ 

        Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\], may be dispensed without a written or oral prescription in conformity with section 503(b) of that Act \[[21 U.S.C. 353(b)][/us/usc/t21/s353/b]\]. Such prescriptions may not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times after the date of the prescription unless renewed by the practitioner.

    (c) __Schedule V substances__ 

        No controlled substance in schedule V which is a drug may be distributed or dispensed other than for a medical purpose.

    (d) __Non-prescription drugs with abuse potential__ 

        Whenever it appears to the Attorney General that a drug not considered to be a prescription drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] should be so considered because of its abuse potential, he shall so advise the Secretary and furnish to him all available data relevant thereto.

    (e) __Controlled substances dispensed by means of the Internet__ 

        (1) No controlled substance that is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] may be delivered, distributed, or dispensed by means of the Internet without a valid prescription.

    (f) __Partial fills of schedule II controlled substances__

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), remaining portions of a partially filled prescription for a controlled substance in schedule II—

                (i) may be filled; and

                (ii) shall be filled not later than 30 days after the date on which the prescription is written.
