## § 829. Prescriptions

    (a) __Schedule II substances__ 

        Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\], may be dispensed without the written prescription of a practitioner, except that in emergency situations, as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation after consultation with the Attorney General, such drug may be dispensed upon oral prescription in accordance with section 503(b) of that Act \[[21 U.S.C. 353(b)][/us/usc/t21/s353/b]\]. Prescriptions shall be retained in conformity with the requirements of [section 827 of this title][/us/usc/t21/s827]. No prescription for a controlled substance in schedule II may be refilled.

    (b) __Schedule III and IV substances__ 

        Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\], may be dispensed without a written or oral prescription in conformity with section 503(b) of that Act \[[21 U.S.C. 353(b)][/us/usc/t21/s353/b]\]. Such prescriptions may not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times after the date of the prescription unless renewed by the practitioner.

    (c) __Schedule V substances__ 

        No controlled substance in schedule V which is a drug may be distributed or dispensed other than for a medical purpose.

    (d) __Non-prescription drugs with abuse potential__ 

        Whenever it appears to the Attorney General that a drug not considered to be a prescription drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] should be so considered because of its abuse potential, he shall so advise the Secretary and furnish to him all available data relevant thereto.

    (e) __Controlled substances dispensed by means of the Internet__ 

        (1) No controlled substance that is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.\] may be delivered, distributed, or dispensed by means of the Internet without a valid prescription.

        (2)

         As used in this subsection:

                (ii) a covering practitioner.

            (B)

                (i) The term “in-person medical evaluation” means a medical evaluation that is conducted with the patient in the physical presence of the practitioner, without regard to whether portions of the evaluation are conducted by other health professionals.

                (ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to imply that 1 in-person medical evaluation demonstrates that a prescription has been issued for a legitimate medical purpose within the usual course of professional practice.

            (C)

             The term “covering practitioner” means, with respect to a patient, a practitioner who conducts a medical evaluation (other than an in-person medical evaluation) at the request of a practitioner who—

                (i) has conducted at least 1 in-person medical evaluation of the patient or an evaluation of the patient through the practice of telemedicine, within the previous 24 months; and

                (ii) is temporarily unavailable to conduct the evaluation of the patient.

        (3)

         Nothing in this subsection shall apply to—

            (A) the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance by a practitioner engaged in the practice of telemedicine; or
