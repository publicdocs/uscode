    The Secretary of Agriculture, in carrying out regulations prohibiting or restricting the entry of materials that may harbor pests, or diseases, is authorized to enter into agreements with operators or owners of vessels or aircraft for the purpose of providing inspection services at points of entry in the United States in addition to the regular or on-call basis currently available in connection with such vessels or aircraft.
