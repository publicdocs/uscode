## § 745. Treatment of accounts

    (a) Accounts held by the debtor for a particular customer in separate capacities shall be treated as accounts of separate customers.

    (b) If a stockbroker or a bank holds a customer net equity claim against the debtor that arose out of a transaction for a customer of such stockbroker or bank, each such customer of such stockbroker or bank shall be treated as a separate customer of the debtor.

    (c) Each trustee’s account specified as such on the debtor’s books, and supported by a trust deed filed with, and qualified as such by, the Internal Revenue Service, and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, shall be treated as a separate customer account for each beneficiary under such trustee account.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2613][/us/stat/92/2613]; [Pub. L. 97–222][/us/pl/97/222], § 11, July 27, 1982, [96 Stat. 238][/us/stat/96/238]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III][/us/pl/98/353/tIII], § 483, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 383][/us/stat/98/383]; [Pub. L. 103–394, title V][/us/pl/103/394/tV], § 501(d)(28), Oct. 22, 1994, [108 Stat. 4146][/us/stat/108/4146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Section 745(a) indicates that each account held by a customer in a separate capacity is to be considered a separate account. This prevents the offset of accounts held in different capacities.

    Subsection (b) indicates that a bank or another stockbroker that is a customer of a debtor is considered to hold its customers accounts in separate capacities. Thus a bank or other stockbroker is not treated as a mutual fund for purposes of bulk investment. This protects unrelated customers of a bank or other stockholder from having their accounts offset.

    Subsection (c) effects the same result with respect to a trust so that each beneficiary is treated as the customer of the debtor rather than the trust itself. This eliminates any doubt whether a trustee holds a personal account in a separate capacity from his trustee’s account.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, referred to in subsec. (c), is classified generally to Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.
