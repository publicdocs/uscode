## § 702. Election of trustee

    (a)

     A creditor may vote for a candidate for trustee only if such creditor—

        (1) holds an allowable, undisputed, fixed, liquidated, unsecured claim of a kind entitled to distribution under section 726(a)(2), 726(a)(3), 726(a)(4), 752(a), 766(h), or 766(i) of this title;

        (2) does not have an interest materially adverse, other than an equity interest that is not substantial in relation to such creditor’s interest as a creditor, to the interest of creditors entitled to such distribution; and

        (3) is not an insider.

    (b) At the meeting of creditors held under [section 341 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s341], creditors may elect one person to serve as trustee in the case if election of a trustee is requested by creditors that may vote under subsection (a) of this section, and that hold at least 20 percent in amount of the claims specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that may vote under subsection (a) of this section.

    (c)

     A candidate for trustee is elected trustee if—

        (1) creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of the claims of a kind specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that may vote under subsection (a) of this section vote; and

        (2) such candidate receives the votes of creditors holding a majority in amount of claims specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that vote for a trustee.

    (d) If a trustee is not elected under this section, then the interim trustee shall serve as trustee in the case.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2604][/us/stat/92/2604]; [Pub. L. 97–222][/us/pl/97/222], § 7, July 27, 1982, [96 Stat. 237][/us/stat/96/237]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III][/us/pl/98/353/tIII], § 472, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 380][/us/stat/98/380].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    The House amendment adopts section 702(a)(2) of the Senate amendment. An insubstantial equity interest does not disqualify a creditor from voting for a candidate for trustee.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Subsection (a) of this section specifies which creditors may vote for a trustee. Only a creditor that holds an allowable, undisputed, fixed, liquidated, unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority, that does not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of general unsecured creditors, and that is not an insider may vote for a trustee. The phrase “materially adverse” is currently used in the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, rule 207(d). The application of the standard requires a balancing of various factors, such as the nature of the adversity. A creditor with a very small equity position would not be excluded from voting solely because he holds a small equity in the debtor. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure also currently provide for temporary allowance of claims, and will continue to do so for the purposes of determining who is eligible to vote under this provision.

    Subsection (b) permits creditors at the meeting of creditors to elect one person to serve as trustee in the case. Creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of the claims specified in the preceding paragraph must request election before creditors may elect a trustee. Subsection (c) specifies that a candidate for trustee is elected trustee if creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of those claims actually vote, and if the candidate receives a majority in amount of votes actually cast.

    Subsection (d) specifies that if a trustee is not elected, then the interim trustee becomes the permanent trustee and serves in the case permanently.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 472(a), inserted “held” after “meeting of creditors”.

    Subsec. (c)(1). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 472(b)(1), inserted “of a kind” after “claims”.

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 472(b)(2), substituted “for a trustee” for “for trustee”.

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 472(c), substituted “this section” for “subsection (c) of this section”.

    1982—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 97–222][/us/pl/97/222] substituted “726(a)(4), 752(a), 766(h), or 766(i)” for “or 726(a)(4)”.

 __Effective Date of 1984 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] effective with respect to cases filed 90 days after July 10, 1984, see [section 552(a) of Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353/s552/a], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s101].
