## § 721. Authorization to operate business

    The court may authorize the trustee to operate the business of the debtor for a limited period, if such operation is in the best interest of the estate and consistent with the orderly liquidation of the estate.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2606][/us/stat/92/2606].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section is derived from section 2a(5) of the Bankruptcy Act \[section 11(a)(5) of former title 11\]. It permits the court to authorize the operation of any business of the debtor for a limited period, if the operation is in the best interest of the estate and consistent with orderly liquidation of the estate. An example is the operation of a watch company to convert watch movements and cases into completed watches which will bring much higher prices than the component parts would have brought.
