## § 742. Effect of [section 362 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s362] in this subchapter

    Notwithstanding [section 362 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s362], SIPC may file an application for a protective decree under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. The filing of such application stays all proceedings in the case under this title unless and until such application is dismissed. If SIPC completes the liquidation of the debtor, then the court shall dismiss the case.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2613][/us/stat/92/2613]; [Pub. L. 97–222, § 9][/us/pl/97/222/s9], July 27, 1982, [96 Stat. 237][/us/stat/96/237]; [Pub. L. 103–394, title V, § 501(d)(26)][/us/pl/103/394/s501/d/26], Oct. 22, 1994, [108 Stat. 4146][/us/stat/108/4146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 742 of the House amendment deletes a sentence contained in the Senate amendment requiring the trustee in an interstate stock-brokerage liquidation to comply with the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 7 if the debtor is also a commodity broker. The House amendment expands the requirement to require the SIPC trustee to perform such duties, if the debtor is a commodity broker, under section 7(b) of the Securities Investor Protection Act \[[15 U.S.C. 78ggg(b)][/us/usc/t15/s78ggg/b]\]. The requirement is deleted from section 742 since the trustee of an intrastate stockbroker will be bound by the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 7 if the debtor is also a commodity broker by reason of [section 103 of title 11][/us/usc/t11/s103].

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Section 742 indicates that the automatic stay does not prevent SIPC from filing an application for a protective decree under SIPA. If SIPA does file such an application, then all bankruptcy proceedings are suspended until the SIPC action is completed. If SIPC completes liquidation of the stockbroker then the bankruptcy case is dismissed.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, referred to in text, is [Pub. L. 91–598][/us/pl/91/598], Dec. 30, 1970, [84 Stat. 1636][/us/stat/84/1636], as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 2B–1 (§ 78aaa et seq.) of Title 15, Commerce and Trade. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see [section 78aaa of Title 15][/us/usc/t15/s78aaa] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–394][/us/pl/103/394] struck out “([15 U.S.C. 78aaa][/us/usc/t15/s78aaa] et seq.)” after “Act of 1970”.

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–222][/us/pl/97/222] substituted “title” for “chapter” after “all proceedings in the case under this”.
