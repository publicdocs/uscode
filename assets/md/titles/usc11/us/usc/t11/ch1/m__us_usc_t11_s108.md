## § 108. Extension of time

    (a)

     If applicable nonbankruptcy law, an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding, or an agreement fixes a period within which the debtor may commence an action, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, the trustee may commence such action only before the later of—

        (1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or

        (2) two years after the order for relief.

    (b)

     Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, if applicable nonbankruptcy law, an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding, or an agreement fixes a period within which the debtor or an individual protected under section 1201 or 1301 of this title may file any pleading, demand, notice, or proof of claim or loss, cure a default, or perform any other similar act, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, the trustee may only file, cure, or perform, as the case may be, before the later of—

        (1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or

        (2) 60 days after the order for relief.

    (c)

     Except as provided in [section 524 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s524], if applicable nonbankruptcy law, an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding, or an agreement fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than a bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor, or against an individual with respect to which such individual is protected under section 1201 or 1301 of this title, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of—

        (1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or

        (2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362, 922, 1201, or 1301 of this title, as the case may be, with respect to such claim.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2556][/us/stat/92/2556]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III][/us/pl/98/353/tIII], § 424, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 369][/us/stat/98/369]; [Pub. L. 99–554, title II][/us/pl/99/554/tII], § 257(b), Oct. 27, 1986, [100 Stat. 3114][/us/stat/100/3114]; [Pub. L. 109–8, title XII][/us/pl/109/8/tXII], § 1203, Apr. 20, 2005, [119 Stat. 193][/us/stat/119/193].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Extension of time: The House amendment adopts section 108(c)(1) of the Senate amendment which expressly includes any special suspensions of statutes of limitation periods on collection outside bankruptcy when assets are under the authority of a court. For example, section 6503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code \[title 26\] suspends collection of tax liabilities while the debtor’s assets are in the control or custody of a court, and for 6 months thereafter. By adopting the language of the Senate amendment, the House amendment insures not only that the period for collection of the taxes outside bankruptcy will not expire during the title 11 proceedings, but also that such period will not expire until at least 6 months thereafter, which is the minimum suspension period provided by the Internal Revenue Code \[title 26\].

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Subsections (a) and (b), derived from Bankruptcy Act section 11 \[section 29 of former title 11\], permit the trustee, when he steps into the shoes of the debtor, an extension of time for filing an action or doing some other act that is required to preserve the debtor’s rights. Subsection (a) extends any statute of limitation for commencing or continuing an action by the debtor for two years after the date of the order for relief, unless it would expire later. Subsection (b) gives the trustee 60 days to take other actions not covered under subsection (a), such as filing a pleading, demand, notice, or proof of claim or loss (such as an insurance claim), unless the period for doing the relevant act expires later than 60 days after the date of the order for relief.

    Subsection (c) extends the statute of limitations for creditors. Thus, if a creditor is stayed from commencing or continuing an action against the debtor because of the bankruptcy case, then the creditor is permitted an additional 30 days after notice of the event by which the stay is terminated, whether that event be relief from the automatic stay under proposed [11 U.S.C. 362][/us/usc/t11/s362] or 1301, the closing of the bankruptcy case (which terminates the stay), or the exception from discharge of the debts on which the creditor claims.

    In the case of Federal tax liabilities, the Internal Revenue Code \[title 26\] suspends the statute of limitations on a tax liability of a taxpayer from running while his assets are in the control or custody of a court and for 6 months thereafter (sec. 6503(b) of the Code \[title 26\]). The amendment applies this rule in a title 11 proceeding. Accordingly, the statute of limitations on collection of a nondischargeable Federal tax liability of a debtor will resume running after 6 months following the end of the period during which the debtor’s assets are in the control or custody of the bankruptcy court. This rule will provide the Internal Revenue Service adequate time to collect nondischargeable taxes following the end of the title 11 proceedings.
