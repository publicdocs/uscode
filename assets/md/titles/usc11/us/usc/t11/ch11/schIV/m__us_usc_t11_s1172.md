## § 1172. Contents of plan

    (a)

     In addition to the provisions required or permitted under [section 1123 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s1123], a plan—

        (1) shall specify the extent to and the means by which the debtor’s rail service is proposed to be continued, and the extent to which any of the debtor’s rail service is proposed to be terminated; and

        (2)

         may include a provision for—

            (A) the transfer of any or all of the operating railroad lines of the debtor to another operating railroad; or

            (B) abandonment of any railroad line in accordance with [section 1170 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s1170].

    (b) If, except for the pendency of the case under this chapter, transfer of, or operation of or over, any of the debtor’s rail lines by an entity other than the debtor or a successor to the debtor under the plan would require approval by the Board under a law of the United States, then a plan may not propose such a transfer or such operation unless the proponent of the plan initiates an appropriate application for such a transfer or such operation with the Board and, within such time as the court may fix, not exceeding 180 days, the Board, with or without a hearing, as the Board may determine, and with or without modification or condition, approves such application, or does not act on such application. Any action or order of the Board approving, modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5.

    (c)

        (1) In approving an application under subsection (b) of this section, the Board shall require the rail carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that established under [section 11326(a) of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s11326/a].

        (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to affect the priorities or timing of payment of employee protection which might have existed in the absence of this subsection.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 1172 of the House amendment is derived from section 1171 of the House bill in preference to section 1170 of the Senate amendment with the exception that section 1170(4) of the Senate amendment is incorporated into section 1172(a)(1) of the House amendment.

    Section 1172(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 1171(c) of the Senate amendment. The section gives the Interstate Commerce Commission the exclusive power to approve or disapprove the transfer of, or operation of or over, any of the debtor’s rail lines over which the Commission has jurisdiction, subject to review under the Administrative Procedures Act \[[5 U.S.C. 551][/us/usc/t5/s551] et seq. and 701 et seq.\]. The section does not apply to a transfer of railroad lines to a successor of the debtor under a plan of reorganization by merger or otherwise.

    The House amendment deletes section 1171(a) of the Senate amendment as a matter to be determined by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It is anticipated that the rules will specify the period of time, such as 18 months, within which a trustee must file with the court a proposed plan of reorganization for the debtor or a report why a plan cannot be formulated. Incorporation by reference of section 1121 in [section 1161 of title 11][/us/usc/t11/s1161] means that a party in interest will also have a right to file a plan of reorganization. This differs from the position taken in the Senate amendment which would have permitted the Interstate Commerce Commission to file a plan of reorganization.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Section 1170 adds to the general provisions required or permitted in reorganization plans by section 1123. Subsection (1) requires that a reorganization plan under the railroad subchapter specify the means by which the value of the claims of creditors and the interests of equity holders which are materially and adversely affected by the plan are to be realized. Subsection (2) permits a plan to include provisions for the issuance of warrants. Subsection (3) requires that the plan provide for fixed charges by probable earnings for their payment. Subsection (4) requires that the plan specify the means by which, and the extent to which, the debtor’s rail service is to be continued, and shall identify any rail service to be terminated. Subsection (5) permits other appropriate provisions not inconsistent with the chapter. With the exception of subsection (4), the requirements are comparable to those of present section 77(b) \[section 205(b) of former title 11\]; subsection (4) emphasizes the public interest in the preservation of rail transportation.

    Section 1171 imposes on the court, rather than the Interstate Commerce Commission, as in present section 77 \[section 205 of former title 11\], the responsibility for the plan of reorganization. The Commission is empowered to make final decisions subject only to review by the court under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act \[[5 U.S.C. 551][/us/usc/t5/s551] et seq. and 701 et seq.\] as to any part of the plan which deals with transportation matters, such as the grant of operating rights of or over, or transfer of, the debtor’s rail lines to other carriers.

    Subsection (a) requires the trustee to file a plan of reorganization within 18 months after the petition is filed, and permits the court, for good cause shown, to extend such time limit. Subsection (b) permits a plan to be proposed by any interested person, and permits the trustee to revise his plan at any time before it is approved by the court.

    Subsections (c), (d) and (e) require the court, when a plan is submitted by the trustee or, if the court deems it worthy of consideration, a plan submitted is proposed by any other person proposes the transfer of, or operation of or over, any of the debtor’s lines by other carriers, to refer to such provisions of the plan to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Commission, within 240 days, and after a hearing if the Commission so determines, is to report to the court the effects of such provisions of the plan in the light of national transportation policy and sections 5(3)(f)(A), (B), and (D), (F)–(I) of the Interstate Commerce Act \[[49 U.S.C. 11350(b)(1)][/us/usc/t49/s11350/b/1], (2), (4), (6)–(9)\]. The report of the Commission is conclusive in all further hearings on the plan by the court, subject only to review pursuant to [5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)][/us/usc/t5/s706/2/A]–(D).

 __house report no. 95–595__ 

    \[Section 1171 (enacted as section 1172)\] A plan in a railroad reorganization case may include provisions in addition to those required and permitted under an ordinary reorganization plan. It may provide for the transfer of any or all of the operating railroad lines of the debtor to another operating railroad.

    Paragraph (1) contemplates a liquidating plan for the debtor’s rail lines, much as occurred in the Penn Central case by transfer of operating lines to ConRail. Such a liquidating plan is not per se contrary to the public interest, and the court will have to determine on a case-by-case basis, with the guidance of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of other parties in interest, whether the particular plan proposed is in the public interest, as required under proposed [11 U.S.C. 1172(3)][/us/usc/t11/s1172/3].

    The plan may also provide for abandonment in accordance with section 1169, governing abandonment generally. Neither of these provisions in a plan, transfer or abandonment of lines, requires ICC approval. Confirmation of the plan by the court authorizes the debtor to comply with the plan in accordance with section 1142(a) notwithstanding any bankruptcy law to the contrary.

 __Amendments__
