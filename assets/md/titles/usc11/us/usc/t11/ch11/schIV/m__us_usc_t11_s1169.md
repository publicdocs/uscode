## § 1169. Effect of rejection of lease of railroad line

    (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a lease of a line of railroad under which the debtor is the lessee is rejected under [section 365 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s365], and if the trustee, within such time as the court fixes, and with the court’s approval, elects not to operate the leased line, the lessor under such lease, after such approval, shall operate the line.

    (b) If operation of such line by such lessor is impracticable or contrary to the public interest, the court, on request of such lessor, and after notice and a hearing, shall order the trustee to continue operation of such line for the account of such lessor until abandonment is ordered under [section 1170 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s1170], or until such operation is otherwise lawfully terminated, whichever occurs first.

    (c) During any such operation, such lessor is deemed a carrier subject to the provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 that are applicable to railroads.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2643][/us/stat/92/2643]; [Pub. L. 97–449][/us/pl/97/449], § 5(a)(3), Jan. 12, 1983, [96 Stat. 2442][/us/stat/96/2442]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III][/us/pl/98/353/tIII], § 520, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 388][/us/stat/98/388].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 1169 of the Senate amendment is deleted from the House amendment as unnecessary since [28 U.S.C. 1407][/us/usc/t28/s1407] treating with the judicial panel on multi-district litigation will apply by its terms to cases under title 11.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Section 1177 \[enacted as section 1169\] continues, essentially without change, the provisions relating to the rejection by the trustee of a lease of a line of railroad now contained in section 77(c)(6) \[section 205(c)(6) of former title 11\]. Subsection (a) requires the lessor of a line of railroad to operate it if the lease is rejected by the trustee and the trustee, with the approval of the court, elects not to operate the leased line. Subsection (b), however, further provides that if operation by the lessor is impractical or contrary to the public interest, the court shall require the trustee to operate the line for the account of the lessor until the operation is lawfully terminated. Subsection (c) provides that during such operation, the lessor is a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act \[[49 U.S.C. 10101][/us/usc/t49/s10101] et seq.\].

 __house report no. 95–595__ 

    \[Section 1168\] This section \[enacted as section 1169\] governs the effect of the rejection by the trustee of an unexpired lease of railroad line under which the debtor is the lessee. If the trustee rejects such a lease, and if the trustee, within such time as the court allows, and with the approval of the court, elects not to operate the leased line, then the lessor under the lease must operate the line.

    Subsection (b) excuses the lessor from the requirement to operate the line under certain circumstances. If operation of the line by the lessor is impracticable or contrary to the public interest, the court, on request of the lessor, must order the trustee to continue operation of the line for the account of the lessor until abandonment is ordered under section 1169, governing abandonments generally, or until the operation is otherwise lawfully terminated, such as by an order of the ICC.

    Subsection (c) deems the lessor a carrier subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act \[[49 U.S.C. 10101][/us/usc/t49/s10101] et seq.\] during the operation of the line before abandonment.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] directed substitution of “subtitle IV of title 49” for “the Interstate Commerce Act ([49 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t49/s1] et seq.)”, which substitution had previously been made by [Pub. L. 97–449][/us/pl/97/449].

    1983—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 97–449][/us/pl/97/449] substituted “sub­title IV of title 49” for “the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.)”.
