## § 1304. Debtor engaged in business

    (a) A debtor that is self-employed and incurs trade credit in the production of income from such employment is engaged in business.

    (b) Unless the court orders otherwise, a debtor engaged in business may operate the business of the debtor and, subject to any limitations on a trustee under sections 363(c) and 364 of this title and to such limitations or conditions as the court prescribes, shall have, exclusive of the trustee, the rights and powers of the trustee under such sections.

    (c) A debtor engaged in business shall perform the duties of the trustee specified in [section 704(a)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t11/s704/a/8].

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2646][/us/stat/92/2646]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III][/us/pl/98/353/tIII], §§ 311(b)(2), 526, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 355][/us/stat/98/355], 389; [Pub. L. 111–327][/us/pl/111/327], § 2(a)(40), Dec. 22, 2010, [124 Stat. 3562][/us/stat/124/3562].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 1304(b) of the House amendment adopts the approach taken in the comparable section of the Senate amendment as preferable to the position taken in the House bill.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Increased access to the simpler, speedier, and less expensive debtor relief provisions of chapter 13 is accomplished by permitting debtors engaged in business to proceed under chapter 13, provided their income is sufficiently stable and regular to permit compliance with a chapter 13 plan \[section 101(24)\] and that the debtor (or the debtor and spouse) do not owe liquidated, noncontingent unsecured debts of $50,000, or liquidated, noncontingent secured debts of $200,000 (§ 109(d)).

    Section 1304(a) states that a self-employed individual who incurs trade credit in the production of income is a debtor engaged in business.

    Subsection (b) empowers a chapter 13 debtor engaged in business to operate his business, subject to the rights, powers and limitations that pertain to a trustee under sections 363(c) and 364 of title 11, and subject to such further limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe.

    Subsection (c) requires a chapter 13 debtor engaged in business to file with the court certain financial statements relating to the operation of the business.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 111–327][/us/pl/111/327] substituted “704(a)(8)” for “704(8)”.

    1984—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 526, struck out the comma after “of the debtor”.

    Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353], § 311(b)(2), substituted “section 704(8)” for “section 704(7)”.

 __Effective Date of 1984 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] effective with respect to cases filed 90 days after July 10, 1984, see [section 552(a) of Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353/s552/a], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s101].
