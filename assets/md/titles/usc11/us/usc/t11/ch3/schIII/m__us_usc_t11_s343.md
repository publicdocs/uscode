    The debtor shall appear and submit to examination under oath at the meeting of creditors under [section 341(a) of this title][/us/usc/t11/s341/a].

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2565][/us/stat/92/2565]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title III, § 436][/us/pl/98/353/s436], July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 370][/us/stat/98/370]; [Pub. L. 99–554, title II, § 213][/us/pl/99/554/s213], Oct. 27, 1986, [100 Stat. 3099][/us/stat/100/3099].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section, derived from section 21a of the Bankruptcy Act \[section 44(a) of former title 11\], requires the debtor to appear at the meeting of creditors and submit to examination under oath. The purpose of the examination is to enable creditors and the trustee to determine if assets have improperly been disposed of or concealed or if there are grounds for objection to discharge. The scope of the examination under this section will be governed by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, as it is today. See rules 205(d), 10–213(c), and 11–26. It is expected that the scope prescribed by these rules for liquidation cases, that is, “only the debtor’s acts, conduct, or property, or any matter that may affect the administration of the estate, or the debtor’s right to discharge” will remain substantially unchanged. In reorganization cases, the examination would be broader, including inquiry into the liabilities and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of his business, and the desirability of the continuance thereof, and other matters relevant to the case and to the formulation of the plan. Examination of other persons in connection with the bankruptcy case is left completely to the rules, just as examination of witnesses in civil cases is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–554][/us/pl/99/554] amended section generally.
