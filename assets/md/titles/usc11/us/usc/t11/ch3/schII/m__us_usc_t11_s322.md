 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 322(a) is modified to include a trustee serving in a railroad reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    A trustee qualifies in a case by filing, within five days after selection, a bond in favor of the United States, conditioned on the faithful performance of his official duties. This section is derived from the Bankruptcy Act section 50b \[section 78(b) of former title 11\]. The court is required to determine the amount of the bond and the sufficiency of the surety on the bond. Subsection (c), derived from Bankruptcy Act section 50i \[section 78(i) of former title 11\], relieves the trustee from personal liability and from liability on his bond for any penalty or forfeiture incurred by the debtor. Subsection (d), derived from section 50m \[section 78(m) of former title 11\], fixes a two-year statute of limitations on any action on a trustee’s bond. Finally, subsection (e) dispenses with the bonding requirement for the United States trustee.
