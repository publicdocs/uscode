## § 344. Self-incrimination; immunity

    Immunity for persons required to submit to examination, to testify, or to provide information in a case under this title may be granted under part V of title 18.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2565][/us/stat/92/2565].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Part V \[§ 6001 et seq.\] of title 18 of the United States Code governs the granting of immunity to witnesses before Federal tribunals. The immunity provided under part V is only use immunity, not transactional immunity. Part V applies to all proceedings before Federal courts, before Federal grand juries, before administrative agencies, and before Congressional committees. It requires the Attorney General or the U. S. attorney to request or to approve any grant of immunity, whether before a court, grand jury, agency, or congressional committee.

    This section carries part V over into bankruptcy cases. Thus, for a witness to be ordered to testify before a bankruptcy court in spite of a claim of privilege, the U. S. attorney for the district in which the court sits would have to request from the district court for that district the immunity order. The rule would apply to both debtors, creditors, and any other witnesses in a bankruptcy case. If the immunity were granted, the witness would be required to testify. If not, he could claim the privilege against self-incrimination.

    Part V is a significant departure from current law. Under section 7a(10) of the Bankruptcy Act \[section 25(a)(10) of former title 11\], a debtor is required to testify in all circumstances, but any testimony he gives may not be used against him in any criminal proceeding, except testimony given in any hearing on objections to discharge. With that exception, section 7a(10) amounts to a blanket grant of use immunity to all debtors. Immunity for other witnesses in bankruptcy courts today is governed by part V of title 18.

    The consequences of a claim of privileges by a debtor under proposed law and under current law differ as well. Under section 14c(6) of current law \[section 32(c)(6) of former title 11\], any refusal to answer a material question approved by the court will result in the denial of a discharge, even if the refusal is based on the privilege against self incrimination. Thus, the debtor is confronted with the choice between losing his discharge and opening himself up to possible criminal prosecution.

    Under section 727(a)(6) of the proposed title 11, a debtor is only denied a discharge if he refuses to testify after having been granted immunity. If the debtor claims the privilege and the U. S. attorney does not request immunity from the district courts, then the debtor may refuse to testify and still retain his right to a discharge. It removes the Scylla and Charibdis choice for debtors that exists under the Bankruptcy Act \[former title 11\].
