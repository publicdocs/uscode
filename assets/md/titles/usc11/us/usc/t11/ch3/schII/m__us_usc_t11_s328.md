## § 328. Limitation on compensation of professional persons

    (a) The trustee, or a committee appointed under [section 1102 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s1102], with the court’s approval, may employ or authorize the employment of a professional person under section 327 or 1103 of this title, as the case may be, on any reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including on a retainer, on an hourly basis, on a fixed or percentage fee basis, or on a contingent fee basis. Notwithstanding such terms and conditions, the court may allow compensation different from the compensation provided under such terms and conditions after the conclusion of such employment, if such terms and conditions prove to have been improvident in light of developments not capable of being anticipated at the time of the fixing of such terms and conditions.

    (b) If the court has authorized a trustee to serve as an attorney or accountant for the estate under [section 327(d) of this title][/us/usc/t11/s327/d], the court may allow compensation for the trustee’s services as such attorney or accountant only to the extent that the trustee performed services as attorney or accountant for the estate and not for performance of any of the trustee’s duties that are generally performed by a trustee without the assistance of an attorney or accountant for the estate.

    (c) Except as provided in section 327(c), 327(e), or 1107(b) of this title, the court may deny allowance of compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103 of this title if, at any time during such professional person’s employment under section 327 or 1103 of this title, such professional person is not a disinterested person, or represents or holds an interest adverse to the interest of the estate with respect to the matter on which such professional person is employed.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 328(c) adopts a technical amendment contained in the Senate amendment indicating that an attorney for the debtor in possession is not disqualified for compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses simply because of prior representation of the debtor.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section, which is parallel to section 326, fixes the maximum compensation allowable to a professional person employed under section 327. It authorizes the trustee, with the court’s approval, to employ professional persons on any reasonable terms, including on a retainer, on an hourly or on a contingent fee basis. Subsection (a) further permits the court to allow compensation different from the compensation provided under the trustee’s agreement if the prior agreement proves to have been improvident in light of development unanticipatable at the time of the agreement. The court’s power includes the power to increase as well as decrease the agreed upon compensation. This provision is permissive, not mandatory, and should not be used by the court if to do so would violate the code of ethics of the professional involved.

    Subsection (b) limits a trustee that has been authorized to serve as his own counsel to only one fee for each service. The purpose of permitting the trustee to serve as his own counsel is to reduce costs. It is not included to provide the trustee with a bonus by permitting him to receive two fees for the same service or to avoid the maxima fixed in section 326. Thus, this subsection requires the court to differentiate between the trustee’s services as trustee, and his services as trustee’s counsel, and to fix compensation accordingly. Services that a trustee normally performs for an estate without assistance of counsel are to be compensated under the limits fixed in section 326. Only services that he performs that are normally performed by trustee’s counsel may be compensated under the maxima imposed by this section.

    Subsection (c) permits the court to deny compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person is not disinterested or if he represents or holds an interest adverse to the estate on the matter on which he is employed. The subsection provides a penalty for conflicts of interest.

 __Amendments__ 

    2005—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 109–8][/us/pl/109/8] inserted “on a fixed or percentage fee basis,” after “hourly basis,”.

    1984—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] substituted “not capable of being anticipated” for “unanticipatable”.

 __Effective Date of 2005 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 109–8][/us/pl/109/8] effective 180 days after Apr. 20, 2005, and not applicable with respect to cases commenced under this title before such effective date, except as otherwise provided, see [section 1501 of Pub. L. 109–8][/us/pl/109/8/s1501], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s101].

 __Effective Date of 1984 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] effective with respect to cases filed 90 days after July 10, 1984, see [section 552(a) of Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353/s552/a], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s101].
