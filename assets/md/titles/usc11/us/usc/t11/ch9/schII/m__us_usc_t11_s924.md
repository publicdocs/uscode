## § 924. List of creditors

    The debtor shall file a list of creditors.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2623][/us/stat/92/2623].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 924 of the House amendment is derived from section 924 of the House bill with the location of the filing of the list of creditors to be determined by the rules of bankruptcy procedure. The detailed requirements of section 724 \[probably should be “924”\] of the Senate bill are anticipated to be incorporated in the rules of bankruptcy procedure.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section adopts the provision presently contained in section 85(b) of Chapter IX \[section 405(b) of former title 11\]. A list of creditors, as complete and accurate as practicable, must be filed with the court.

 __house report no. 95–595__ 

    This section directs the debtor to file a list of creditors with the court. A comparable provision is presently contained in section 85(b) of chapter IX \[section 405(b) of former title 11\]. The Rules, in Rule 9–7, copy the provisions of section 85(b), with additional matter. As noted above, section 405(d) of title IV will continue those Rules in effect. Because the form, time of filing, and nature of the list, are procedural matters that may call for some flexibility, those details have been left to the Rules.
