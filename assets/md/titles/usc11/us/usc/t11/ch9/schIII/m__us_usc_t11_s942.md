## § 942. Modification of plan

    The debtor may modify the plan at any time before confirmation, but may not modify the plan so that the plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of this chapter. After the debtor files a modification, the plan as modified becomes the plan.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2624][/us/stat/92/2624].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    The House amendment deletes section 942 of the Senate amendment in favor of incorporating section 1125 by cross-reference. Similarly, the House amendment does not incorporate section 944 or 945 of the Senate amendment since incorporation of several sections in chapter 11 in section 901 is sufficient.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Section 942 permits the debtor to modify the plan at any time before confirmation, as does section 90(a) of current law \[section 410(a) of former title 11\].
