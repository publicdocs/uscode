## § 904. Limitation on jurisdiction and powers of court

Notwithstanding any power of the court, unless the debtor consents or the plan so provides, the court may not, by any stay, order, or decree, in the case or otherwise, interfere with—

    (1) any of the political or governmental powers of the debtor;

    (2) any of the property or revenues of the debtor; or

    (3) the debtor’s use or enjoyment of any income-producing property.

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2622][/us/stat/92/2622].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section adopts the policy of section 82(c) of current law \[section 402(c) of former title 11\]. The only change in this section from section 82(c) is to conform the section to the style and cross-references of S. 2266.

 __house report no. 95–595__ 

    This section adopts the policy of section 82(c) of current law \[section 402(c) of former title 11\]. The Usery case underlines the need for this limitation on the court’s powers. The only change in this section from section 82(c) is to conform the section to the style and cross-references of H.R. 8200. This section makes clear that the court may not interfere with the choices a municipality makes as to what services and benefits it will provide to its inhabitants.
