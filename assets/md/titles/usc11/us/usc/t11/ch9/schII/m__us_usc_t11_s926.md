## § 926. Avoiding powers

    (a) If the debtor refuses to pursue a cause of action under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549(a), or 550 of this title, then on request of a creditor, the court may appoint a trustee to pursue such cause of action.

    (b) A transfer of property of the debtor to or for the benefit of any holder of a bond or note, on account of such bond or note, may not be avoided under [section 547 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s547].

([Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598], Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2623][/us/stat/92/2623]; [Pub. L. 100–597, § 6][/us/pl/100/597/s6], Nov. 3, 1988, [102 Stat. 3029][/us/stat/102/3029].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 926 of the House amendment is derived from section 928 of the Senate bill. The provision enables creditors to request the court to appoint a trustee to pursue avoiding powers if the debtor refuses to exercise those powers. Section 901 of the House amendment makes a corresponding change to incorporate avoiding powers included in the Senate amendment, but excluded from the House bill.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    This section \[928 (enacted as section 926)\] adopts current section 85(h) \[section 405(h) of former title 11\] which provides for a trustee to be appointed for the purpose of pursuing an action under an avoiding power, if the debtor refuses to do so. This section is necessary because a municipality might, by reason of political pressure or desire for future good relations with a particular creditor or class of creditors, make payments to such creditors in the days preceding the petition to the detriment of all other creditors. No change in the elected officials of such a city would automatically occur upon filing of the petition, and it might be very awkward for those same officials to turn around and demand the return of the payments following the filing of the petition. Hence, the need for a trustee for such purpose.

    The general avoiding powers are incorporated by reference in section 901 and are broader than under current law. Preference, fraudulent conveyances, and other kinds of transfers will thus be voidable.

    Incorporated by reference also is the power to accept or reject executory contracts and leases (section 365). Within the definition of executory contracts are collective bargaining agreements between the city and its employees. Such contracts may be rejected despite contrary State laws. Courts should readily allow the rejection of such contracts where they are burdensome, the rejection will aid in the municipality’s reorganization and in consideration of the equities of each case. On the last point, “\[e\]quities in favor of the city in chapter 9 will be far more compelling than the equities in favor of the employer in chapter 11. Onerous employment obligations may prevent a city from balancing its budget for some time. The prospect of an unbalanced budget may preclude judicial confirmation of the plan. Unless a city can reject its labor contracts, lack of funds may force cutbacks in police, fire, sanitation, and welfare services, imposing hardships on many citizens. In addition, because cities in the past have often seemed immune to the constraint of “profitability” faced by private businesses, their wage contracts may be relatively more onerous than those in the private sector.” Executory Contracts and Municipal Bankruptcy, 85 Yale L. J. 957, 965 (1976) (footnote omitted). Rejection of the contracts may require the municipalities to renegotiate such contracts by state collective bargaining laws. It is intended that the power to reject collective bargaining agreements will pre-empt state termination provisions, but not state collective bargaining laws. Thus, a city would not be required to maintain existing employment terms during the renegotiation period.

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–597][/us/pl/100/597] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b).

 __Effective Date of 1988 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 100–597][/us/pl/100/597] effective Nov. 3, 1988, but not applicable to any case commenced under this title before that date, see [section 12 of Pub. L. 100–597][/us/pl/100/597/s12], set out as a note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s101].
