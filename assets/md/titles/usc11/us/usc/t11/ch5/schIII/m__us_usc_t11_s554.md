    (a) After notice and a hearing, the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.

    (c) Unless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under [section 521(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t11/s521/a/1] not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of [section 350 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s350].

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __legislative statements__ 

    Section 554(b) is new and permits a party in interest to request the court to order the trustee to abandon property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value to the estate.

 __senate report no. 95–989__ 

    Under this section the court may authorize the trustee to abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value to the estate. Abandonment may be to any party with a possessory interest in the property abandoned. In order to aid administration of the case, subsection (b) deems the court to have authorized abandonment of any property that is scheduled under section 521(1) and that is not administered before the case is closed. That property is deemed abandoned to the debtor. Subsection (c) specifies that if property is neither abandoned nor administered it remains property of the estate.

(c) read as follows: “Unless the court orders otherwise, any property that is scheduled under [section 521(1) of this title][/us/usc/t11/s521/1] and that is not administered before a case is closed under [section 350 of this title][/us/usc/t11/s350] is deemed abandoned.”

    Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 98–353, § 468(c)][/us/pl/98/353/s468/c], struck out “section (a) or (b) of” after “not abandoned under”.
