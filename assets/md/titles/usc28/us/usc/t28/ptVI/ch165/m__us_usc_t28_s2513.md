 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on sections 729–732 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure ([May 24, 1938, ch. 266][/us/act/1938-05-24/ch266], §§ 1–4, [52 Stat. 438][/us/stat/52/438].)

    Sections 729–732 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated and completely rewritten in order to clarify ambiguities which made the statute unworkable as enacted originally. Jurisdictional provisions of [section 729 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s729], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in [section 1495 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1495].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

    1992—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 102–572][/us/pl/102/572] substituted “United States Court of Federal Claims” for “United States Claims Court”.
