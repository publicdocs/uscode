 __Codification__ 

    Section was derived from R.S. § 925, which was originally classified to section 738 of former Title 28. Following the general revision and enactment of Title 28 by act June 25, 1948, R.S. § 925 was reclassified to [section 838 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s838]. R.S. § 925 was repealed by [section 12(c) of Pub. L. 86–682][/us/pl/86/682/s12/c] (section 1 of which revised and enacted Title 39), and reenacted by section 9 thereof as [section 2711 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2711].
