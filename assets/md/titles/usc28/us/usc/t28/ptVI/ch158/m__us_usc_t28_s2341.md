    Subsection (a) of former [section 1031 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s1031] is omitted as unnecessary because the term “court of appeals” as used in title 28 means a United States Court of Appeals and no additional definition is necessary.

    In paragraph (3), reference to the United States Maritime Commission is omitted because that Commission was abolished by 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 21, § 306, eff.
