([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 984][/us/stat/62/984]; [July 16, 1949, ch. 340][/us/act/1949-07-16/ch340], [63 Stat. 444][/us/stat/63/444]; [Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049][/us/act/1950-09-26/ch1049], §§ 2(a)(2), 13(5), [64 Stat. 1038][/us/stat/64/1038], 1043; [Pub. L. 86–168, title II, § 202(b)][/us/pl/86/168/s202/b], Aug. 18, 1959, [73 Stat. 389][/us/stat/73/389]; [Pub. L. 93–253, § 2][/us/pl/93/253/s2], Mar. 16, 1974, [88 Stat. 50][/us/stat/88/50]; [Pub. L. 106–185, § 3(a)][/us/pl/106/185/s3/a], Apr. 25, 2000, [114 Stat. 211][/us/stat/114/211]; [Pub. L. 109–304, § 17(f)(4)][/us/pl/109/304/s17/f/4], Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1708][/us/stat/120/1708].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 943 ([Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753, § 421][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753/s421], [60 Stat. 845][/us/stat/60/845]).

    Changes were made in phraseology.

    [Section 946 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s946], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from section 424(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, was omitted from this revised title. It preserved the existing authority of federal agencies to settle tort claims not cognizable under [section 2672 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2672]. Certain enumerated laws granting such authority were specifically repealed by section 424(a) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, which section was also omitted from this revised title. These provisions were not included in this revised title as they are not properly a part of a code of general and permanent law.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    Sections 2680 and 2681 were renumbered “2679” and “2680”, respectively, by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
