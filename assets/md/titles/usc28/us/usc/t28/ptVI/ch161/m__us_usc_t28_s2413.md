## § 2413. Executions in favor of United States

    A writ of execution on a judgment obtained for the use of the United States in any court thereof shall be issued from and made returnable to the court which rendered the judgment, but may be executed in any other State, in any Territory, or in the District of Columbia.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 974][/us/stat/62/974].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 839 (R.S. § 986).

    Words “or in the District of Columbia” were added on the authority of 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 384, declaring that, under this section, a writ of execution in favor of the United States, obtained from a Federal court in any State, could be executed in the District of Columbia. (See, also, [section 1963 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1963].)

    Changes in phraseology were made.
