    The section is reorganized for clarity and conciseness. The word “is” is substituted for “shall be”. The word “petitioner” is substituted for “party or any of the parties filing the petition for review” in view of the definition of “petitioner” in [section 2341 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2341].
