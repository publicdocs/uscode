The State shall, subject to the applicable provisions of law, have all the rights of a party and be subject to all liabilities of a party as to court costs to the extent necessary for a proper presentation of the facts and law relating to the question of constitutionality.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 401 ([Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, § 1][/us/act/1937-08-24/ch754/s1], [50 Stat. 751][/us/stat/50/751]).

    Word “action” was added before “suit or proceeding”, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–381, § 5(b)][/us/pl/94/381/s5/b], inserted “or a State” after “United States” in section catchline.

    Subsecs. (a), (b). [Pub. L. 94–381, § 5(a)][/us/pl/94/381/s5/a], designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b).
