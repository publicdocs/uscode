 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 45a ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 212, 213, [36 Stat. 1150][/us/stat/36/1150], 1151; [Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32][/us/act/1913-10-22/ch32], [38 Stat. 220][/us/stat/38/220]).

    The provision in the second sentence of [section 45a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s45a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Attorney General to employ and compensate special attorneys was omitted as covered by sections 503 and 508 \[now 543 and 548\] of this title. The provision in the same sentence authorizing the court to make rules for the conduct and procedure of actions under this section were omitted as covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and [section 2071 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2071] relating to authority of district courts to promulgate local rules of procedure.

    The last paragraph of [section 45a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s45a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as merely repetitive of the language immediately following the first proviso.

    Word “action” was substituted for “suit” in conformity with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
