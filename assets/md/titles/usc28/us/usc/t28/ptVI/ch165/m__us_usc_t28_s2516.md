 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 284 and [section 226 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s226], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance ([Sept. 30, 1890, ch. 1126, § 1][/us/act/1890-09-30/ch1126/s1], [26 Stat. 537][/us/stat/26/537]; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 177][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s177], [36 Stat. 1141][/us/stat/36/1141]; [Nov. 23, 1921, ch. 136, § 1324(b)][/us/act/1921-11-23/ch136/s1324/b], [42 Stat. 316][/us/stat/42/316]; [June 2, 1924, ch. 234, § 1020][/us/act/1924-06-02/ch234/s1020], [43 Stat. 346][/us/stat/43/346]; [Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, § 3(c)][/us/act/1925-02-13/ch229/s3/c], [43 Stat. 939][/us/stat/43/939]; [Feb. 26, 1926, ch. 27][/us/act/1926-02-26/ch27], §§ 1117, 1200, [44 Stat. 119][/us/stat/44/119], 125; [May 29, 1928, ch. 852, § 615(a)][/us/act/1928-05-29/ch852/s615/a], [45 Stat. 877][/us/stat/45/877]; [June 22, 1936, ch. 690, § 808][/us/act/1936-06-22/ch690/s808], [49 Stat. 1746][/us/stat/49/1746]).

    Subdivision (b) of [section 284 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s284], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as covered by [section 3771 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3771], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code. Such omission required the exception in subdivision (a) of such section 284, reading: “except as provided in subdivision (b)”, to be changed to read: “or Act of Congress expressly providing for payment thereof.”

    Subsection (b) of this section is based on the last sentence of [section 226 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s226], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
