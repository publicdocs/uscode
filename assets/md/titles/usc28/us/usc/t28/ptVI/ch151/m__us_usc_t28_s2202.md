## § 2202. Further relief

    Further necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted, after reasonable notice and hearing, against any adverse party whose rights have been determined by such judgment.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 964][/us/stat/62/964].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 400 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 274d, as added [June 14, 1934, ch. 512][/us/act/1934-06-14/ch512], [48 Stat. 955][/us/stat/48/955]; [Aug. 30, 1935, ch. 829][/us/act/1935-08-30/ch829], § 405, [49 Stat. 1027][/us/stat/49/1027]).

    This section is based on the second paragraph of [section 400 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s400], U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of such section are incorporated in [section 2201 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2201].

    Provision in said section 400 that the court shall require adverse parties whose rights are adjudicated to show cause why further relief should not be granted forthwith, were omitted as unnecessary and covered by the revised section.

    Provisions relating to submission of interrogatories to a jury were omitted as covered by rule 49 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
