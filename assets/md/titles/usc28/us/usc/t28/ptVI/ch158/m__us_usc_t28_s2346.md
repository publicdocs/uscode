    The words “of the court of appeals in which the proceeding is pending” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “clerk” in [section 2341 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2341], and by reason of the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals set forth in [section 2342 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2342].
