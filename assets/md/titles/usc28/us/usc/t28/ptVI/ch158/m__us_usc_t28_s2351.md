    The words “United States” preceding “district court” are omitted as unnecessary because the term “district court” as used in title 28 means a United States district court. See [section 451 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s451], United States Code. The words “have jurisdiction” are substituted for “are vested with jurisdiction”. The words “heretofore or hereafter” following “order” are omitted as unnecessary and any existing rights and liabilities are preserved by technical sections 7 and 8.
