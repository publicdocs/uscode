## § 2674. Liability of United States

    The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.

    If, however, in any case wherein death was caused, the law of the place where the act or omission complained of occurred provides, or has been construed to provide, for damages only punitive in nature, the United States shall be liable for actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death to the persons respectively, for whose benefit the action was brought, in lieu thereof.

    With respect to any claim under this chapter, the United States shall be entitled to assert any defense based upon judicial or legislative immunity which otherwise would have been available to the employee of the United States whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, as well as any other defenses to which the United States is entitled.

    With respect to any claim to which this section applies, the Tennessee Valley Authority shall be entitled to assert any defense which otherwise would have been available to the employee based upon judicial or legislative immunity, which otherwise would have been available to the employee of the Tennessee Valley Authority whose act or omission gave rise to the claim as well as any other defenses to which the Tennessee Valley Authority is entitled under this chapter.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 983][/us/stat/62/983]; [Pub. L. 100–694][/us/pl/100/694], §§ 4, 9(c), Nov. 18, 1988, [102 Stat. 4564][/us/stat/102/4564], 4567.)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 931(a) ([Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753], § 410(a), [60 Stat. 843][/us/stat/60/843]).

    Section constitutes the liability provisions in the second sentence of [section 931(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s931/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Other provisions of [section 931(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s931/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1346(b), 1402, 2402, 2411, and 2412 of this title, but the provision of such section 931(a) that the United States shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment was omitted as unnecessary in view of [section 2411 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2411], which provides that interest on judgments against the United States shall be computed from the date of judgment. Such section 2411 is made applicable to tort-claim actions by [section 932 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s932], U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__
