## § 1345. United States as plaintiff

    Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States, or by any agency or officer thereof expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 933][/us/stat/62/933].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 41(1) ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 24, par. 1, [36 Stat. 1091][/us/stat/36/1091]; [May 14, 1934, ch. 283][/us/act/1934-05-14/ch283], § 1, [48 Stat. 775][/us/stat/48/775]; [Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726][/us/act/1937-08-21/ch726], § 1, [50 Stat. 738][/us/stat/50/738]; [Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117][/us/act/1940-04-20/ch117], [54 Stat. 143][/us/stat/54/143]).

    Other provisions of [section 41(1) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/1], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1332, 1341, 1342, 1354, and 1359 of this title.

    Words “civil actions, suits or proceedings” were substituted for “suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity” in view of Rules 2 and 81(a)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Word “agency” was inserted in order that this section shall apply to actions by agencies of the Government and to conform with special acts authorizing such actions. (See definitive [section 451 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s451].)

    The phrase “Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress,” at the beginning of the section was inserted to make clear that jurisdiction exists generally in district courts in the absence of special provisions conferring it elsewhere.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
