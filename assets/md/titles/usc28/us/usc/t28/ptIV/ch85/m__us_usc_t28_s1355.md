## § 1355. Fine, penalty or forfeiture

    (a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of any action or proceeding for the recovery or enforcement of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, incurred under any Act of Congress, except matters within the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade under [section 1582 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1582].

    (b)

        (1)

         A forfeiture action or proceeding may be brought in—

            (A) the district court for the district in which any of the acts or omissions giving rise to the forfeiture occurred, or

            (B) any other district where venue for the forfeiture action or proceeding is specifically provided for in [section 1395 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1395] or any other statute.

        (2) Whenever property subject to forfeiture under the laws of the United States is located in a foreign country, or has been detained or seized pursuant to legal process or competent authority of a foreign government, an action or proceeding for forfeiture may be brought as provided in paragraph (1), or in the United States District court  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be capitalized. </sup></sup>  for the District of Columbia.

    (c) In any case in which a final order disposing of property in a civil forfeiture action or proceeding is appealed, removal of the property by the prevailing party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction. Upon motion of the appealing party, the district court or the court of appeals shall issue any order necessary to preserve the right of the appealing party to the full value of the property at issue, including a stay of the judgment of the district court pending appeal or requiring the prevailing party to post an appeal bond.

    (d) Any court with jurisdiction over a forfeiture action pursuant to subsection (b) may issue and cause to be served in any other district such process as may be required to bring before the court the property that is the subject of the forfeiture action.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 934][/us/stat/62/934]; [Pub. L. 96–417, title V, § 507][/us/pl/96/417/s507], Oct. 10, 1980, [94 Stat. 1743][/us/stat/94/1743]; [Pub. L. 102–550, title XV, § 1521][/us/pl/102/550/s1521], Oct. 28, 1992, [106 Stat. 4062][/us/stat/106/4062].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 41(9) and 371(2) ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 24, par. 9, 256, par. 2, [36 Stat. 1092][/us/stat/36/1092], 1160).

    Word “fine” was inserted so that this section will apply to the many provisions in the United States Code for fines which are essentially civil. (See, also, [section 2461 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2461] and reviser’s note thereunder.)

    Words “pecuniary or otherwise” were added to make this section expressly applicable to both pecuniary and property forfeitures. The original section was so construed in Miller v. United States, 1870, 11 Wall. 268, 20 L.Ed. 135; Tyler v. Defrees, 1870, 11 Wall. 331, and The Rosemary, C.C.A. 1928, 26 F.2d 354, certiorari denied 49 S.Ct. 23, 278 U.S. 619, 73 L.Ed. 542.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–550][/us/pl/102/550] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsecs. (b) to (d).

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–417][/us/pl/96/417] inserted exception for matters within the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade under [section 1582 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1582].

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–417][/us/pl/96/417] applicable with respect to civil actions commenced on or after the 90th day after Nov. 1, 1980, see [section 701(c)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 96–417][/us/pl/96/417/s701/c/1/B], set out as a note under [section 251 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s251].
