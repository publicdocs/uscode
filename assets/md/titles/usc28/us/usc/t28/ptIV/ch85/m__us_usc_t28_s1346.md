        (2) Any other civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort, except that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against the United States founded upon any express or implied contract with the United States or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort which are subject to sections 7104(b)(1) and 7107(a)(1) of title 41.

        (2) No person convicted of a felony who is incarcerated while awaiting sentencing or while serving a sentence may bring a civil action against the United States or an agency, officer, or employee of the Government, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury or the commission of a sexual act (as defined in [section 2246 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s2246]).

    (d) The district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of any civil action or claim for a pension.

    (e) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action against the United States provided in section 6226, 6228(a), 7426, or 7428 (in the case of the United States district court for the District of Columbia) or section 7429 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 41(20), 931(a), 932 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 24][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s24], par. 20, [36 Stat. 1093][/us/stat/36/1093]; [Nov. 23, 1921, ch. 136, § 1310(c)][/us/act/1921-11-23/ch136/s1310/c], [42 Stat. 311][/us/stat/42/311]; [June 2, 1924, ch. 234, § 1025(c)][/us/act/1924-06-02/ch234/s1025/c], [43 Stat. 348][/us/stat/43/348]; [Feb. 24, 1925, ch. 309][/us/act/1925-02-24/ch309], [43 Stat. 972][/us/stat/43/972]; [Feb. 26, 1926, ch. 27][/us/act/1926-02-26/ch27], §§ 1122(c), 1200, [44 Stat. 121][/us/stat/44/121], 125; [Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753], §§ 410(a), 411, [60 Stat. 843][/us/stat/60/843]).

    Section consolidates provisions of section 41(20) conferring jurisdiction upon the district court, in civil actions against the United States, with the first sentence of section 931(a) relating to jurisdiction of the district courts in tort claims cases, and those provisions of section 932 making the provisions of said section 41(20), relating to counterclaim and set-off, applicable to tort claims cases, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Provision in [section 931(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s931/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., for trials without a jury, is incorporated in section 2402 of this revised title. For other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

    Words “commencing an action under this section” in subsec. (c) of this revised section cover the provision in [section 932 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s932], U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that the same provisions “for counterclaim and set-off” shall apply to tort claims cases brought in the district courts.

    The phrase in [section 931(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s931/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., “accruing on and after January 1, 1945” was omitted because executed as of the date of the enactment of this revised title.

    Provisions in [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to time for commencing action against United States and jury trial constitute sections 2401 and 2402 of this title. (See reviser’s notes under said sections.)

    Words in [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., “commenced after passage of the Revenue Act of 1921” were not included in revised subsection (a)(1) because obsolete and superfluous. Actions under this section involving erroneous or illegal assessments by the collector of taxes would be barred unless filed within the 5-year limitation period of section 1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, [44 Stat. 9][/us/stat/44/9], 116. (See United States v. A. S. Kreider Co., 1941, 61 S.Ct. 1007, 313 U.S. 443, 85 L.Ed. 1447.)

    Words in [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., “if the collector of internal revenue is dead or is not in office at the time such action or proceeding is commenced” were omitted.

    The revised section retains the language of [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to actions against the United States if the collector is dead or not in office when action is commenced, and consequently maintains the long existing distinctions in practice between actions against the United States and actions against the collector who made the assessment or collection. In the latter class of actions either party may demand a jury trial while jury trial is denied in actions against the United States. See [section 2402 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2402]. In reality all such actions are against the United States and not against local collectors. (See Lowe v. United States, 1938, 58 S.Ct. 896, 304 U.S. 302, 82 L.Ed. 1362; Manseau v. United States, D.C.Mich. 1943, 52 F.Supp. 395, and Combined Metals Reduction Co. v. United States, D.C.Utah 1943, 53 F.Supp. 739.)

    The revised subsection (c)(1) omitted clause: “but no suit pending on the 27th day of June 1898 shall abate or be affected by this provision,” contained in [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., as obsolete and superfluous. The words contained in [section 41(20) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s41/20], U.S.C., 1940 ed., “claims growing out of the Civil War, and commonly known as ‘war-claims,’ or to hear and determine other claims which had been reported adversely prior to the 3d day of March 1887 by any court, department, or commission authorized to have and determine the same,” were omitted for the same reason.

    The words “in a civil action or in admiralty,” in subsection (a)(2), were substituted for “either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty” to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Words in section 41(20) “in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable” were omitted from subsection (a)(2) of this revised section as unnecessary. See reviser’s note under [section 1491 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1491].

    For jurisdiction of The Tax Court to review claims for refunds of processing taxes collected under the unconstitutional Agriculture Adjustment Act, see sections 644–659 of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and the 1942 Revenue Act, [Act Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 610][/us/act/1942-10-21/ch610], title V, § 510(a), (c), (d), [56 Stat. 667][/us/stat/56/667]. (See, also, Lamborn v. United States, C.C.P.A. 1939, 104 F.2d 75, certiorari denied 60 S.Ct. 115, 308 U.S. 589, 84 L.Ed. 493.)

    See, also, reviser’s note under [section 1491 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1491] as to jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in suits against the United States generally. For venue of actions under this section, see [section 1402 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1402] and reviser’s note thereunder.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.
