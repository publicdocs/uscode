## § 1442. Federal officers or agencies sued or prosecuted

    (a)

     A civil action or criminal prosecution that is commenced in a State court and that is against or directed to any of the following may be removed by them to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:

        (1) The United States or any agency thereof or any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, in an official or individual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such office or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.

        (2) A property holder whose title is derived from any such officer, where such action or prosecution affects the validity of any law of the United States.

        (3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, for or relating to any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties;

        (4) Any officer of either House of Congress, for or relating to any act in the discharge of his official duty under an order of such House.

    (b) A personal action commenced in any State court by an alien against any citizen of a State who is, or at the time the alleged action accrued was, a civil officer of the United States and is a nonresident of such State, wherein jurisdiction is obtained by the State court by personal service of process, may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division in which the defendant was served with process.

    (c)

     Solely for purposes of determining the propriety of removal under subsection (a), a law enforcement officer, who is the defendant in a criminal prosecution, shall be deemed to have been acting under the color of his office if the officer—

        (1) protected an individual in the presence of the officer from a crime of violence;

        (2) provided immediate assistance to an individual who suffered, or who was threatened with, bodily harm; or

        (3) prevented the escape of any individual who the officer reasonably believed to have committed, or was about to commit, in the presence of the officer, a crime of violence that resulted in, or was likely to result in, death or serious bodily injury.

    (d)

     In this section, the following definitions apply:

        (1) The terms “civil action” and “criminal prosecution” include any proceeding (whether or not ancillary to another proceeding) to the extent that in such proceeding a judicial order, including a subpoena for testimony or documents, is sought or issued. If removal is sought for a proceeding described in the previous sentence, and there is no other basis for removal, only that proceeding may be removed to the district court.

        (2) The term “crime of violence” has the meaning given that term in [section 16 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s16].

        (3) The term “law enforcement officer” means any employee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of [section 8401(17) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8401/17] and any special agent in the Diplomatic Security Service of the Department of State.

        (6) The term “State court” includes the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, a court of a United States territory or insular possession, and a tribal court.

L. 104–317, title II, § 206(a)][/us/pl/104/317/s206/a], Oct. 19, 1996, [110 Stat. 3850][/us/stat/110/3850]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 76 and 77 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 33, 34, [36 Stat. 1097][/us/stat/36/1097], 1098; [Aug. 23, 1916, ch. 399][/us/act/1916-08-23/ch399], [39 Stat. 532][/us/stat/39/532]).

    Section consolidates sections 76 and 77 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    The revised subsection (a)(1) is extended to apply to all officers and employees of the United States or any agency thereof. [Section 76 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s76], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was limited to revenue officers engaged in the enforcement of the criminal or revenue laws.

    The procedural provisions of [section 76 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s76], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1446 and 1447 of this title. (See reviser’s notes under those sections.)
