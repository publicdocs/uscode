L. 89–719, title II, § 202(b)][/us/pl/89/719/s202/b], Nov. 2, 1966, [80 Stat. 1149][/us/stat/80/1149]; [Pub. L. 92–562, § 2][/us/pl/92/562/s2], Oct. 25, 1972, [86 Stat. 1176][/us/stat/86/1176]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 762, 931(a) ([Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 359, § 5][/us/act/1887-03-03/ch359/s5], [24 Stat. 506][/us/stat/24/506]; [Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753, § 410(a)][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753/s410/a], [60 Stat. 843][/us/stat/60/843]).

    Section consolidates the venue provisions of [section 762 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s762], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with the venue provisions of section 931(a) of such title, the latter provisions relating to tort claims cases. The jurisdictional provisions of such section 931(a) are incorporated in [section 1346(b) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1346/b]. For other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

    Provisions of [section 762 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s762], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the verification and contents of a petition filed against the United States were omitted as unnecessary. [Section 265 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s265], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relative to the petition in cases filed in the Court of Claims was also omitted from the revised title. (See, also, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.)

    Words “civil action” were substituted for “suit” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1982—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 97–164][/us/pl/97/164] inserted “in a district court” after “civil action” in introductory provisions preceding par. (1). The phrase “civil action” also appeared in par. (2), but no change was made to reflect the probable intent of Congress as indicated on page 79 of House Report No. 97–312.

    1972—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 92–562][/us/pl/92/562] added subsec. (d).

    1966—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 89–719][/us/pl/89/719] added subsec. (c).

    1958—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 85–920][/us/pl/85/920] provided for venue and change of venue in tax refund suits by corporation.

 __Effective Date of 1982 Amendment__

 __Effective Date of 1966 Amendment__
