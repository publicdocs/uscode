## § 1406. Cure or waiver of defects

    (a) The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.

    (b) Nothing in this chapter shall impair the jurisdiction of a district court of any matter involving a party who does not interpose timely and sufficient objection to the venue.

    (c) As used in this section, the term “district court” includes the District Court of Guam, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, and the term “district” includes the territorial jurisdiction of each such court.

L. 97–164, title I][/us/pl/97/164/tI], § 132, Apr. 2, 1982, [96 Stat. 39][/us/stat/96/39]; [Pub. L. 104–317, title VI][/us/pl/104/317/tVI], § 610(b), Oct. 19, 1996, [110 Stat. 3860][/us/stat/110/3860].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Subsection (a) provides statutory sanction for transfer instead of dismissal, where venue is improperly laid.

    Subsection (b) is declaratory of existing law. (See Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, 1924, 44 S.Ct. 391, 264 U.S. 375, 68 L.Ed. 748.) It makes clear the intent of Congress that venue provisions are not jurisdictional but may be waived.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section removes an ambiguity in [section 1406(a) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1406/a], U.S.C., by substituting “may” for “shall”, thus making it clear that the court may decline to transfer a case brought in the wrong district under circumstances where it would not be in the interest of justice to make such transfer. \[The amendment to [section 1406(a) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1406/a] described in this note was altered in the bill as enacted. See Cong. Rec., vol. 95, pt. 5, pp. 5826, 5827, 6283, 6284.\]

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 104–317][/us/pl/104/317] amended subsec. (c) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (c) read as follows: “As used in this section, ‘district court’ includes the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone; and ‘district’ includes the territorial jurisdiction of that court.”

    1982—Subsecs. (c), (d). [Pub. L. 97–164][/us/pl/97/164] redesignated subsec. (d) as (c). Former subsec. (c), which provided that if a case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims were filed in a district court, the district court, if it were in the interest of justice, was required to transfer the case to the Court of Claims where the case would proceed as if it had been filed in the Court of Claims on the date that it was filed in the district court, was struck out.

    1962—Subsec. (d). [Pub. L. 87–845][/us/pl/87/845] added subsec. (d).

    1960—Subsec. (c). [Pub. L. 86–770][/us/pl/86/770] added subsec. (c).

    1949—Subsec. (a). Act May 24, 1949, inserted “dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice”.
