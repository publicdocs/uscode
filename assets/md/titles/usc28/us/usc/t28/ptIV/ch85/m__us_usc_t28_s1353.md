## § 1353. Indian allotments

    The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action involving the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any Act of Congress or treaty.

    The judgment in favor of any claimant to an allotment of land shall have the same effect, when properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, as if such allotment had been allowed and approved by him; but this provision shall not apply to any lands held on or before December 21, 1911, by either of the Five Civilized Tribes, the Osage Nation of Indians, nor to any of the lands within the Quapaw Indian Agency.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 934][/us/stat/62/934].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 41(24) ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 24, par. 24, [36 Stat. 1094][/us/stat/36/1094]; [Dec. 21, 1911, ch. 5][/us/act/1911-12-21/ch5], [37 Stat. 46][/us/stat/37/46]).

    Words “any civil action” were substituted for “all actions, suits, or proceedings,” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    The sentence “The right of appeal shall be allowed to either party as in other cases” was omitted as covered by [section 1291 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1291], relating to appeals to the court of appeals.

    Changes in phraseology were made.
