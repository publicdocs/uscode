## § 1390. Scope

    (a) __Venue Defined.—__ 

    As used in this chapter, the term “venue” refers to the geographic specification of the proper court or courts for the litigation of a civil action that is within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district courts in general, and does not refer to any grant or restriction of subject-matter jurisdiction providing for a civil action to be adjudicated only by the district court for a particular district or districts.

    (b) __Exclusion of Certain Cases.—__ 

    Except as otherwise provided by law, this chapter shall not govern the venue of a civil action in which the district court exercises the jurisdiction conferred by section 1333, except that such civil actions may be transferred between district courts as provided in this chapter.

    (c) __Clarification Regarding Cases Removed From State Courts.—__ 

    This chapter shall not determine the district court to which a civil action pending in a State court may be removed, but shall govern the transfer of an action so removed as between districts and divisions of the United States district courts.

(Added [Pub. L. 112–63, title II, § 201(a)][/us/pl/112/63/s201/a], Dec. 7, 2011, [125 Stat. 762][/us/stat/125/762].)
