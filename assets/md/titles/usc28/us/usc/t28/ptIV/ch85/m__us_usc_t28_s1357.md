## § 1357. Injuries under Federal laws

    The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action commenced by any person to recover damages for any injury to his person or property on account of any act done by him, under any Act of Congress, for the protection or collection of any of the revenues, or to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in any State.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 934][/us/stat/62/934].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 41(11) ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 24][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s24], par. 11, [36 Stat. 1092][/us/stat/36/1092].)

    Words “any civil action” were substituted for “all suits,” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.
