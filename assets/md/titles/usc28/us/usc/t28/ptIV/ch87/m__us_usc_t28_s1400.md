([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 936][/us/stat/62/936]; [Pub. L. 100–702, title X][/us/pl/100/702/tX], § 1020(a)(5), Nov. 19, 1988, [102 Stat. 4671][/us/stat/102/4671]; [Pub. L. 105–304, title V][/us/pl/105/304/tV], § 503(c)(1), (2), Oct. 28, 1998, [112 Stat. 2917][/us/stat/112/2917]; [Pub. L. 106–44][/us/pl/106/44], § 2(a), Aug. 5, 1999, [113 Stat. 223][/us/stat/113/223].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 109, and [section 35 of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s35], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch320], § 35, [35 Stat. 1084][/us/stat/35/1084]; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 48, [36 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/36/1100]).

    Section consolidates [section 35 of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s35], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of [section 109 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s109], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.

    Subsection (b) is based on [section 109 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s109], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with the following changes:

    Words “civil action” were substituted for “suit,” and words “in law or in equity,” after “shall have jurisdiction” were deleted, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Words in subsection (b) “where the defendant resides” were substituted for “of which the defendant is an inhabitant.” A corresponding change was made in subsection (a). Words “inhabitant” and “resident,” as respects venue, are synonymous. (See reviser’s note under [section 1391 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1391].)

    Words “whether a person, partnership, or corporation” before “has committed” were omitted as surplusage.

    The provisions of [section 109 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s109], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to process are incorporated in [section 1694 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1694].

    Jurisdiction and venue of patent suits against residents of foreign countries or persons residing in plurality of districts, see [section 72a of title 35][/us/usc/t35/s72a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Patents.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

Title 17 of the United States Code was enacted into positive law by [act July 30, 1947, ch. 391][/us/act/1947-07-30/ch391], [61 Stat. 652][/us/stat/61/652], and, in such enactment, section 35 of the prior title became section 111 of the new title, and all Acts from which sections of the prior title had been derived, were repealed. Therefore, this paragraph should read: 

> “Based on Title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 109 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 48, [36 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/36/1100]), and [section 111 of Title 17][/us/usc/t17/s111], U.S.C., 1946 ed., Copyrights.”

 By Senate amendment, [section 111 of Title 17][/us/usc/t17/s111] U.S.C., is included in the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—[Pub. L. 106–44][/us/pl/106/44] amended section catchline generally so as to read “Patents and copyrights, mask works, and designs”.

    1998—[Pub. L. 105–304][/us/pl/105/304], § 503(c)(2), amended section catchline generally, substituting “Patents and copyrights, mask works, and designs” for “Patents and copyrights”.

    1988—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 100–702][/us/pl/100/702] inserted “or exclusive rights in mask works” after “copyrights”.
