## § 1369. Multiparty, multiforum jurisdiction

    (a) __In General.—__ 

    The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action involving minimal diversity between adverse parties that arises from a single accident, where at least 75 natural persons have died in the accident at a discrete location, if—

        (1) a defendant resides in a State and a substantial part of the accident took place in another State or other location, regardless of whether that defendant is also a resident of the State where a substantial part of the accident took place;

        (2) any two defendants reside in different States, regardless of whether such defendants are also residents of the same State or States; or

        (3) substantial parts of the accident took place in different States.

    (b) __Limitation of Jurisdiction of District Courts.—__ 

    The district court shall abstain from hearing any civil action described in subsection (a) in which—

        (1) the substantial majority of all plaintiffs are citizens of a single State of which the primary defendants are also citizens; and

        (2) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the laws of that State.

    (c) __Special Rules and Definitions.—__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) minimal diversity exists between adverse parties if any party is a citizen of a State and any adverse party is a citizen of another State, a citizen or subject of a foreign state, or a foreign state as defined in [section 1603(a) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1603/a];

        (2) a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of any State, and a citizen or subject of any foreign state, in which it is incorporated or has its principal place of business, and is deemed to be a resident of any State in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business;

        (3)

         the term “injury” means—

            (A) physical harm to a natural person; and

            (B) physical damage to or destruction of tangible property, but only if physical harm described in subparagraph (A) exists;

        (4) the term “accident” means a sudden accident, or a natural event culminating in an accident, that results in death incurred at a discrete location by at least 75 natural persons; and

        (5) the term “State” includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.

    (d) __Intervening Parties.—__ 

    In any action in a district court which is or could have been brought, in whole or in part, under this section, any person with a claim arising from the accident described in subsection (a) shall be permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff in the action, even if that person could not have brought an action in a district court as an original matter.

    (e) __Notification of Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.—__ 

    A district court in which an action under this section is pending shall promptly notify the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation of the pendency of the action.
