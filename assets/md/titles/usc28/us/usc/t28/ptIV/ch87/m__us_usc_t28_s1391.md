## § 1391. Venue generally

    (a)  __Applicability of Section__  __.—__ 

    Except as otherwise provided by law—

        (1) this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States; and

        (2) the proper venue for a civil action shall be determined without regard to whether the action is local or transitory in nature.

    (b)  __Venue in General__  __.—__ 

    A civil action may be brought in—

        (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located;

        (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or

        (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.

    (c)  __Residency__  __.—__ 

    For all venue purposes—

        (1) a natural person, including an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, shall be deemed to reside in the judicial district in which that person is domiciled;

        (2) an entity with the capacity to sue and be sued in its common name under applicable law, whether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question and, if a plaintiff, only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place of business; and

        (3) a defendant not resident in the United States may be sued in any judicial district, and the joinder of such a defendant shall be disregarded in determining where the action may be brought with respect to other defendants.

    (d)  __Residency of Corporations in States With Multiple Districts__  __.—__ 

    For purposes of venue under this chapter, in a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts.

    (e) __Actions Where Defendant Is Officer or Employee of the United States.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__

Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.

        (2)  __Service__  __.—__ 

        The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 111, 112 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 50, 51, [36 Stat. 1101][/us/stat/36/1101]; [Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 345][/us/act/1922-09-19/ch345], [42 Stat. 849][/us/stat/42/849]; [Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 526][/us/act/1925-03-04/ch526], § 1, [43 Stat. 1264][/us/stat/43/1264]; [Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 230][/us/act/1936-04-16/ch230], [49 Stat. 1213][/us/stat/49/1213]).

    Section consolidates [section 111 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s111], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 112 of such title.

    The portion of [section 112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s112], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue generally constitutes this section and the parts relating to arrest of the defendant, venue and process in stockholders’ actions constitute sections 1401, 1693, and 1695 of this title.

    Provision in [section 111 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s111], U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a district court may proceed as to parties before it although one or more defendants do not reside in the district, and that its judgment shall be without prejudice to such absent defendants, was omitted as covered by rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Word “action” was substituted for “suit” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Word “reside” was substituted for “whereof he is an inhabitant” for clarity inasmuch as “inhabitant” and “resident” are synonymous. (See Ex parte Shaw, 1892, 12 S.Ct. 935, 145 U.S. 444, 36 L.Ed. 768; Standard Stoker Co., Inc. v. Lower, D.C., 1931, 46 F.2d 678; Edgewater Realty Co. v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co., D.C., 1943, 49 F.Supp. 807.)

    Reference to “all plaintiffs” and “all defendants” were substituted for references to “the plaintiff” and “the defendant,” in view of many decisions holding that the singular terms were used in a collective sense. (See Smith v. Lyon, 1890, 10 S.Ct. 303, 133 U.S. 315, 33 L.Ed. 635; Hooe v. Jamieson, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 596, 166 U.S. 395, 41 L.Ed. 1049; and Fetzer v. Livermore, D.C., 1926, 15 F.2d 462.)

    In subsection (c), references to defendants “found” within a district or voluntarily appearing were omitted. The use of the word “found” made [section 111 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s111], U.S.C., 1940 ed., ambiguous. The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was “found,” was rejected in Camp v. Gress, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.

    Subsection (d) of this section is added to give statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning a rule of venue as to which there has been a sharp conflict of decisions. (See Sandusky Foundry & Machine Co. v. DeLavand, 1918, D.C.Ohio, 251 F. 631, 632, and cases cited. See also Keating v. Pennsylvania Co., 1917, D.C.Ohio, 245 F. 155 and cases cited.)

    Changes were made in phraseology.
