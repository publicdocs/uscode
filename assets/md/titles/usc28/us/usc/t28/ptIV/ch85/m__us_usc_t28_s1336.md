    (b) When a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims refers a question or issue to the Surface Transportation Board for determination, the court which referred the question or issue shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a civil action to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Surface Transportation Board arising out of such referral.

    (c) Any action brought under subsection (b) of this section shall be filed within 90 days from the date that the order of the Surface Transportation Board becomes final.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 931][/us/stat/62/931]; [Pub. L. 88–513, § 1][/us/pl/88/513/s1], Aug. 30, 1964, [78 Stat. 695][/us/stat/78/695]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 41(27), (28) ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 24(27), (28), 207, [36 Stat. 1091][/us/stat/36/1091], 1148; [Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32][/us/act/1913-10-22/ch32], [38 Stat. 219][/us/stat/38/219]).

    Words “Except as otherwise provided by enactment of Congress” were inserted because of certain similar cases of which the courts of appeals are given jurisdiction. (See, for example, [section 21 of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s21], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade.)

    Words “any civil action” were substituted for “all cases” and “cases” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
