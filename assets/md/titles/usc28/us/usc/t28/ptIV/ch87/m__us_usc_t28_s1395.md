([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 936][/us/stat/62/936].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 104, 106, 107, and 108, and [section 3745(c) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3745/c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 43, 45, 46, 47, [36 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/36/1100]; [Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, § 3745(c)][/us/act/1939-02-10/ch2/s3745/c], [53 Stat. 460][/us/stat/53/460]).

    This section consolidates [section 3745(c) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3745/c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with sections 104, 106, 107, and 108 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue in civil proceedings to recover and enforce civil fines, penalties, and forfeitures, pecuniary or otherwise. Subsection (a) is based on said [section 104 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s104] and said [section 3745(c) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3745/c]. Subsections (b) and (c) consolidate such sections 106 and 107 of title 28. Subsection (e) is based on such [section 108 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s108].

    Subsection (b) substituted words “may be prosecuted in any district where such property is found” for “shall be prosecuted in the district where the seizure is made,” to include not only property seized, but also all other property subject to forfeiture.

    Words “civil” and “fine” were inserted to make this section applicable to the many provisions of the United States Code for fines essentially civil. (See reviser’s note under [section 1355 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1355].)

    Provisions of [section 3745(c) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3745/c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., that such suit may be brought “before any other court of competent jurisdiction” were omitted as misleading surplusage, since United States district courts, under [section 1355 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1355], have exclusive jurisdiction.

    Subsection (d) was added for completeness and clarity.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    While [section 3745(c) of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s3745/c], U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, is one of the sources of this section, it was eliminated from the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. Therefore, such section 3745(c) remains in Title 26. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
