## § 1349. Corporation organized under federal law as party

    The district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action by or against any corporation upon the ground that it was incorporated by or under an Act of Congress, unless the United States is the owner of more than one-half of its capital stock.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 934][/us/stat/62/934].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 42 ([Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, § 12][/us/act/1925-02-13/ch229/s12], [43 Stat. 941][/us/stat/43/941]).

    Words “civil action” were substituted for “action or suit,” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.
