## § 1449. State court record supplied

    Where a party is entitled to copies of the rec­ords and proceedings in any suit or prosecution in a State court, to be used in any district court of the United States, and the clerk of such State court, upon demand, and the payment or tender of the legal fees, fails to deliver certified copies, the district court may, on affidavit reciting such facts, direct such record to be supplied by affidavit or otherwise. Thereupon such proceedings, trial, and judgment may be had in such district court, and all such process awarded, as if certified copies had been filed in the district court.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 940][/us/stat/62/940]; [May 24, 1949, ch. 139][/us/act/1949-05-24/ch139], § 85, [63 Stat. 102][/us/stat/63/102].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 78 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 35, [36 Stat. 1098][/us/stat/36/1098]).

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section corrects a typographical error by eliminating from [section 1449 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1449], U.S.C., the words “any attachment or sequestration of the”, which had been inadvertently included, and inserting in lieu thereof the words, “and the clerk of such State court, upon”.

 __Amendments__ 

    1949—Act May 24, 1949, substituted “and the clerk of such State court, upon” for “any attachment or sequestration of the”.
