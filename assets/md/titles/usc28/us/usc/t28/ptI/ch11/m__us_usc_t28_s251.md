 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 296 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 187(a)][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s187/a], as added [Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, § 1][/us/act/1940-10-10/ch843/s1], [54 Stat. 1101][/us/stat/54/1101]).

    This section contains only a part of [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 252, 253, 254, 455, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.

    The provision that vacancies should be filled by appointment of the President and confirmed by the Senate was omitted as unnecessary in view of the language of the revised section.

    Words “a court of record known as” were added. (See Reviser’s Note under [section 171 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s171].)

    The term “chief judge” was substituted for “presiding judge.” (See reviser’s note under [section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s136].)

    The provisions of such [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to assignment and powers of retired judges were omitted as covered by sections 294 and 296 of this title.

The chief judge shall continue to serve as chief judge until he reaches the age of seventy years and another judge is designated as chief judge by the President. After the designation of another judge to serve as chief judge, the former chief judge may continue to serve as a judge of the court.”
