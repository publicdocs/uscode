## § 138. Terms abolished

    The district court shall not hold formal terms.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 897][/us/stat/62/897]; [Pub. L. 88–139][/us/pl/88/139], § 1, Oct. 16, 1963, [77 Stat. 248][/us/stat/77/248].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    This section was substituted for a number of special provisions fixing stated times for holding terms of court in the several districts, in order to vest in the courts wider discretion and promote greater efficiency in the administration of the business of such courts.

 __Amendments__ 

    1963—[Pub. L. 88–139][/us/pl/88/139] substituted “The district court shall not hold formal terms” for “The times for holding regular terms of court at the places fixed by this chapter shall be determined by rule of the district court” in text, and “Terms abolished” for “Times for holding regular terms” in section catchline.
