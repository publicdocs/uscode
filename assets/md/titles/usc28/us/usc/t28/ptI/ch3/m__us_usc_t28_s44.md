 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 213, and sections 11–201, 11–202, District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. ([Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, § 1][/us/act/1893-02-09/ch74/s1], [27 Stat. 434][/us/stat/27/434]; [Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854][/us/act/1901-03-03/ch854], §§ 221, 222, [31 Stat. 1224][/us/stat/31/1224]; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 118][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s118], [36 Stat. 1131][/us/stat/36/1131]; [Jan. 13, 1912, ch. 9][/us/act/1912-01-13/ch9], [37 Stat. 52][/us/stat/37/52]; [Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, § 2][/us/act/1919-02-25/ch29/s2], [40 Stat. 1156][/us/stat/40/1156]; [Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, § 6][/us/act/1922-09-14/ch306/s6], [42 Stat. 840][/us/stat/42/840]; [Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 437][/us/act/1925-03-03/ch437], [43 Stat. 1116][/us/stat/43/1116]; [Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, § 1][/us/act/1926-12-13/ch6/s1], [44 Stat. 919][/us/stat/44/919]; [Feb. 28, 1929, ch. 363, § 2][/us/act/1929-02-28/ch363/s2], [45 Stat. 1347][/us/stat/45/1347]; [Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 413][/us/act/1929-03-01/ch413], §§ 1, 2, [45 Stat. 1414][/us/stat/45/1414]; [June 10, 1930, ch. 437][/us/act/1930-06-10/ch437], [46 Stat. 538][/us/stat/46/538]; [June 10, 1930, ch. 438][/us/act/1930-06-10/ch438], [46 Stat. 538][/us/stat/46/538]; [June 19, 1930, ch. 538][/us/act/1930-06-19/ch538], [46 Stat. 785][/us/stat/46/785]; [June 16, 1933, ch. 102][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch102], [48 Stat. 310][/us/stat/48/310]; [Aug. 2, 1935, ch. 425, § 1][/us/act/1935-08-02/ch425/s1], [49 Stat. 508][/us/stat/49/508]; [June 24, 1936, ch. 735, § 1][/us/act/1936-06-24/ch735/s1], [49 Stat. 1903][/us/stat/49/1903]; [Apr. 14, 1937, ch. 80][/us/act/1937-04-14/ch80], [50 Stat. 64][/us/stat/50/64]; [May 31, 1938, ch. 290][/us/act/1938-05-31/ch290], §§ 1, 3, [52 Stat. 584][/us/stat/52/584], 585; [May 24, 1940, ch. 209, § 1][/us/act/1940-05-24/ch209/s1], [54 Stat. 219][/us/stat/54/219]; [Dec. 14, 1942, ch. 731][/us/act/1942-12-14/ch731], [56 Stat. 1050][/us/stat/56/1050]; [Dec. 7, 1944, ch. 521, § 1][/us/act/1944-12-07/ch521/s1], [58 Stat. 796][/us/stat/58/796]; [July 31, 1946, ch. 704, § 1][/us/act/1946-07-31/ch704/s1], [60 Stat. 716][/us/stat/60/716]).

    This section includes the members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and designates them as “judges” rather than as “justices”, thus harmonizing it with the provisions of [section 41 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s41], which specifically designates the District of Columbia as a judicial circuit of the United States. In doing so it consolidates sections 11–201, 11–202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., which provided for one “chief justice” and five associate “justices.”

    Act February 9, 1893, established a court of appeals for the District of Columbia to consist of one chief justice and two associate justices whose jurisdiction was almost entirely to review the judgments of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, the name of which was changed in 1936 to the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. Circuit courts were established by the first Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, § 4, and R.S. § 608, enacted June 22, 1874. R.S. § 605 provided that the words “circuit justice” and “justice of a circuit” should designate the justice of the Supreme Court of the United States allotted to any circuit; that “judge” when applied to any circuit included such justice.

    The Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1945, [Act June 26, 1944, ch. 277, § 202][/us/act/1944-06-26/ch277/s202], [58 Stat. 358][/us/stat/58/358], provided that as used in that Act, “the term ‘circuit court of appeals’ includes the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; the term ‘senior circuit judge’ includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term ‘circuit judge’ includes associate justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term ‘judge’ includes justice.”

    Provisions in section 11–202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and [section 213 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s213], U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of salaries in monthly installments were omitted, since time of payment is a matter of administrative convenience (20 Comp. Gen. 834).

    The exception in subsection (c) extends to circuit judges in the District of Columbia the effect of the recent decision in U.S. ex rel. Laughlin v. Eicher, D.C. 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of [section 1 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1], U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See Reviser’s Note under [section 134 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s134].)

    The provision in section 213 of the title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that “it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law,” was omitted as unnecessary since the duty to serve is implied by the creation and composition of the court in [section 43 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s43].

    Last sentence, providing that nothing in [section 213 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s213], U.S.C., 1940 ed., should prevent a circuit judge from holding district court as provided by law, was omitted as unnecessary. (See [section 291 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s291] authorizing assignments to district courts.)

    Subsection (b) was added in conformity with the U.S. Constitution, art. 3.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
