L. 104–140][/us/pl/104/140], § 1(a), May 2, 1996, [110 Stat. 1327][/us/stat/110/1327]; [Pub. L. 110–406][/us/pl/110/406], § 9, Oct. 13, 2008, [122 Stat. 4293][/us/stat/122/4293].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 449, 450 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 307, 308, as added [Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501][/us/act/1939-08-07/ch501], § 1, [53 Stat. 1223][/us/stat/53/1223]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 449 and 450 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Said section 450 contained definitions of “courts” and “continental United States,” and directions that sections 444–450 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the administration of United States courts, should apply to the courts of appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and to the several enumerated district courts of the United States, including those in the Territories and Possessions as well as the Court of Claims, Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and Customs Court. It also provided that the Chief Justice and associate justices of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia should have the powers of the senior judge and circuit judges, respectively, of a circuit court of appeals.

    The revised section omits, as surplusage, the definition of “continental United States.” Other provisions of [section 450 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s450], U.S.C., 1940 ed., referred to were omitted as unnecessary in view of [section 604 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s604] which provides for the powers and duties of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Remaining provisions of said section 450 are incorporated in said section 604 and [section 610 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s610].

    The provision as to travel and subsistence which was contained in said [section 449 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s449], U.S.C., 1940 ed., is incorporated in [section 456 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s456].
