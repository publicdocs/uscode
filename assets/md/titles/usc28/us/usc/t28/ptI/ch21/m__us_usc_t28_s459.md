## § 459. Administration of oaths and acknowledgments

    Each justice or judge of the United States may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 908][/us/stat/62/908].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 264, 385, [section 1509 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1509], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, and [section 1114(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1114/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 158, 268, [36 Stat. 1139][/us/stat/36/1139], 1163; [June 17, 1930, ch. 497][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch497], title IV, § 509, [46 Stat. 733][/us/stat/46/733]; [Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, § 1114(a)][/us/act/1939-02-10/ch2/s1114/a], [53 Stat. 160][/us/stat/53/160]; [Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 619][/us/act/1942-10-21/ch619], title V, § 504(a), (c), [56 Stat. 957][/us/stat/56/957]; [Feb. 25, 1944, ch. 63][/us/act/1944-02-25/ch63], title V, § 503, [58 Stat. 72][/us/stat/58/72]).

    Section consolidates provisions of sections 264 and 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., [section 1509 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1509], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and [section 1114(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1114/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to administration of oaths and acknowledgments by judges and courts.

    The provision of [section 385 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s385], U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to “all courts of the United States” power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title. The remainder is incorporated in section 401 of revised title 18, U.S.C. (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.), Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

    [Section 264 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s264], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Court of Claims and provision of such section relating to clerks and deputies is incorporated in [section 953 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s953].

    [Section 1509 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1509], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Customs Court.

    [Section 1114(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1114/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to The Tax Court. That portion of such section authorizing certain employees of The Tax Court to administer oaths and acknowledgments is incorporated in [section 953 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s953]. For distribution of other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

    The revised section clarifies what was apparently a statutory omission in that no provision was made with reference to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the judges of which now will have the same power respecting administering oaths as judges of other courts.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated, therefore, as finally enacted, [section 1114(a) of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1114/a], U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, did not constitute part of the source of this section. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
