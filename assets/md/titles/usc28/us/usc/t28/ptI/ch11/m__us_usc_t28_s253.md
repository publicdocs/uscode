 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 296 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 187(a), as added [Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843][/us/act/1940-10-10/ch843], § 1, [54 Stat. 1101][/us/stat/54/1101]).

    This section contains a part of [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 252, 254, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.

    Provision respecting recommendations for appointment, promotions, or otherwise affecting such clerical force, was omitted as unnecessary in view of [section 871 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s871].

    The second paragraph is partly new and conforms with similar provisions of [section 136(e) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s136/e], relating to the chief judges of district courts.

    The term “chief judge” was substituted for “presiding judge.” (See Reviser’s Note under [section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s136].)

    Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–317][/us/pl/104/317] struck out “; precedence of judges” after “chief judge” in section catchline and struck out subsecs. (d) and (e) which read as follows:

    “(d) Whenever the chief judge is unable to perform the duties of his office or the office is vacant, his powers and duties shall devolve upon the judge next in precedence who is able to act, until such disability is removed or another chief judge is appointed and duly qualified.

    “(e) The chief judge shall have precedence and shall preside at any session which he attends. Other judges shall have precedence and shall preside according to the seniority of their commissions. Judges whose commissions bear the same date shall have precedence according to seniority in age.”

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–417][/us/pl/96/417] redesignated the Customs Court as the Court of International Trade.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–271][/us/pl/91/271] reorganized existing provisions into lettered subsecs. (a) to (e) and made minor changes in phraseology.

    1959—[Pub. L. 86–243][/us/pl/86/243] required the chief judge to supervise the fiscal affairs and clerical force of the court, with the approval of the court.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__
