 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 188 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 107, [36 Stat. 1124][/us/stat/36/1124]; [Aug. 20, 1912, ch. 306][/us/act/1912-08-20/ch306], [37 Stat. 314][/us/stat/37/314]; [June 22, 1916, ch. 161][/us/act/1916-06-22/ch161], [39 Stat. 232][/us/stat/39/232]; [Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 289][/us/act/1923-03-04/ch289], [42 Stat. 1520][/us/stat/42/1520]; [May 17, 1926, ch. 310][/us/act/1926-05-17/ch310], [44 Stat. 561][/us/stat/44/561]; [Mar. 1, 1927, ch. 244][/us/act/1927-03-01/ch244], [44 Stat. 1262][/us/stat/44/1262]; [May 13, 1932, ch. 179][/us/act/1932-05-13/ch179], [47 Stat. 153][/us/stat/47/153]; [June 16, 1933, ch. 94][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch94], [48 Stat. 253][/us/stat/48/253]; [July 30, 1937, ch. 539][/us/act/1937-07-30/ch539], [50 Stat. 546][/us/stat/50/546]; [June 12, 1940, ch. 341][/us/act/1940-06-12/ch341], [54 Stat. 348][/us/stat/54/348]; [Nov. 27, 1940, ch. 920][/us/act/1940-11-27/ch920], § 1, [54 Stat. 1216][/us/stat/54/1216]; [Dec. 3, 1943, ch. 332][/us/act/1943-12-03/ch332], [57 Stat. 595][/us/stat/57/595]).

    Words “The said judge shall possess the same powers, perform the same duties, and receive the same compensation as other district judges,” and words, “The President is authorized to appoint, by and with the consent of the Senate, a successor or successors to said judge as vacancies may occur. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent said judge or his successors from becoming the senior district judge by succession, or from exercising the powers and rights of senior district judge of said district. The judge designated herein to hold regular and special terms of court at Winchester and Chattanooga shall make all necessary orders for the disposition of business and assignment of cases for trial in said divisions,” were deleted as superfluous, in view of sections 132 and 141 of this title.

    Words “The district attorneys and marshals for the eastern, middle, and western districts of Tennessee in office immediately prior to November 27, 1940, shall be during the remainder of their present terms of office the district attorneys and marshals for such districts as constituted by this section. The district judge for the middle district of Tennessee shall be the district judge for the middle district of Tennessee as constituted by this section and shall hold regular and special terms of court at Nashville, Columbia, and Cookeville. The district judge for the western district of Tennessee shall hold regular and special terms of court at Memphis and Jackson,” at the end of the section, were deleted as temporary, and as superfluous, in view of the remainder of the section, prescribing the places for holding terms of court.

    A provision for furnishing rooms and accommodations by the local authorities for holding court at Columbia “but only until such time as such accommodations shall be provided upon the recommendation of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in a public building or other quarters provided by the Federal Government for such purpose,” was omitted on advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that Federal accommodations are now available.

    An identical provision with reference to Winchester is retained in part, but the words quoted above were omitted as unnecessary since, when such buildings become available, the Director will, under [section 604 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s604], provide court accommodations therein.

    The last paragraph of the revised section consolidates the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of [section 188 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s188], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the terms of court to be held in the two divisions of the eastern district by the two judges, and their respective powers of appointment of court officers and employees.

    Provisions relating to appointment and residence of deputy marshals and maintenance of clerk’s office, were omitted as covered by sections 542 \[see 561\] and 751 of this title.

    The clerk of court in a letter dated February 7, 1945, calls attention to a rule of court providing for hearing of all bankruptcy matters arising in Haywood County at Jackson in the eastern division of the western district.

    The provision respecting court accommodations at Winchester was omitted as covered by [section 142 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s142].

    Changes in arrangement and phraseology were made.
