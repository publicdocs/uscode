## § 82. Arizona

    Arizona constitutes one judicial district.

    Court shall be held at Globe, Phoenix, Prescott, and Tucson.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 874][/us/stat/62/874].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 143 ([June 20, 1910, ch. 310][/us/act/1910-06-20/ch310], § 31, [36 Stat. 576][/us/stat/36/576]; [Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 17][/us/act/1913-10-03/ch17], §§ 1, 2, [38 Stat. 203][/us/stat/38/203]).

    A provision for transfer of causes, civil or criminal, from one place for holding court to another was omitted. Such provision, as to civil cases, is covered by [section 1404 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1404], and, as to criminal cases, is rendered unnecessary because of inherent power of the court and Rules 18–20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, relating to venue.

    A provision for making an interlocutory order at any place designated for holding court was omitted as unnecessary in view of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 77(b).

    A provision requiring the clerk to keep his office at the State capital was omitted as covered by [section 751 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s751].

    Changes in arrangement and phraseology were made.
