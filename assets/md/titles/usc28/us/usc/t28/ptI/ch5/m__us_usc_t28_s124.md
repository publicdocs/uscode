    Words “and all prosecutions against persons for offenses committed in the county of Reagan shall be tried in the court at San Angelo: Provided, That no civil or criminal cause begun and pending prior to May 29, 1924, shall be in any way affected,” words “and all prosecutions against persons for offenses committed in the county of Pecos shall be tried in the district court at El Paso, or Pecos City: Provided, That no civil or criminal cause begun and pending prior to March 2, 1923, shall be in any way affected,” and words “Provided, That no civil or criminal cause commenced prior to June 24, 1930, shall be in any way affected,” were all deleted as superseded by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules 18–22, and as obsolete, in view of the lapse of time after the dates included in such provisions.

    Provisions for furnishing rooms and accommodations at Pecos and Wichita Falls were omitted as obsolete, on advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that Federal accommodations are now available at such places.

    Provisions relating to the maintenance of offices at various cities by the clerks were omitted as covered by sections 452 and 751 of this title.

    Provisions that process against residents of Pecos County shall issue from and be returnable to the court at Pecos City and against residents of Reagan County at San Angelo, were omitted since such matter can be regulated more appropriately by court rule or order. (See Rule 4 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.)

    The provisions requiring notice to be given for time of holding court in Pecos division and at Corpus Christi, were omitted as covered by [section 141 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s141].

    Five counties included in this section were created since the enactment of [section 189 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s189]. These were Kleberg County and Kenedy County of the Corpus Christi division of the southern district, Culberson County and Hudspeth County of the El Paso division of the western district, and Real County of the San Antonio division of the western district. Pecos County is included in the Pecos division and omitted from the El Paso division of the western district to conform to the practice of the court.
