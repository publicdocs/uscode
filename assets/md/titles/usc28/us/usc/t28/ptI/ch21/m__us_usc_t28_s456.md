    [Section 270 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s270], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to the Chief Justice and each judge of the Court of Claims and provided for payment of expenses on order of court.

    Sections 296, 296a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for payment of such expenses of the Customs Court judges.

    [Section 302 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s302], U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for the payment of expenses of a judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals upon his certificate. It contained no $10 limitation upon his daily subsistence expense and in addition authorized the necessary expenses for travel and attendance of one stenographic clerk who accompanied him. This latter provision is the basis for [section 834 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s834]. Other provisions of said [section 302 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s302], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 214 and 452 of this title.

    [Section 374 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s374], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to circuit justices, circuit judges and district judges, including district judges in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. References to these territories is omitted as unnecessary. Provision for Alaska judges is covered by [section 460 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s460], and [section 114 of title 48][/us/usc/t48/s114], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, as amended by a separate section in the bill to enact this revision. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are included as districts by sections 91 and 119 of this title, and judges thereof are “judges of the United States” as defined in [section 451 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s451].

    The inconsistent provision of said [section 270 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s270], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to payment on order of court was omitted to permit payment to every judge on his certificate.

    The $10 per day subsistence limitation applicable to all other judges was extended to the judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

    The provision of said [section 270 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s270], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to traveling expenses of commissioners and stenographers is incorporated in sections 792 and 794 of this title.

    The provisions of said [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 940 ed., relating to organization of the Customs Court are the basis of sections 251, 252, 253, and 254 of this title. Other provisions of said section 296 are incorporated in sections 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title, and the retirement provisions of that section are covered by sections 371 and 372 of this title.

    The provision of [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 1940 ed., expenses of retired judges was made applicable to all judges.

    The provision of [section 218 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s218], U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of travel expenses of judges attending the Judicial Conference of the United States was omitted as covered by the first paragraph of the revised section.

    The provision in [section 218 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s218], U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the marshal of the Supreme Court to pay the expenses of attending the Judicial Conference of the United States is omitted as covered in part by section 550 \[see 571\] of this title under which United States marshals pay the travel allowances of circuit, district, and certain other judges. The expenses of the Chief Justice of the United States in attending such Conference were required also under said section 218 to be paid by the Supreme Court marshal. Such requirement is also omitted upon advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that the matter of payment is one of administrative convenience. As to manner of payment of salaries to active and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, see reviser’s note under section 550 \[see 571\] of this title.

    Words “justice or judge of the United States” were used to describe members of all courts. See definitive [section 451 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s451].

    The remaining provisions of sections 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the Judicial Conference of the United States and 449 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to judicial conferences of circuits, are incorporated in sections 331 and 333, respectively.

    Said [section 1102(d) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1102/d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to traveling and subsistence expenses of judges of The Tax Court of the United States, successor to the Board of Tax Appeals.

    Numerous changes were made in phraseology.

 __Senate Revision Amendments__ 

    Those provisions of this section which related to the Tax Court were eliminated by Senate amendment, therefore [section 1102(d) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1102/d], U.S.C., was not one of the sources of this section as finally enacted.

    As finally enacted, part of [act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV][/us/act/1947-07-09/ch211/tIV], [61 Stat. 303][/us/stat/61/303], which was classified to title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 296a, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment.
