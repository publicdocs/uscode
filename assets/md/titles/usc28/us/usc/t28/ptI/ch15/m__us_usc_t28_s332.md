## § 332. Judicial councils of circuits

    (a)

        (1) The chief judge of each judicial circuit shall call, at least twice in each year and at such places as he or she may designate, a meeting of the judicial council of the circuit, consisting of the chief judge of the circuit, who shall preside, and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit, as such number is determined by majority vote of all such judges of the circuit in regular active service.

        (2) Members of the council shall serve for terms established by a majority vote of all judges of the circuit in regular active service.

        (3) Except for the chief judge of the circuit, either judges in regular active service or judges retired from regular active service under [section 371(b) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s371/b] may serve as members of the council. Service as a member of a judicial council by a judge retired from regular active service under section 371(b) may not be considered for meeting the requirements of section 371(f)(1)(A), (B), or (C). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

        (4) No more than one district judge from any one district shall serve simultaneously on the council, unless at least one district judge from each district within the circuit is already serving as a member of the council.

        (5) In the event of the death, resignation, retirement under section 371(a) or 372(a) of this title, or disability of a member of the council, a replacement member shall be designated to serve the remainder of the unexpired term by the chief judge of the circuit.

        (6) Each member of the council shall attend each council meeting unless excused by the chief judge of the circuit.

    (b) The council shall be known as the Judicial Council of the circuit.

    (d)

        (1) Each judicial council shall make all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice within its circuit. Any general order relating to practice and procedure shall be made or amended only after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment. Any such order so relating shall take effect upon the date specified by such judicial council. Copies of such orders so relating shall be furnished to the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and be made available to the public. Each council is authorized to hold hearings, to take sworn testimony, and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum. Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum shall be issued by the clerk of the court of appeals, at the direction of the chief judge of the circuit or his designee and under the seal of the court, and shall be served in the manner provided in rule 45(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof.

        (2) All judicial officers and employees of the circuit shall promptly carry into effect all orders of the judicial council.

        (2) The circuit executive shall serve at the pleasure of the judicial council of the circuit.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 448 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 306][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s306], as added [Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, § 1][/us/act/1939-08-07/ch501/s1], [53 Stat. 1223][/us/stat/53/1223]).

    The final sentence of [section 448 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s448], U.S.C., 1940 ed., excepting from the operation of said section the provisions of existing law as to assignment of district judges outside their districts, was omitted as surplusage, since there is nothing in this section in conflict with [section 292 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s292] providing for such assignments.

    The requirement for attendance of circuit judges, unless excused by the chief judge, was included in conformity with a similar provision of [section 331 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s331].

    Changes in phraseology were made.
