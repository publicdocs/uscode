 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 194 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 113][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s113], [36 Stat. 1129][/us/stat/36/1129]; [Mar. 23, 1912, ch. 63][/us/act/1912-03-23/ch63], [37 Stat. 76][/us/stat/37/76]; [Aug. 22, 1914, ch. 265][/us/act/1914-08-22/ch265], [38 Stat. 702][/us/stat/38/702]; [Feb. 27, 1922, ch. 83][/us/act/1922-02-27/ch83], [42 Stat. 398][/us/stat/42/398]; [June 22, 1936, ch. 695][/us/act/1936-06-22/ch695], [49 Stat. 1805][/us/stat/49/1805]; [Aug. 23, 1937, ch. 737][/us/act/1937-08-23/ch737], [50 Stat. 744][/us/stat/50/744]; [June 29, 1938, ch. 817][/us/act/1938-06-29/ch817], [52 Stat. 1245][/us/stat/52/1245]).

    Words “with the waters thereof,” after the list of counties in each district, were omitted as unnecessary, and in view of the absence of such words in similar sections relating to other States.

    Provisions relating to special terms of court were omitted as covered by [section 141 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s141].

    A provision that the term at Fairmont be held “when suitable rooms and accommodations for holding terms of the court shall be furnished at Fairmont free of cost to the United States or until, subject to the recommendation of the Attorney General of the United States with respect to providing such rooms and accommodations for holding court at Fairmont, a Federal building containing such suitable rooms and accommodations for holding court shall be erected at such place,” was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that Federal accommodations are now available.

    Provisions respecting court accommodations at Beckley and Lewisburg were omitted as covered by [section 142 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s142].

    Changes were made in arrangement and phrase­ology.
