## § 414. Transmittal of books to successors

    All government publications and law books furnished to justices, judges, clerks of courts, and United States attorneys of the United States and its territories and possessions, and other officers of the United States or an agency thereof shall be transmitted to their successors in office. All permanent or bound books and publications furnished under this chapter except those books furnished to the Library of Congress for international exchange shall remain the property of the United States and shall be marked plainly, “The Property of the United States”.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 906][/us/stat/62/906]; [Pub. L. 87–845, § 7][/us/pl/87/845/s7], Oct. 18, 1962, [76A Stat. 699][/us/stat/76A/699].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 90 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s90], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, [section 530 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s530], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and [section 92 of title 44][/us/usc/t44/s92], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents ([Aug. 7, 1882, ch. 433, § 1][/us/act/1882-08-07/ch433/s1], [22 Stat. 336][/us/stat/22/336]; [Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, § 74][/us/act/1895-01-12/ch23/s74], [28 Stat. 620][/us/stat/28/620]; [June 20, 1936, ch. 630][/us/act/1936-06-20/ch630], §§ 11, 12, [49 Stat. 1552][/us/stat/49/1552], 1553; [May 14, 1940, ch. 189][/us/act/1940-05-14/ch189], title IV, [54 Stat. 210][/us/stat/54/210]; [June 28, 1941, ch. 258][/us/act/1941-06-28/ch258], title IV, [55 Stat. 301][/us/stat/55/301]; [July 2, 1942, ch. 472][/us/act/1942-07-02/ch472], title IV, [56 Stat. 504][/us/stat/56/504]; [June 28, 1943, ch. 173][/us/act/1943-06-28/ch173], title II, § 201, [57 Stat. 243][/us/stat/57/243]; [June 26, 1944, ch. 277, § 203][/us/act/1944-06-26/ch277/s203], [58 Stat. 358][/us/stat/58/358]; [May 21, 1945, ch. 129][/us/act/1945-05-21/ch129], title IV, [59 Stat. 200][/us/stat/59/200]; [July 5, 1946, ch. 541][/us/act/1946-07-05/ch541], title IV, [60 Stat. 480][/us/stat/60/480]).

    Section consolidates [section 90 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s90], U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that “statutes” shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of [section 530 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s530], U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with [section 92 of title 44][/us/usc/t44/s92], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of “Government publications.”

    Words “All Government publications and lawbooks” and “furnished under this chapter” were used to cover “all statutes” and “The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.”

    Words “justices and judges of the United States” were substituted for “United States judges” in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary. Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.

    Other provisions of said [section 530 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s530], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser’s note under [section 413 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s413].)

    The words “permanent or bound” were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    As finally enacted, part of [act July 9, 1947, ch. 211][/us/act/1947-07-09/ch211], title IV, [61 Stat. 306][/us/stat/61/306], which was classified to Title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 530, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

 __Amendments__ 

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–845][/us/pl/87/845] substituted “furnished to justices, judges, clerks of courts, and United States attorneys of the United States and its territories and possessions, and other officers of the United States or an agency thereof” for “furnished to justices and judges of the United States and of the Territorial Courts, United States attorneys, clerks of courts, and other officers of the United States”.

 __Effective Date of 1962 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 87–845, § 25][/us/pl/87/845/s25], Oct. 18, 1962, [76A Stat. 701][/us/stat/76A/701], provided that: 

> “This Act \[enacting [section 4210 of Title 18][/us/usc/t18/s4210], Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and [section 858 of Title 50][/us/usc/t50/s858], War and National Defense, and amending this section, sections 547, 1404, and 1406 of this title, [section 14 of Title 18][/us/usc/t18/s14], [section 1934 of Title 22][/us/usc/t22/s1934], Foreign Relations and Intercourse, [section 196 of Title 24][/us/usc/t24/s196], Hospitals and Asylums, and sections 191a and 191b of Title 50\] takes effect January 2, 1963. Laws enacted after January 9, 1962, that are inconsistent with this Act, supersede it to the extent of the inconsistency.”
