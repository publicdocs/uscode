 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 324 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 218, [36 Stat. 1152][/us/stat/36/1152]; [Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6][/us/act/1926-12-13/ch6], § 1, [44 Stat. 919][/us/stat/44/919]; [July 31, 1946, ch. 704][/us/act/1946-07-31/ch704], § 1, [60 Stat. 716][/us/stat/60/716]).
