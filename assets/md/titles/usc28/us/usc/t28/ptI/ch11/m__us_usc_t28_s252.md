    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 296 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 187(a)][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s187/a], as added [Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, § 1][/us/act/1940-10-10/ch843/s1], [54 Stat. 1101][/us/stat/54/1101]; [July 31, 1946, ch. 704, § 1][/us/act/1946-07-31/ch704/s1], [60 Stat. 716][/us/stat/60/716]).

    This section contains a part of [section 296 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s296], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 253, 254, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.

    A provision exempting judge’s salaries from section 1790 of the Revised Statutes was omitted, as such section was repealed by [act Aug. 26, 1935, ch. 689, § 1][/us/act/1935-08-26/ch689/s1], [49 Stat. 864][/us/stat/49/864].
