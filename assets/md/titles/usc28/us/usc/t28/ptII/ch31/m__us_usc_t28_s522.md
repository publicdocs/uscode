    The words “The Attorney General . . . shall report” are substituted for “It shall be the duty of the Attorney General to make . . . a report”. The word “beginning” is substituted for “commencement”. The words “pertaining to the Department that he considers proper” are substituted for “appertaining thereto that he may deem proper”.

    In paragraph (3), the words “involving the United States” are inserted for clarity. The function of reporting on all cases pending in the United States courts is now vested in the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, see [28 U.S.C. 604][/us/usc/t28/s604].
