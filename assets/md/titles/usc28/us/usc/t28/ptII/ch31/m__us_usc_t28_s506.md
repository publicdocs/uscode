    The words “There shall be in the Department of Justice” are omitted as unnecessary as the title of the positions establishes their location in the Department of Justice.

    The position of sixth Assistant Attorney General, referred to in the Acts of July 16, 1914, and Mar. 4, 1915, was made a permanent position by the [Act of Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 141, § 6][/us/act/1915-03-04/ch141/s6], [38 Stat. 1049][/us/stat/38/1049].

    The number of Assistant Attorneys General referred to in the Act of Mar. 2, 1943, is changed from “six” to “nine” to reflect the three additional Assistant Attorneys General authorized by 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 2, 1953 Reorg. Plan No. 4, and the Act of Sept. 9, 1957.

    The words “learned in the law” are omitted as unnecessary. Such a requirement is not made of the Attorney General, United States attorneys, or United States judges. (See reviser’s note under [28 U.S.C. 501][/us/usc/t28/s501], 1964 ed.)

    The reference in former [section 295 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s295] to the Assistant Attorneys General assisting the Solicitor General are omitted on authority of the transfer of functions made by 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 2 and 1953 Reorg. Plan No. 4.

    Provisions of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 2, § 4, and 1953 Reorg. Plan No. 4, § 2, abolishing positions and transferring incumbents are omitted as executed.

    Provisions relating to pay of Assistant Attorneys General are omitted as superseded by [§ 303(d) of the Act of August 14, 1964][/us/act/1964-08-14/s303/d], [Pub. L. 88–426][/us/pl/88/426], [78 Stat. 418][/us/stat/78/418], which is codified in [section 5315 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5315], United States Code.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 506, [act June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 909][/us/stat/62/909], related to vacancies in the office of United States attorney, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 89–554, § 8(a)][/us/pl/89/554/s8/a], and reenactment in [section 546 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s546] by [section 4(c) of Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554/s4/c].

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–177][/us/pl/109/177] substituted “11” for “ten”.

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598] substituted “ten” for “nine”.

 __Effective Date of 1978 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598] effective Nov. 6, 1978, see [section 402(d) of Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598/s402/d], set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 11][/us/usc/t11/s101], Bankruptcy.
