 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Prior section 504.—Based on [section 315 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s315], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 482, and sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (R.S. §§ 366, 769; [June 24, 1898, ch. 495, § 1][/us/act/1898-06-24/ch495/s1], [30 Stat. 487][/us/stat/30/487]; [Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, § 34][/us/act/1900-04-12/ch191/s34], [31 Stat. 85][/us/stat/31/85]; [Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339, § 86][/us/act/1900-04-30/ch339/s86], [31 Stat. 158][/us/stat/31/158]; [Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 269, § 1][/us/act/1909-03-03/ch269/s1], [35 Stat. 838][/us/stat/35/838]; [Jan. 7, 1913, ch. 6][/us/act/1913-01-07/ch6], [37 Stat. 648][/us/stat/37/648]; [Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, § 41][/us/act/1917-03-02/ch145/s41], [39 Stat. 965][/us/stat/39/965]; [Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, § 1][/us/act/1921-03-04/ch161/s1], [41 Stat. 1412][/us/stat/41/1412]; [July 9, 1921, ch. 42, § 313][/us/act/1921-07-09/ch42/s313], [42 Stat. 119][/us/stat/42/119]; [Feb. 12, 1925, ch. 220][/us/act/1925-02-12/ch220], [43 Stat. 890][/us/stat/43/890]; [Apr. 17, 1930, ch. 174][/us/act/1930-04-17/ch174], [46 Stat. 170][/us/stat/46/170]; [Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, § 2][/us/act/1938-03-26/ch51/s2], [52 Stat. 118][/us/stat/52/118]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and 643 and 863 of title 48, both U.S.C., 1940 ed., with [section 482 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s482], U.S.C., 1940 ed. It is recommended that said section 315 be amended so as to omit those provisions relating to special attorneys to assist “district attorneys” which were used as part of the basis for this section, as other parts of said section 315, relating to special assistants to the Attorney General, and to foreign counsel, are to remain in title 5.

    Words “United States attorney” were substituted for district attorney, and reference to District of Columbia was omitted. (See reviser’s note under section 501 \[now 541\] of this title.)

    Reference to the territories in said section 482, was also omitted as covered by provisions of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions. See sections 109 and 112 of such title applicable to United States attorney in Alaska, and 1353 applicable in the Canal Zone, and 1405y applicable in the Virgin Islands.

    The provision as to the tenure of the assistant United States attorneys and special attorneys is new. Existing law contains no provision as to tenure or removal of such officials. While the Supreme Court has held that the power of removal of executive officials is incident to the power of appointment, this section expressly provides for removal. See Meyers v. United States, 1926 (47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160).

    Said section 315 contained a provision that special attorneys appointed to assist United States attorneys should take the same oath required of the latter. This section was extended to assistant United States attorneys, respecting whom no provision existed as to oaths.

    A portion of [section 863 of title 48][/us/usc/t48/s863], U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of said section 863, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 501 \[now 541\], and 541 \[see 561\] of this title.

    Other changes were made in phraseology.
