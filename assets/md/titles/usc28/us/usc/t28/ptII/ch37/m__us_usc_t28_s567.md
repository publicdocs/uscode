 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Prior section 551.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 577, 578a (R.S. § 846; [May 28, 1896, ch. 252][/us/act/1896-05-28/ch252], §§ 6, 13, 24, [29 Stat. 179][/us/stat/29/179], 183, 186; [May 27, 1908, ch. 200][/us/act/1908-05-27/ch200], § 1, [35 Stat. 375][/us/stat/35/375]; [June 6, 1930, ch. 409][/us/act/1930-06-06/ch409], [46 Stat. 522][/us/stat/46/522]; [Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431][/us/act/1941-10-13/ch431], § 1, [55 Stat. 736][/us/stat/55/736]).

    Section consolidates first sentence of section 577 with [section 578a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s578a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation. Other provisions of said section 577 are incorporated in [section 1929 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1929].

    The qualification that payments of witness fees or costs be made upon “order of court,” contained in said [section 577 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s577], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as obsolete and suitable reference was made to sections 1825 and 1871 of this title under which payments are now made on certificates of attendance.

    [Section 578a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s578a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., is rewritten in simplified terms without change of substance. The proviso of such section 578a, prohibiting the collection of fees from the United States, was omitted as covered by [section 2412 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2412], providing that the United States should be liable only for fees when such liability is expressly provided by Congress.

    The provision of [section 578a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s578a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that fees and emoluments collected by the marshal shall be deposited by him in accordance with the provisions of [section 495 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s495], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance, was omitted as said section 495 governs such deposits without implementation in this section.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 567, added [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], § 4(c), Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 620][/us/stat/80/620], related to expenses of marshals, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690], § 7608(a)(1). See [section 565 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s565].

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] renumbered [section 572 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s572] as this section.
