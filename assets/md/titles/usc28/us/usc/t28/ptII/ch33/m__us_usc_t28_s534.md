    The sections are combined and reorganized for clarity. Former [section 300 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s300] was from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department of Justice running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under former [section 300 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s300], U.S.C. 1964 ed.

    In subsection (a), the word “shall” is substituted for “has the duty” as a more direct expression. The function of acquiring, collecting, classifying, etc., referred to in former [section 340 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s340] was transferred to the Attorney General by 1950 Reorg., Plan No. 2, § 1, eff. May 24, 1950, [64 Stat. 1261][/us/stat/64/1261], which is codified in [section 509 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s509]. Accordingly, the first 29 words and last 30 words of former section 340 are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (c), the authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied.
