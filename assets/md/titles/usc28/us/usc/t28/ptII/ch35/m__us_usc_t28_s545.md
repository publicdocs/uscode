    In subsection (a), the word “shall” is substituted for “must”. The word “thereof” is substituted for “of the District”.

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Prior section 505.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 524 ([June 20, 1874, ch. 328][/us/act/1874-06-20/ch328], § 2, [18 Stat. 109][/us/stat/18/109]; [May 28, 1896, ch. 252][/us/act/1896-05-28/ch252], §§ 8, 12, [29 Stat. 181][/us/stat/29/181], 183; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 291, [36 Stat. 1167][/us/stat/36/1167]; [June 14, 1941, ch. 203][/us/act/1941-06-14/ch203], §§ 1, 2, [55 Stat. 251][/us/stat/55/251]).

    The provisions of [section 524 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s524], U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States attorney shall give his personal attention to the duties of his office and declaring the office of United States attorney vacant upon his removal from his district or neglect of duty, were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with section 507(b) \[now 519\] of this title, charging the Attorney General with the duty of supervising the United States attorneys in the performance of their duties.

    The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein. Also the residence requirement of this section has no relation to domicile or voting residence nor does it affect the citizenship or residence status of District of Columbia officeholders in the several States from which appointed.

    Only citizens of Hawaii resident therein at least 3 years preceding appointment may be appointed as United States Attorneys for the district of Hawaii. See section 501 \[now 541\] of this title.

    Other provisions of [section 524 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s524], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incorporated in sections 541 \[see 561\] and 751 of this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 545, [act June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 911][/us/stat/62/911], related to vacancies in the office of the United States Marshal, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], § 8(a), and reenactment in [section 565 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s565] by [section 4(c) of Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554/s4/c].
