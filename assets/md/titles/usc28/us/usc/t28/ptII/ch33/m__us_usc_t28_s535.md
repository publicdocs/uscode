    (b)

     Any information, allegation, matter, or complaint witnessed, discovered, or received in a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government relating to violations of Federal criminal law involving Government officers and employees shall be expeditiously reported to the Attorney General by the head of the department or agency, or the witness, discoverer, or recipient, as appropriate, unless—

        (1) the responsibility to perform an investigation with respect thereto is specifically assigned otherwise by another provision of law; or

        (2) as to any department or agency of the Government, the Attorney General directs otherwise with respect to a specified class of information, allegation, or complaint.

    The section is reorganized for clarity and continuity.

    In subsection (a), the word “may” is substituted for “shall have authority”. The word “is” is substituted for “may have been or may hereafter be”.

    In subsection (c), the words “This section does not limit” are substituted for “that the provisions of this section shall not limit, in any way”. The words “(chapter 47 of title 10)” are added after “Uniform Code of Military Justice” to reflect the codification of that Code in title 10, United States Code.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 107–273][/us/pl/107/273] substituted “Federal criminal law” for “title 18” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 107–273][/us/pl/107/273], in introductory provisions, substituted “matter, or complaint witnessed, discovered, or” for “or complaint” and “Federal criminal law” for “title 18” and inserted “or the witness, discoverer, or recipient, as appropriate,” after “agency,”.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    Office of Postmaster General of Post Office Department abolished and all functions, powers, and duties of Postmaster General transferred to United States Postal Service by [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375], § 4(a), Aug. 12, 1970, [84 Stat. 773][/us/stat/84/773], set out as a note under [section 201 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s201], Postal Service.
