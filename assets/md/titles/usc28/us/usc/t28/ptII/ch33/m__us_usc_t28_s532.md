## § 532. Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

    The Attorney General may appoint a Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(Added [Pub. L. 89–554, § 4(c)][/us/pl/89/554/s4/c], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 616][/us/stat/80/616].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    The section is supplied for convenience and clarification and is based on section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, which provided for the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Investigation together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition to a “Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation”. The Division of Investigation was first designated as the “Federal Bureau of Investigation” by the [Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39][/us/act/1935-03-22/ch39], title II, [49 Stat. 77][/us/stat/49/77], and has been so designated in statutes since that date. The title of “Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” was recognized by statute in the [Act of June 5, 1936, ch. 529][/us/act/1936-06-05/ch529], [49 Stat. 1484][/us/stat/49/1484], and has been used in statutes since that date.

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 112–24, § 1][/us/pl/112/24/s1], July 26, 2011, [125 Stat. 238][/us/stat/125/238], provided that: 

> “Congress finds that—

>     “(1) on May 12, 2011, the President requested that Congress extend the term of Robert S. Mueller III as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by 2 years, citing the critical need for continuity and stability at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the face of ongoing threats to the United States and leadership transitions at the Federal agencies charged with protecting national security;

>     “(2) in light of the May 1, 2011, successful operation against Osama bin Laden, the continuing threat to national security, and the approaching 10th anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, the President’s request for a limited, 1-time exception to the term limit of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in these exceptional circumstances, is appropriate; and

>     “(3) this Act \[amending provisions set out as a note under this section\] is intended to provide a 1-time exception to the 10-year statutory limit on the term of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in light of the President’s request and existing exceptional circumstances, and is not intended to create a precedent.”
