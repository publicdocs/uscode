## § 2108. Proof of amount in controversy

    Where the power of any court of appeals to review a case depends upon the amount or value in controversy, such amount or value, if not otherwise satisfactorily disclosed upon the record, may be shown and ascertained by the oath of a party to the case or by other competent evidence.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 963][/us/stat/62/963].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 231 ([Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229][/us/act/1925-02-13/ch229], § 9, [43 Stat. 941][/us/stat/43/941]).

    Words “or in the Supreme Court” were omitted. Section 7 of the 1925 act containing such words related to review by the Supreme Court of the United States of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands and designated a certain jurisdictional amount. Such section 7 has now become obsolete, in view of the recognition of the independence of the Philippines, title 48 U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 1240, Territories and Insular Possessions, and there is no other case wherein the power of the Supreme Court to review depends on the amount or value in controversy.
