## § 1928. Patent infringement action; disclaimer not filed

    Whenever a judgment is rendered for the plaintiff in any patent infringement action involving a part of a patent and it appears that the patentee, in his specifications, claimed to be, but was not, the original and first inventor or discoverer of any material or substantial part of the thing patented, no costs shall be included in such judgment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office prior to the commencement of the action.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 957][/us/stat/62/957]; [Pub. L. 106–113, div. B][/us/pl/106/113/dB], § 1000(a)(9) \[title IV, § 4732(b)(17)\], Nov. 29, 1999, [113 Stat. 1536][/us/stat/113/1536], 1501A–585.)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 821 (R.S. § 973).

    Word “action” was substituted for “any suit at law or in equity” to conform with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Words “or decree” were omitted after “judgment,” because a judgment under Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by definition includes a decree.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1999—[Pub. L. 106–113][/us/pl/106/113] substituted “United States Patent and Trademark Office” for “Patent Office”.

 __Effective Date of 1999 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 106–113][/us/pl/106/113] effective 4 months after Nov. 29, 1999, see section 1000(a)(9) \[title IV, § 4731\] of [Pub. L. 106–113][/us/pl/106/113], set out as a note under [section 1 of Title 35][/us/usc/t35/s1], Patents.
