([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 955][/us/stat/62/955]; [Pub. L. 95–539, § 7][/us/pl/95/539/s7], Oct. 28, 1978, [92 Stat. 2044][/us/stat/92/2044]; [Pub. L. 110–406, § 6][/us/pl/110/406/s6], Oct. 13, 2008, [122 Stat. 4292][/us/stat/122/4292].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 9a(a) and 830 (R.S. § 983; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 5a][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s5a], as added [Jan. 20, 1944, ch. 3, § 1][/us/act/1944-01-20/ch3/s1], [58 Stat. 5][/us/stat/58/5]).

    For distribution of other provisions of [section 9a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s9a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., see table at end of reviser’s notes.

    Word “may” was substituted for “shall” before “tax as costs,” in view of Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, providing for allowance of costs to the prevailing party as of course “unless the court otherwise directs”.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

    Par. (4). [Pub. L. 110–406, § 6(2)][/us/pl/110/406/s6/2], substituted “the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are” for “copies of papers”.

    1978—Par. (6). [Pub. L. 95–539][/us/pl/95/539] added par. (6).
