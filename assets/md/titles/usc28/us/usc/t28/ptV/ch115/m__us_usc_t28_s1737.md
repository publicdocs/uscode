## § 1737. Copy of officer’s bond

    Any person to whose custody the bond of any officer of the United States has been committed shall, on proper request and payment of the fee allowed by any Act of Congress, furnish certified copies thereof, which shall be prima facie evidence in any court of the execution, filing and contents of the bond.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 947][/us/stat/62/947].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 326, 499, 513, and 514 (R.S. §§ 783, 795; [Feb. 22, 1875, ch. 95, § 3][/us/act/1875-02-22/ch95/s3], [18 Stat. 333][/us/stat/18/333]; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 220, 291, [36 Stat. 1152][/us/stat/36/1152], 1167).

    Sections 326, 499, 513, and 514 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. They related to the bonds of particular officers, namely the Clerk of the Supreme Court, the United States marshals, and the clerks of the district courts. The revised section eliminates all inconsistent provisions of such sections.

    The requirement that certified copies be furnished is new.

    The other provisions of sections 326, 499, 513, and 514 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are now incorporated in sections 544 and 952 of this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
