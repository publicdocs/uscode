## § 2043. Deposit of other moneys

    Except for public moneys deposited under [section 2041 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2041], each clerk of the United States courts shall deposit public moneys that the clerk collects into a checking account in the Treasury, subject to disbursement by the clerk. At the end of each accounting period, the earned part of public moneys accruing to the United States shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the appropriate receipt accounts.

    The words “Except for public moneys deposited under [section 2041 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2041] . . . public moneys” are substituted for “All fees and other collections other than moneys referred to in subsection (a) of this section” for consistency and because 31:725v(a) is superseded by 28:2041 and is not part of the revised title contained in section 1 of the bill. The word “Treasury” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (eff. July 31, 1950, [64 Stat. 1280][/us/stat/64/1280]), restated as section 321 of the revised title contained in section 1 of the bill. The text of 31:725v(b)(last sentence) is omitted as obsolete.
