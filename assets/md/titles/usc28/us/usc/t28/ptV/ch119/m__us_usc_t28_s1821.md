    (a)

        (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a witness in attendance at any court of the United States, or before a United States Magistrate Judge, or before any person authorized to take his deposition pursuant to any rule or order of a court of the United States, shall be paid the fees and allowances provided by this section.

        (2) As used in this section, the term “court of the United States” includes, in addition to the courts listed in [section 451 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s451], any court created by Act of Congress in a territory which is invested with any jurisdiction of a district court of the United States.

    (b) A witness shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day for each day’s attendance. A witness shall also be paid the attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of such attendance or at any time during such attendance.

    (c)

        (1) A witness who travels by common carrier shall be paid for the actual expenses of travel on the basis of the means of transportation reasonably utilized and the distance necessarily traveled to and from such witness’s residence by the shortest practical route in going to and returning from the place of attendance. Such a witness shall utilize a common carrier at the most economical rate reasonably available. A receipt or other evidence of actual cost shall be furnished.

        (3) A subsistence allowance for a witness attending in an area designated by the Administrator of General Services as a high-cost area shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum actual subsistence allowance prescribed by the Administrator, pursuant to section 5702(c)(B)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 5, for official travel in such area by employees of the Federal Government.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 600c, [section 1115(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1115/a], U.S.C., 1940, Internal Revenue Code, and section 11–1514 of the D.C. Code, 1940 ed. (R.S. §§ 823, 848; [Apr. 26, 1926, ch. 183][/us/act/1926-04-26/ch183], § 3, [44 Stat. 324][/us/stat/44/324]; [May 17, 1932, ch. 190][/us/act/1932-05-17/ch190], [47 Stat. 158][/us/stat/47/158]; [June 25, 1936, ch. 804][/us/act/1936-06-25/ch804], [49 Stat. 1921][/us/stat/49/1921]; [Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2][/us/act/1939-02-10/ch2], § 1115(a), [53 Stat. 160][/us/stat/53/160]; [Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825][/us/act/1942-12-24/ch825], § 1, [56 Stat. 1088][/us/stat/56/1088].

    Section consolidates part of [section 600c of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s600c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., with [section 1115(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1115/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–1514 of the D.C. Code, 1940 ed.

    Words “or person taking his deposition pursuant to any order of a court of the United States” were added to cover that circumstance.

    Reference in [section 600c of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s600c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–1514 of the D.C. Code, 1940 ed., to the district courts of Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, were omitted as covered by the words “any court of the United States”.

    Provision of [section 600c of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s600c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of witnesses is incorporated in [section 1825 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s1825].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    By Senate amendments, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated. Therefore, as finally enacted, [section 1115(a) of Title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1115/a], U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not one of the sources of this section. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
