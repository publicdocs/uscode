## § 1962. Lien

    Every judgment rendered by a district court within a State shall be a lien on the property located in such State in the same manner, to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in such State, and shall cease to be a lien in the same manner and time. This section does not apply to judgments entered in favor of the United States. Whenever the law of any State requires a judgment of a State court to be registered, recorded, docketed or indexed, or any other act to be done, in a particular manner, or in a certain office or county or parish before such lien attaches, such requirements shall apply only if the law of such State authorizes the judgment of a court of the United States to be registered, recorded, docketed, indexed or otherwise conformed to rules and requirements relating to judgments of the courts of the State.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 958][/us/stat/62/958]; [Pub. L. 101–647, title XXXVI][/us/pl/101/647/tXXXVI], § 3627, Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4965][/us/stat/104/4965].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 812 and 814 (R.S. § 967; [Aug. 1, 1888, ch. 729][/us/act/1888-08-01/ch729], § 1, [25 Stat. 357][/us/stat/25/357]; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 291, [36 Stat. 1167][/us/stat/36/1167]; [Aug. 17, 1912, ch. 300][/us/act/1912-08-17/ch300], [37 Stat. 311][/us/stat/37/311]).

    Section consolidates sections 812 and 814 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation and to clarify the meaning of such sections.

    Omitted words “or decree” after “judgments” as unnecessary inasmuch as Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by definition of judgment includes a decree.

    Words “in the State of Louisiana” after “or parish” were omitted as unnecessary.

    A reference to [section 813 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s813], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted, since such section is omitted from this revision as covered by Rule 79(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

 __Amendments__ 

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647] inserted after first sentence “This section does not apply to judgments entered in favor of the United States.”

 __Effective Date of 1990 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647] effective 180 days after Nov. 29, 1990, see [section 3631 of Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647/s3631], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 3001 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s3001].
