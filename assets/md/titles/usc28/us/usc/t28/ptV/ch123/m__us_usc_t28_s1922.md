## § 1922. Witness fees before United States magistrate judges

    The fees of more than four witnesses shall not be taxed against the United States, in the examination of any criminal case before a United States magistrate judge, unless their materiality and importance are first approved and certified to by the United States attorney for the district in which the examination is had.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 956][/us/stat/62/956]; [Pub. L. 90–578, title IV, § 402(b)(2)][/us/pl/90/578/s402/b/2], Oct. 17, 1968, [82 Stat. 1118][/us/stat/82/1118]; [Pub. L. 101–650, title III, § 321][/us/pl/101/650/s321], Dec. 1, 1990, [104 Stat. 5117][/us/stat/104/5117].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 828 (R.S. § 981; [May 28, 1896, ch. 252, § 19][/us/act/1896-05-28/ch252/s19], [29 Stat. 184][/us/stat/29/184]).

    Last clause of [section 828 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s828], U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing “and such taxation shall be subject to revision, as in other cases” was omitted as unnecessary in view of the inherent power of the court to revise costs taxed.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Change of Name__ 

    “United States magistrate judges” substituted for “United States magistrates” in section catchline and “United States magistrate judge” substituted for “United States magistrate” in text pursuant to [section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650][/us/pl/101/650/s321], set out as a note under [section 631 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s631]. Previously, “United States magistrates” and “United States magistrate” substituted for “United States commissioners” and “United States commissioner”, respectively, pursuant to [Pub. L. 90–578][/us/pl/90/578]. See chapter 43 (§ 631 et seq.) of this title.
