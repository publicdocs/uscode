([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 951][/us/stat/62/951]; [Pub. L. 89–162][/us/pl/89/162], Sept. 2, 1965, [79 Stat. 618][/us/stat/79/618]; [Pub. L. 99–651, title I, § 104][/us/pl/99/651/s104], Nov. 14, 1986, [100 Stat. 3645][/us/stat/100/3645]; [Pub. L. 101–650, title III, § 321][/us/pl/101/650/s321], Dec. 1, 1990, [104 Stat. 5117][/us/stat/104/5117].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 600c, 608 (R.S. §§ 236, 823, 848, 855; [June 10, 1921, ch. 18, § 305][/us/act/1921-06-10/ch18/s305], [42 Stat. 24][/us/stat/42/24]; [Apr. 26, 1926, ch. 183, § 3][/us/act/1926-04-26/ch183/s3], [44 Stat. 324][/us/stat/44/324]; [May 17, 1932, ch. 190][/us/act/1932-05-17/ch190], [47 Stat. 158][/us/stat/47/158]; [June 25, 1936, ch. 804][/us/act/1936-06-25/ch804], [49 Stat. 1921][/us/stat/49/1921]; [Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, § 2][/us/act/1941-10-13/ch431/s2], [55 Stat. 736][/us/stat/55/736]; [Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, § 1][/us/act/1942-12-24/ch825/s1], [56 Stat. 1088][/us/stat/56/1088]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 600c and 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to payment of witnesses. Other provisions of such sections are incorporated in sections 1821 and 1871 of this title.

    Provisions in sections 600c and 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment or certification on order of court were omitted as unnecessary and inappropriate on recommendation of the Judicial Conference Committee on Revision of the Judicial Code.

    Words in [section 608 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s608], U.S.C., 1940 ed., “to which they appear to be entitled on the certificate of attendance” following the words “all fees” and the concluding phrase “which sum shall be allowed the marshal in the General Accounting Office in his accounts were omitted as unnecessary.”

    The second paragraph is new. It conforms to Rule 45(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but is inconsistent with Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and supersedes that rule as to Federal criminal cases. The Department of Justice suggests that Rule 17(d) is unworkable. To attempt compliance each deputy marshal serving process must carry, on the average, $500 in cash on trips to serve process.

    The marshal must advance the money from his personal funds. The Comptroller General has not been able to set up any procedure to make it feasible to advance fees to Government witnesses.

    If a witness is served but fails or refuses to appear, the marshal is out of pocket the money advanced and has no recourse. In the exceptional cases of real necessity, the marshal supplies transportation to an indigent witness under established regulations which protect the disbursement.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–651][/us/pl/99/651] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows:

    “In any case wherein the United States or an officer or agency thereof, is a party, the United States marshal for the district shall pay all fees of witnesses on the certificate of the United States Attorney or Assistant United States Attorney, and in the proceedings before a United States Commissioner, on the certificate of such commissioner.

    “In all proceedings, in forma pauperis, for a writ of habeas corpus or in proceedings under [section 2255 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2255], the United States marshal for the district shall pay all fees of witnesses for the party authorized to proceed in forma pauperis, on the certificate of the district judge.

    “Fees and mileage need not be tendered to the witness upon service of a subpena issued in behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, or upon service of a subpena issued on behalf of a party, authorized to proceed in forma pauperis, where the payment thereof is to be made by the United States marshal as authorized in this section.”

    1965—[Pub. L. 89–162][/us/pl/89/162] inserted provisions that, in all proceedings in forma pauperis, for a writ of habeas corpus, or in proceedings under [section 2255 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s2255], the United States marshal for the district shall pay all fees of witnesses for the party authorized to proceed in forma pauperis on the certificate of the district judge and that fees and mileage need not be tendered to the witness upon service of a subpena issued on behalf of a party authorized to proceed in forma pauperis where the payment thereof is to be made by the United States marshal as authorized in this section.

 __Change of Name__ 

    “United States magistrate judge” and “magistrate judge” substituted for “United States magistrate” and “magistrate”, respectively, in subsec. (a) pursuant to [section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650][/us/pl/101/650/s321], set out as a note under this title.

 __Effective Date of 1986 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 99–651][/us/pl/99/651] effective 120 days after Nov. 14, 1986, see [section 105 of Pub. L. 99–651][/us/pl/99/651/s105], set out as a note under [section 3006A of Title 18][/us/usc/t18/s3006A], Crimes and Criminal Procedure.
