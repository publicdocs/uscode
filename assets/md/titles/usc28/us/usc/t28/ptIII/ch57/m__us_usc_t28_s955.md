## § 955. Practice of law restricted

    The clerk of each court and his deputies and assistants shall not practice law in any court of the United States.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 926][/us/stat/62/926].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 395 and 396 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 273, 274, [36 Stat. 1164][/us/stat/36/1164]).

    Section consolidates parts of sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remainder, relating to United States marshals and their deputies, is incorporated in [section 556 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s556].

    Sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., have been extended to include all clerks, deputies, and assistants.

    The revised section substitutes as simpler and more appropriate, the prohibition against practice of law “in any court of the United States.” (See reviser’s note under [section 556 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s556].)

    For explanation of provisions omitted from sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., also see reviser’s note under [section 556 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s556].

    Changes in phraseology were made.
