## § 794. Law clerks and secretaries

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 924][/us/stat/62/924]; [Pub. L. 97–164, title I][/us/pl/97/164/tI], § 121(c)(1), Apr. 2, 1982, [96 Stat. 34][/us/stat/96/34]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 270 ([Feb. 24, 1925, ch. 301][/us/act/1925-02-24/ch301], § 2, [43 Stat. 965][/us/stat/43/965]; [May 29, 1928, ch. 852][/us/act/1928-05-29/ch852], § 711, [45 Stat. 882][/us/stat/45/882]; [June 23, 1930, ch. 573][/us/act/1930-06-23/ch573], § 1, [46 Stat. 799][/us/stat/46/799]; [Oct. 16, 1941, ch. 443][/us/act/1941-10-16/ch443], [55 Stat. 741][/us/stat/55/741]).

    The first sentence of the revised section makes express provision for appointment of stenographers and necessary clerical employees.

    Other provisions of [section 270 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s270], U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 456 and 792 of this title.

    Specific provision for $5 per diem for stenographers is omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with [section 962 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s962]. Travel and subsistence allowances of Government employees are governed by sections 822–833 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.
