 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 445 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], § 303, as added [Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501][/us/act/1939-08-07/ch501], § 1, [53 Stat. 1223][/us/stat/53/1223]).

    This section contains provisions in [section 445 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s445], U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of employees.

    Words “with the approval of the Supreme Court” were omitted to relieve the court of the burden of approving appointments which in practice should properly be made by the Director under the supervision of the Judicial Conference of the United States.

    The remainder of [section 445 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s445], U.S.C., 1940 ed., is incorporated in sections 603 and 607 of this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
