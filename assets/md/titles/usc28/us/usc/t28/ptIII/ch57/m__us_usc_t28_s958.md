## § 958. Persons ineligible as receivers

    A person holding any civil or military office or employment under the United States or employed by any justice or judge of the United States shall not at the same time be appointed a receiver in any case in any court of the United States.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 926][/us/stat/62/926].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 527 ([May 28, 1896, ch. 252, § 20][/us/act/1896-05-28/ch252/s20], [29 Stat. 184][/us/stat/29/184]; [Dec. 28, 1945, ch. 592][/us/act/1945-12-28/ch592], [59 Stat. 659][/us/stat/59/659]).

    Provisions of [section 527 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s527], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to ineligibility of various persons as United States commissioner appear as [section 631 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s631]. Words “janitor of any Government building” were omitted as covered by words “person holding any civil or military employment under the United States” used in the revised section.

    The general language of the revised section was substituted for the provisions of [section 527 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s527], U.S.C., 1940 ed., enumerating certain officers and employees.

    The exception of Alaska by reference to “[section 591 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s591]” in [section 527 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s527], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as surplusage. Alaska is excluded by reason of the words “any court of the United States” which are limited by definitive [section 451 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s451].

    Changes in phraseology were made.
