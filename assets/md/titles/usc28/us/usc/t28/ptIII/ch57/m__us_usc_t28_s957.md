([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 926][/us/stat/62/926]; [Pub. L. 95–598, title II][/us/pl/95/598/tII], § 234, Nov. 6, 1978, [92 Stat. 2667][/us/stat/92/2667]; [Pub. L. 97–164, title I][/us/pl/97/164/tI], § 122(b), Apr. 2, 1982, [96 Stat. 36][/us/stat/96/36]; [Pub. L. 98–353, title I][/us/pl/98/353/tI], § 109, July 10, 1984, [98 Stat. 342][/us/stat/98/342].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 127, 304 ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231], §§ 68, 191, [36 Stat. 1105][/us/stat/36/1105], 1144).

    Section consolidates section 127 with part of 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Provisions of [section 304 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s304], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment, powers, duties, and compensation of the clerk of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and table of fees are incorporated in sections 604, 831, 956 and 1926 of this title.

    Appointment and compensation of masters for district courts, see Rule 53(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    The words “commissioner” and “referee” did not appear in [section 127 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s127], U.S.C., 1940 ed. They were added to subsection (a) to remove possible ambiguity.

    Words “by the court or any judge thereof” in [section 304 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s304], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage.

    Words “or assistant clerks” and “in any case” were added in subsection (b) to make the section applicable to that officer and consistent with the prohibition in this section against deputies of district court clerks.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] struck out “district” before “court”.

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–164][/us/pl/97/164] struck out designation “(a)” before “A clerk of a district court” and struck out subsec. (b) which had provided that the clerk or assistant clerk of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals could not be appointed a commissioner, master, or referee in any case.

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598] directed the amendment of section by inserting “or bankruptcy court” after “district court”, which amendment did not become effective pursuant to [section 402(b) of Pub. L. 95–598][/us/pl/95/598/s402/b], as amended, set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 11][/us/usc/t11/s101], Bankruptcy.

 __Effective Date of 1984 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353] effective July 10, 1984, see [section 122(a) of Pub. L. 98–353][/us/pl/98/353/s122/a], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 151 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s151].

 __Effective Date of 1982 Amendment__
