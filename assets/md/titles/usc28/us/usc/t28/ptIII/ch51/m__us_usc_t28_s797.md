## § 797. Recall of retired judges

    (a)

        (1) Any judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims who has retired from regular active service under subchapter III of chapter 83, or chapter 84, of title 5 shall be known and designated as a senior judge and may perform duties as a judge when recalled pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

        (2) Any judge of the Court of Federal Claims receiving an annuity under [section 178(c) of this title][/us/usc/t28/s178/c] (pertaining to disability) who, in the estimation of the chief judge, has recovered sufficiently to render judicial service, shall be known and designated as a senior judge and may perform duties as a judge when recalled under subsection (b) of this section.

    (b) The chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims may, whenever he deems it advisable, recall any senior judge, with such judge’s consent, to perform such duties as a judge and for such period of time as the chief judge may specify.

    (c) Any senior judge performing duties pursuant to this section shall not be counted as a judge for purposes of the number of judgeships authorized by [section 171 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s171].

    (d) Any senior judge, while performing duties pursuant to this section, shall be paid the same allowances for travel and other expenses as a judge in active service. Such senior judge shall also receive from the Court of Federal Claims supplemental pay in an amount sufficient, when added to his retirement annuity, to equal the salary of a judge in active service for the same period or periods of time. Such supplemental pay shall be paid in the same manner as the salary of a judge.
