## § 712. Law clerks and secretaries

    Circuit judges may appoint necessary law clerks and secretaries. A law clerk appointed under this section shall be exempt from the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, unless specifically included by the appointing judge or by local rule of court.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 646][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch646], [62 Stat. 920][/us/stat/62/920]; [Pub. L. 100–702, title X, § 1003(a)(3)][/us/pl/100/702/s1003/a/3], Nov. 19, 1988, [102 Stat. 4665][/us/stat/102/4665].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 222a ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 118a][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s118a], as added [June 17, 1930, ch. 509][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch509], [46 Stat. 774][/us/stat/46/774]).

    Provision of [section 222a of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s222a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to compensation of law clerks is incorporated in [section 604 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s604]. (See reviser’s note under such section.)

    Words “with the approval of the Attorney General,” were omitted to confer on circuit judges the same authority given Supreme Court justices under [section 675 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s675].

    The provision for appointment of secretaries is new. Existing law fixes compensation of secretaries but makes no provision for their appointment. (See [section 604 of this title][/us/usc/t28/s604] and reviser’s note thereunder.)

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–702][/us/pl/100/702] inserted at end “A law clerk appointed under this section shall be exempt from the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, unless specifically included by the appointing judge or by local rule of court.”
