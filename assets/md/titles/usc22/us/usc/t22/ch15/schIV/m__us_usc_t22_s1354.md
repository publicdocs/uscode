## § 1354. Quotas on Philippine articles

    (a) __to (c) Omitted__ 

    (d) __Investigations by International Trade Commission__ 

        The United States International Trade Commission shall at the request of the President, upon resolution of either House of Congress or concurrent resolution of both Houses of Congress, upon its own motion, or when in its judgment there is good reason therefor, upon application of any interested party, make an investigation to ascertain (1) whether imports of a Philippine article (other than an article for which a quota is established by part 2 of subchapter I) are coming, or are likely to come, into substantial competition with like articles which are the product of the United States; (2) what is the greatest amount of such article which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, in the United States for consumption, without coming into substantial competition with like articles which are the product of the United States; and (3) the total amount of such article which (during the twelve months ended on the last day of the month preceding the month in which occurs the date of the beginning of the investigation) was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, in the United States for consumption. During the course of the investigation the Commission shall hold a public hearing, of which reasonable public notice shall be given and at which parties interested shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard. The Commission shall give precedence to such investigations. The Commission shall report the results of its investigations to the President, and shall send copies of such report to each House of the Congress.
