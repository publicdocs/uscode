## § 1355. Suspension of processing tax on coconut oil

    Whenever the President, after consultation with the President of the Philippines, finds that adequate supplies of neither copra nor coconut oil, the product of the Philippines, are readily available for processing in the United States, he shall so proclaim, and after the date of such proclamation the provisions of section 2470(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be suspended until the expiration of 30 days after he proclaims that, after consultation with the President of the Philippines, he has found that such adequate supplies are so readily available.

([Apr. 30, 1946, ch. 244][/us/act/1946-04-30/ch244], title V, § 505(b), [60 Stat. 157][/us/stat/60/157].)

 __Suspension of Provisions__ 

    Section not applicable during such time as the revised agreement between the United States and the Philippines is in effect, see [section 1373 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1373].

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 2470(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, referred to in text, is a reference to section 2470(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Section 2470 was repealed by section 7851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Title 26, and was reenacted as sections 4511 and 4513 of Title 26. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was redesignated the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095]. Sections 4511 and 4513 of Title 26 were repealed by [Pub. L. 87–456, title III, § 302(d)][/us/pl/87/456/s302/d], May 24, 1962, [76 Stat. 77][/us/stat/76/77], effective Aug. 31, 1963.

 __Termination of Suspension of Additional Rate on Coconut Oil__ 

    By Proc. No. 2847, July 28, 1949, 14 F.R. 4773, [63 Stat. 1279][/us/stat/63/1279], the President found that “adequate supplies of copra and coconut oil, the product of the Philippines, are readily available for processing in the United States” and that upon the expiration of 30 days from July 28, 1949, the suspension of the provisions of section 2470(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 will be terminated.

 __Suspension Proclamation__ 

    By Proc. No. 2693, June 28, 1946, 11 F.R. 7255, [60 Stat. 1349][/us/stat/60/1349], the President found that “adequate supplies of neither copra nor coconut oil, the product of the Philippines, are readily available for processing in the United States,” and therefore the provisions of section 2470(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 are suspended.
