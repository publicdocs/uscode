## § 461. Enforcement by courts; employment of land or naval forces

    The district courts shall take cognizance of all complaints, by whomsoever instituted, in cases of captures made within the waters of the United States, or within a marine league of the coasts or shores thereof. In every case in which a vessel is fitted out and armed, or attempted to be fitted out and armed, or in which the force of any vessel of war, cruiser, or other armed vessel is increased or augmented, or in which any military expedition or enterprise is begun or set on foot, contrary to the provisions and prohibitions of this subchapter and sections 958 to 962 of title 18; and in every case of the capture of a vessel within the jurisdiction or protection of the United States as before defined; and in every case in which any process issuing out of any court of the United States is disobeyed or resisted by any person having the custody of any vessel of war, cruiser, or other armed vessel of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people, or of any subjects or citizens of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people, it shall be lawful for the President or such other person as he shall have empowered for that purpose, to employ such part of the land or naval forces of the United States, or of the militia thereof, for the purpose of taking possession of and detaining any such vessel, with her prizes, if any, in order to enforce the execution of the prohibitions and penalties of this subchapter and sections 958 to 962 of title 18, and the restoring of such prizes in the cases in which restoration shall be adjudged; and also for the purpose of preventing the carrying on of any such expedition or enterprise from the territory or jurisdiction of the United States against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United States are at peace.

([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 14, [35 Stat. 1090][/us/stat/35/1090].)

 __Codification__ 

    This subchapter and sections 958 to 962 of title 18, referred to in text, was in the original “this chapter”, meaning chapter 2 of the act of Mar. 4, 1909, which had been classified to sections 461 to 464 of this title and sections 21 to 25, and 30 of former Title 18, Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure.

    “This subchapter” substituted in text for “sections 461 to 464 of this title”.

    “Sections 958 to 962 of title 18” substituted in text for “sections 21 to 25, and 30 of title 18” on authority of [act June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 683][/us/stat/62/683], section 1 of which enacted Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 26 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s26] prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 18 by [act June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], § 1, [62 Stat. 683][/us/stat/62/683].

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    Section was derived from R.S. § 5287 ([act Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 88][/us/act/1818-04-20/ch88], § 8, [3 Stat. 449][/us/stat/3/449]) which was amended by [act Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80][/us/act/1875-02-18/ch80], [18 Stat. 320][/us/stat/18/320], and was repealed by [section 341 of the act of Mar. 4, 1909][/us/act/1909-03-04/s341].
