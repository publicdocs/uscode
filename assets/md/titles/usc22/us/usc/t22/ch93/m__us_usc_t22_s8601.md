## § 8601. Findings

    Congress makes the following findings:

    (1) Since 1948, United States Presidents and both houses of Congress, on a bipartisan basis and supported by the American people, have repeatedly reaffirmed the special bond between the United States and Israel, based on shared values and shared interests.

    (2) The Middle East is undergoing rapid change, bringing with it hope for an expansion of democracy but also great challenges to the national security of the United States and our allies in the region, particularly to our most important ally in the region, Israel.

    (3) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing its decades-long pattern of seeking to foment instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, particularly in this time of dramatic political transition.

    (4) At the same time, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.

    (5) A nuclear-weapons capable Iran would fundamentally threaten vital United States interests, encourage regional nuclear proliferation, further empower Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, and pose a serious and destabilizing threat to Israel and the region.

    (6) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, Hizbollah and Hamas have increased their stockpile of rockets, with more than 60,000 now ready to be fired at Israel. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to add to its arsenal of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran’s neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region.

    (7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered strategic environment.

    (8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 ([Public Law 108–11][/us/pl/108/11]; [117 Stat. 576][/us/stat/117/576]), the authority to make available loan guarantees to Israel is currently set to expire on September 30, 2012.

([Pub. L. 112–150][/us/pl/112/150], § 2, July 27, 2012, [126 Stat. 1146][/us/stat/126/1146].)

 __Short Title of 2014 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 113–296][/us/pl/113/296], § 1, Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 4075][/us/stat/128/4075], provided that: 

> “This Act \[enacting [section 8606 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s8606], amending sections 2321h and 2776 of this title and [section 17337 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s17337], The Public Health and Welfare, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 8602, 8603, and 8606 of this title, and amending provisions set out as a note under [section 2776 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2776]\] may be cited as the ‘United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014’.”

 __Short Title__ 

[Pub. L. 112–150][/us/pl/112/150], § 1, July 27, 2012, [126 Stat. 1146][/us/stat/126/1146], provided that: 

> “This Act \[enacting this chapter and amending [section 2321h of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2321h]\] may be cited as the ‘United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012’.”

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 113–296][/us/pl/113/296], § 2, Dec. 19, 2014, [128 Stat. 4075][/us/stat/128/4075], provided that: 

> “Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) The people and the Governments of the United States and of Israel share a deep and unbreakable bond, forged by over 60 years of shared interests and shared values.

>     “(2) Today, the people and Governments of the United States and of Israel are facing a dynamic and rapidly changing security environment in the Middle East and North Africa, necessitating deeper cooperation on a range of defense, security, and intelligence matters.

>     “(3) From Gaza, Hamas continues to deny Israel’s right to exist and persists in firing rockets indiscriminately at population centers in Israel.

>     “(4) Hezbollah—with support from Iran—continues to stockpile rockets and may be seeking to exploit the tragic and volatile security situation within Syria.

>     “(5) The Government of Iran continues to pose a grave threat to the region and the world at large with its reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons.

>     “(6) Given these challenges, it is imperative that the United States continues to deepen cooperation with allies like Israel in pursuit of shared policy objectives.”
