## § 7112. Additional activities to monitor and combat forced labor and child labor

    (a) __Activities of the Department of State__ 

        (1) __Finding__ 

            Congress finds that in the report submitted to Congress by the Secretary of State in June 2005 pursuant to [section 7107(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7107/b], the list of countries whose governments do not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and are not making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance was composed of a large number of countries in which the trafficking involved forced labor, including the trafficking of women into domestic servitude.

        (2) __Sense of Congress__ 

            It is the sense of Congress that the Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the Department of State should intensify the focus of the Office on forced labor in the countries described in paragraph (1) and other countries in which forced labor continues to be a serious human rights concern.

        (3) __Information sharing__ 

            The Secretary of State shall, on a regular basis, provide information relating to child labor and forced labor in the production of goods in violation of international standards to the Department of Labor to be used in developing the list described in subsection (b)(2)(C).

    (b) __Activities of the Department of Labor__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary of Labor, acting through the head of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs of the Department of Labor, shall carry out additional activities to monitor and combat forced labor and child labor in foreign countries as described in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Additional activities described__ 

        The additional activities referred to in paragraph (1) are—

            (A) to monitor the use of forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards;

            (B) to provide information regarding trafficking in persons for the purpose of forced labor to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the Department of State for inclusion in trafficking in persons report required by [section 7107(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7107/b];

            (C) to develop and make available to the public a list of goods from countries that the Bureau of International Labor Affairs has reason to believe are produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards;

            (D) to work with persons who are involved in the production of goods on the list described in subparagraph (C) to create a standard set of practices that will reduce the likelihood that such persons will produce goods using the labor described in such subparagraph; and

            (E) to consult with other departments and agencies of the United States Government to reduce forced and child labor internationally and ensure that products made by forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards are not imported into the United States.

        (3) __Submission to Congress__ 

            Not later than December 1, 2014, and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary of Labor shall submit the list developed under paragraph (2)(C) to Congress.
