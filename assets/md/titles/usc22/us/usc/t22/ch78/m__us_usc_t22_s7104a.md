        (1) the recipient has implemented a plan to prevent the activities described in [section 7104(g) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7104/g], as amended by section 1702, and is in compliance with that plan;

    (b) __Limitation__ 

        Any plan or procedures implemented pursuant to subsection (a) shall be appropriate to the size and complexity of the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement and to the nature and scope of its activities, including the number of non-United States citizens expected to be employed.

    (c) __Disclosure__ 

        The recipient shall provide a copy of the plan to the contracting or grant officer upon request, and as appropriate, shall post the useful and relevant contents of the plan or related materials on its website and at the workplace.
