        The President shall, after January 2, 2013—

            The requirement to impose sanctions under paragraph (1)(A) shall not include the authority to impose sanctions on the importation of goods.

        (3) __Application of certain provisions__ 

            Sections 8514(d) and 8551(b) of this title shall apply with respect to sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) to the same extent that such sections apply with respect to the imposition of sanctions under [section 8514(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s8514/a].
