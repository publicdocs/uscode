        (2) fully and publicly support efforts made by the people of Iran to promote the establishment of basic freedoms that build the foundation for the emergence of a freely elected, open, and democratic political system;

        (3) help the people of Iran produce, access, and share information freely and safely via the Internet and through other media; and

        (4) defeat all attempts by the Government of Iran to jam or otherwise obstruct international satellite broadcast signals.
