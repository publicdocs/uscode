## § 4211. Returns as to fees by officers compensated by fees

    All consular agents, as are allowed for their compensation the whole or any part of the fees which they may collect, shall make returns in such manner as the Government Accountability Office shall prescribe, of all such fees as they or any person in their behalf so collect.

(R.S. § 1725; [July 31, 1894, ch. 174, § 5][/us/act/1894-07-31/ch174/s5], [28 Stat. 206][/us/stat/28/206]; [Apr. 5, 1906, ch. 1366, § 3][/us/act/1906-04-05/ch1366/s3], [34 Stat. 100][/us/stat/34/100]; [June 10, 1921, ch. 18][/us/act/1921-06-10/ch18], title III, § 304, [42 Stat. 24][/us/stat/42/24]; [Pub.

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 1725 derived from [act Aug. 18, 1856, ch. 127, § 18][/us/act/1856-08-18/ch127/s18], [11 Stat. 58][/us/stat/11/58].

    References to “commercial agents” and “vice-commercial agents” were omitted in view of the abolition of the grade of commercial agent by act Apr. 5, 1906.

    Section was not enacted as part of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 which comprises this chapter.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 1191 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1191], and prior thereto to [section 94 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s94].

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    “Government Accountability Office” substituted in text for “General Accounting Office” pursuant to [section 8(b) of Pub. L. 108–271][/us/pl/108/271/s8/b], set out as a note under [section 702 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s702], Money and Finance, which redesignated the General Accounting Office and any references thereto as the Government Accountability Office. Previously, “General Accounting Office” substituted in text for “Comptroller of the Treasury” pursuant to act June 10, 1921, which transferred all powers and duties conferred upon Comptroller, six auditors, and certain other officers of the Treasury to General Accounting Office. See section 701 et seq. of Title 31. Previously, functions of Secretary of State under this section transferred to Comptroller of the Treasury by act July 31, 1894.
