## § 4171. Model foreign language competence posts

    (a) __Designation of posts; time of designation and implementation; determination of competency standards__ 

        In order to carry out the purposes of [section 4022 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4022] and to help ascertain the relationship between foreign language competence and the effectiveness of representation of the United States abroad, the Secretary of State shall designate as model foreign language competence posts at least two Foreign Service posts in countries where English is not the common language. Such designation shall be made no later than October 1, 1981, and shall be implemented so that no later than October 1, 1983, each Government employee permanently assigned to those posts shall possess an appropriate level of competence in the language common to the country where the post is located. The Secretary of State shall determine appropriate levels of language competence for employees assigned to those posts by reference to the nature of their functions and the standards employed by the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center.

    (b) __Continuation; report to Congress concerning operation of posts and advantages of meeting competency requirements__ 

        The posts designated under subsection (a) of this section shall continue as model foreign language competence posts at least until September 30, 1985. The Secretary of State shall submit no later than January 31, 1986, a report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate describing the operation of such posts and the costs, advantages and disadvantages associated with meeting the foreign language competence requirements of this section.

    (c) __Exceptions; report to Congress__ 

        The Secretary of State may authorize exceptions to the requirements of this section if he determines that unanticipated exigencies so require.
