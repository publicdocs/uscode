## § 4086. Entitlement to vote in a State in a Federal election; preconditions; applicability

    (a)

     Except as provided in subsection (b) and in such manner as shall be otherwise authorized by a State or other jurisdiction within the territory of the United States, a member of the Service residing outside the United States shall, in addition to any entitlement to vote in a State in a Federal election under section 3 of the Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act ([42 U.S.C. 1973dd–1][/us/usc/t42/s1973dd–1]), be entitled to vote in a Federal election in the State in which such member was last domiciled immediately before entering the Service if such member—

        (1) makes an election of that State;

        (2) notifies that State of such election and notifies any other States in which he or she is entitled to vote of such election; and

        (3) otherwise meets the requirements of such Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1973dd][/us/usc/t42/s1973dd] et seq.\].

    (b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply only to an individual who becomes a member of the Service on or after November 22, 1983, and shall not apply to an individual who registers to vote in a State in which he is entitled to vote under section 3 of Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1973dd–1][/us/usc/t42/s1973dd–1]\].

([Pub. L. 96–465, title I][/us/pl/96/465/tI], § 906, as added [Pub. L. 98–164, title I][/us/pl/98/164/tI], § 129(a), Nov. 22, 1983, [97 Stat. 1027][/us/stat/97/1027].)

 __References in Text__

L. 94–203][/us/pl/94/203], Jan. 2, 1976, [89 Stat. 1142][/us/stat/89/1142], which was classified generally to subchapter I–E (§ 1973dd et seq.) of chapter 20 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, and which was repealed by [Pub. L. 99–410, title II][/us/pl/99/410/tII], § 203, Aug. 28, 1986, [100 Stat. 930][/us/stat/100/930].
