 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–415][/us/pl/103/415] substituted “United States citizens hired abroad” for “Employment of family members of Government employees” as section catchline and inserted “by reason of such employment” after “eligible” in subsec. (d).

    [Pub. L. 103–236][/us/pl/103/236] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows:

    “(a) The Secretary, when employing individuals abroad in positions to which career members of the Service are not customarily assigned (including, when continuity over a long term is not a significant consideration, vacant positions normally filled by foreign national employees), shall give equal consideration to employing available qualified family members of members of the Service or of other Government employees assigned abroad. Family members so employed shall serve under renewable limited appointments in the Service and may be paid either in accordance with the Foreign Service Schedule or a local compensation plan established under [section 3968 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s3968].

    “(b) Employment of family members in accordance with this section may not be used to avoid fulfilling the need for full-time career positions.”
