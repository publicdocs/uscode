## § 4049. Death in service

    (a) __Lump-sum credit__ 

        If a participant dies and no claim for annuity is payable under this part, the lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with [section 4055 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4055].

    (b) __Surviving spouse__ 

        If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or former spouse qualifying for an annuity under [section 4054(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4054/b], such surviving spouse shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with subsections (e) and (g) of this section and [section 4046(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046/a] and any surviving former spouse shall be entitled to an annuity under [section 4054(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4054/b] as if the participant died after being entitled to an annuity under this part. If the participant had less than 3 years creditable civilian service at the time of death, the survivor annuity shall be computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service.

    (c) __Surviving spouse or former spouse, and children__ 

        If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, and a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(1) and (d) of [section 4046 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046].

    (d) __Surviving children__ 

        If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is not survived by a spouse, or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(2) and (d) of [section 4046 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046].

    (e) __Service credit; presumption of qualification__ 

        If, at the time of his or her death, the participant had less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System, the annuity payable in accordance with subsection (b) of this section shall be computed in accordance with [section 4046 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046] on the assumption he or she has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a deceased participant under this subsection shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age on the date of death and age 60. In all cases arising under this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (d), or (g) of this section, it shall be assumed that the deceased participant was qualified for retirement on the date of death.

    (f) __Recall service__ 

        If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity dies in service after being recalled under [section 3948 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s3948] and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with [section 4063 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4063]. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under [section 4046(i) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046/i] as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his or her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under this subchapter, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under subsection (b) of this section on the basis of the total service of the annuitant.

    (g) __Limitation on surviving spouse’s annuity__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, if the participant or former participant had a former spouse qualifying for an annuity under [section 4054(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4054/b], the annuity of the spouse under this section shall be subject to the limitation of [section 4046(b)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046/b/3/B].

    (h) __Commencement, termination, and resumption of annuities__ 

        Annuities that become payable under this section shall commence, terminate, and be resumed in accordance with subsection (b)(4), (e), or (h) of [section 4046 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s4046], as appropriate.
