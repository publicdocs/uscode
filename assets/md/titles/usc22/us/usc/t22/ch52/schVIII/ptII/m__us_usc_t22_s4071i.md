## § 4071i. Transition provisions

    The Secretary of State shall issue regulations providing for the transition from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System to the Foreign Service Pension System in a manner comparable to the transition of employees subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 (the Civil Service Retirement System) to the Federal Employees’ Retirement System. For this and related purposes, references made to participation in subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 (the Civil Service Retirement System), the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t42/s301] et seq.\], and title 26 shall be deemed to refer to participation in the Foreign Service Pension System or the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System, as appropriate.

([Pub. L. 96–465, title I, § 860][/us/pl/96/465/s860], as added [Pub. L. 99–335, title IV, § 415][/us/pl/99/335/s415], June 6, 1986, [100 Stat. 619][/us/stat/100/619]; amended [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Social Security Act, referred to in text, is [act Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531][/us/act/1935-08-14/ch531], [49 Stat. 620][/us/stat/49/620], as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 7 (§ 301 et seq.) of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see [section 1305 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1305] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
