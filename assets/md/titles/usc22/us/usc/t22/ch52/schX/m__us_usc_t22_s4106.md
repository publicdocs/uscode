The Board shall be composed of 3 members, 1 of whom shall be the Chairman of the Authority, who shall be the Chairperson of the Board. The remaining 2 members shall be appointed by the Chairperson of the Board from nominees approved in writing by the agencies to which this subchapter applies, and the exclusive representative (if any) of employees in each such agency.

Of the 2 original members of the Board other than the Chairperson, one shall be appointed for a 2-year term and one shall be appointed for a 3-year term. Thereafter, each member of the Board other than the Chairperson shall be appointed for a term of 3 years, except that an individual appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the end of a term shall be appointed for the unexpired term of the member replaced. The Chairperson may at any time designate an alternate Chairperson from among the members of the Authority.
