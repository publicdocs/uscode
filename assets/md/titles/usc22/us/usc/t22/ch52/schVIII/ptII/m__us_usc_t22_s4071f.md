## § 4071f. Government contributions

    (a) Each agency employing any participant shall contribute to the Fund the amount computed in a manner similar to that used under [section 8423(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8423/a] pursuant to determinations of the normal cost percentage for the Foreign Service Pension System by the Secretary of State.

    (b)

        (1) The Secretary of State shall compute the amount of the supplemental liability of the Fund as of the close of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1987. The amount of any such supplemental liability shall be amortized in 30 equal annual installments with interest computed at the rate used in the most recent valuation of the System.

        (2) At the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary of State shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount of the installment computed under this subsection for such year.

        (3) Before closing the accounts for a fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall credit to the Fund, as a Government contribution, out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, the amount under paragraph (2) of this subsection for such year.

    (c)

        (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), for purposes of any period in any year beginning after December 31, 2013, the normal-cost percentage under this section shall be determined and applied as if section 402(b) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 had not been enacted.

        (2) Any contributions under this section in excess of the amounts which (but for paragraph (1)) would otherwise have been payable shall be applied toward reducing the unfunded liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System.

        (3) After the unfunded liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System has been eliminated, as determined by the Secretary of State, Government contributions under this section shall be determined and made disregarding this subsection.
