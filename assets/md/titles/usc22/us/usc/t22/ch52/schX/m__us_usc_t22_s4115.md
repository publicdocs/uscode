        (2) to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment;

        (3) to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish upon request customary and routine services and facilities on an impartial basis to labor organizations having equivalent status;

        (4) to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint or petition, or has given any information, affidavit, or testimony under this subchapter;

        (5) to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization, as required under this subchapter;

        (8) to fail or refuse otherwise to comply with any provision of this subchapter.

    (b) __Labor organizations__ 

    It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization—

        (1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subchapter;

        (2) to cause or attempt to cause the Department to discriminate against any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subchapter;

        (3) to coerce, discipline, fine, or attempt to coerce a member of the labor organization as punishment or reprisal, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the member’s work performance or productivity as an employee or the discharge of the member’s functions as an employee;

        (4) to discriminate against an employee with regard to the terms and conditions of membership in the labor organization on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age preferential or nonpreferential civil service status, political affiliation, marital status, or handicapping condition;

            (A) to call, or participate in, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, or to picket the Department in a labor-management dispute (except that any such picketing in the United States which does not interfere with the Department’s operations shall not be an unfair labor practice); or

            (B) to condone any unfair labor practice described in subparagraph (A) by failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity;

        (8)

         to deny membership to any employee in the unit represented by the labor organization except—

        (2) corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person; or

        (3) informs employees of the Government’s policy relating to labor-management relations and representation,

        if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit and was not made under coercive conditions shall not—

        (A) constitute an unfair labor practice under this subchapter, or

        (B) constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under this subchapter.

    (d) __Election of remedies__
