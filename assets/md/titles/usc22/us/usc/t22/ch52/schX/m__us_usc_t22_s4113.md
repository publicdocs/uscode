    (d) __Applicability to other employee rights or remedies__ 

    The rights of an exclusive representative under this section shall not preclude an employee from—

            (B) which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining; and

        (5) to negotiate jointly with respect to conditions of employment applicable to employees in more than one of the agencies authorized to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system, as determined by the heads of such agencies; and

        (6) if agreement is reached, to execute, upon the request of any party to the negotiation, a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take the steps necessary to implement the agreement.

    (f) __Approval of agreement by Secretary; effective date; binding effect__ 

        (1) An agreement between the Department and the exclusive representative shall be subject to approval by the Secretary.

        (2) The Secretary shall approve the agreement within 30 days after the date of the agreement unless the Secretary finds in writing that the agreement is contrary to applicable law, rule, or regulation.

        (3) Unless the Secretary disapproves the agreement by making a finding under paragraph (2), the agreement shall take effect after 30 days from its execution and shall be binding on the Department and the exclusive representative subject to all applicable laws, orders, and regulations.

    (g) __Consultation by Department with exclusive representative__ 

        The Department shall consult with the exclusive representative with respect to Government-wide or multiagency matters affecting the rights, benefits, or obligations of individuals employed in agencies not authorized to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system. The exclusive representative shall be informed of any change proposed by the Department with respect to such matters, and shall be permitted reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding such change. The Department shall consider the views and recommendations of the exclusive representative before taking final action on any such change, and shall provide the exclusive representative a written statement of the reasons for taking the final action.
