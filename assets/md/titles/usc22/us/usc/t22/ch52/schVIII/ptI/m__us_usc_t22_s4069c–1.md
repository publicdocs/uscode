         The Secretary shall, as soon as possible, take all steps practicable—

            (A) to determine the identity and current address of each former spouse eligible for coverage under subsection (a); and

            (B) to notify each such former spouse of that individual’s rights under this section.

        (3) The Secretary shall waive the 6-month limitation set forth in paragraph (1) in any case in which the Secretary determines that the circumstances so warrant.

    (c) __Disqualification__ 

        (1) Any former spouse who remarries before age 55 is not eligible to make an election under subsection (b)(1).

        (2) Any former spouse enrolled in a health benefits plan pursuant to an election under subsection (b)(1) may continue the enrollment under the conditions of eligibility which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall by regulation prescribe, except that any former spouse who remarries before age 55 shall not be eligible for continued enrollment under this section after the end of the 31-day period beginning on the date of remarriage.

    (d) __Prohibition on coverage by more than one plan__ 

        No individual may be covered by a health benefits plan under this section during any period in which such individual is enrolled in a health benefits plan under any other authority, nor may any individual be covered under more than one enrollment under this section.
