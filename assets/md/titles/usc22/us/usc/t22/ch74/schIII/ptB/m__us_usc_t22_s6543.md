        (2) __Orders, appeals, and payments__ 

            Orders shall be issued in such proceedings, appeals shall be taken therefrom, and payments shall be made pursuant to such orders, as if this part had not been enacted, and orders issued in any such proceedings shall continue in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by a duly authorized official, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law.

        (3) __Statutory construction__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit the discontinuance or modification of any such proceeding under the same terms and conditions and to the same extent that such proceeding could have been discontinued or modified if this part had not been enacted.

            The Board shall participate in suits continued under paragraph (1) where the Broadcasting Board of Governors or other appropriate official of the Board is added as a party and shall be liable for any judgments or remedies in those suits or proceedings arising from the exercise of the functions transferred by this part to the same extent that USIA would have been liable if such judgment or remedy had been rendered on the day before the abolition of USIA.
