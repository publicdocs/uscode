Three members of the Board who are nationals of the United States shall hold no other office in, and shall not be employed by, the Government of the United States, and shall be chosen for the independent perspective they can bring to the Commission’s affairs. Members of the Board who are nationals of the United States shall cast their votes as directed by the the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  officer of the Department of Defense designated by the Secretary of Defense to be a member of the Board.

    (b) __Membership of Board; appointing authority; compensation and travel expenses; compensation for non-Government Board members__

Each member of the Board shall hold office at the pleasure of the President and, before assuming the duties of such office, shall take an oath to discharge faithfully the duties of his office. Members of the Board shall serve without compensation but shall be allowed travel or transportation expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in accordance with [section 3617 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s3617], except that, in addition to such travel or transportation expenses, members of the Board who hold no other office with either the Government of the United States or the Republic of Panama for which they receive pay are authorized to be compensated at the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay in effect for level V of the Executive Schedule under [section 5316 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5316], for each day during which they are traveling to or from or attending meetings of the Board as provided in subsection (c) of this section or, as authorized by the Chairman of the Board, while on official Panama Canal Commission business.
