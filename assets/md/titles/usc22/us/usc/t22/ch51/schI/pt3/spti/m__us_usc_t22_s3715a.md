## § 3715a. Operation of Fund

    (a) __Deposits to Fund__ 

        The Panama Canal Commission shall make deposits on a regular basis to the Fund, beginning on October 1, 1988, to accumulate an amount sufficient to defray the estimated total cost of liability for the workers’ compensation benefits and other payments payable under chapter 81 of title 5 for the disability or death of employees of the Panama Canal Commission or any of its predecessor agencies on account of injuries sustained on or before December 31, 1999, except for those claims arising before, on, or after October 1, 1988, for which the Secretary of Labor has assumed fiscal responsibility.

    (b) __Calculation of amounts to be deposited__ 

        The amounts deposited under subsection (a) shall be based upon periodic actuarial studies conducted by experts or consultants whose services are procured by the Panama Canal Commission by contract. The amounts of such deposits shall take into consideration interest earnings in accordance with subsection (c) of this section and expected cost of living adjustments as provided in [section 8146a of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8146a], but not amounts payable by the Commission for continuation of pay pursuant to section 8118 of such title.

Such interest shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.
