## § 2656a. Congressional declaration of findings of major significance of modern scientific and technological advances in foreign policy

    The Congress finds that—

    (1) the consequences of modern scientific and technological advances are of such major significance in United States foreign policy that understanding and appropriate knowledge of modern science and technology by officers and employees of the United States Government are essential in the conduct of modern diplomacy;

    (2) many problems and opportunities for development in modern diplomacy lie in scientific and technological fields;

    (3) in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the technological aspects of United States foreign policy, the United States Government should seek out and consult with both public and private industrial, academic, and research institutions concerned with modern technology; and

    (4) the effective use of science and technology in international relations for the mutual benefit of all countries requires the development and use of the skills and methods of long-range planning.
