L. 108–487, § 701(a)(2)(B)(i)][/us/pl/108/487/s701/a/2/B/i], by substituting a semicolon for the period, was probably intended as an amendment to subpar. (F) of subsec.

(C) and redesignating former subpars. (C) to (E) as (D) to (F), respectively, was executed by making the amendment to subsec. (b)(3) relating to report provisions with respect to subsec. (a)(2) to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the redesignation of subsec. (b)(2) as (b)(3) by [Pub. L. 108–458][/us/pl/108/458]. See above.
