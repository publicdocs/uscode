## § 2661a. Foreign contracts or arrangements; discrimination

    Information should not be disseminated about opportunities for, and there should be no participation or other assistance by any officer or employee of the Department of State (including the Agency for International Development) in, the negotiation of any contract or arrangement with a foreign country, individual, or entity, if—

    (1) any United States person (as defined in [section 7701(a)(30) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s7701/a/30]) is prohibited from entering into such contract or arrangement, or

    (2) such contract or arrangement requires that any such person be excluded from participating in the implementation of such contract or arrangement,

    on account of the race, religion, national origin, or sex of such person in the case of an individual or, in the case of a partnership, corporation, association, or other entity, any officer, employee, agent, director, or owner thereof.

([Pub. L. 94–350, title I, § 121][/us/pl/94/350/s121], July 12, 1976, [90 Stat. 829][/us/stat/90/829]; [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Par. (1). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
