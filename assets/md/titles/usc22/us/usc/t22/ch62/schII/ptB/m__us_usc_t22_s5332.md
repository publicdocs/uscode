        (2) the United States Executive Director to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to determine the amount of, and alternative methods by which, liquid assets controlled by such Bank and not currently committed to any loan program which, subject to action by its Board of Governors, could be pledged as collateral for obtaining financing for the activities of the authority specified in [section 5331 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s5331].

        The Secretary of the Treasury shall include a report on the results of the review in the first report submitted under [section 5331(c) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s5331/c].
