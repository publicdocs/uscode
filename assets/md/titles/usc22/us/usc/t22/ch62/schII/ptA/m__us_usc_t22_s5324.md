## § 5324. Statement of policy

It is the policy of the United States that—

    (1) increasing growth in the developing world is a major goal of international economic policy;

    (2) it is necessary to broaden the range of options in dealing with the debt problem to include improved mechanisms to restructure existing debt;

    (3) active consideration of a new multilateral authority to improve the management of the debt problem and to share the burdens of adjustment more equitably must be undertaken; and

    (4) countries with strong current account surpluses bear a major responsibility for providing the financial resources needed for growth in the developing world.
