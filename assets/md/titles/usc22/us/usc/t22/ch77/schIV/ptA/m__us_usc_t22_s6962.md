## § 6962. Functions of Task Force

The Task Force shall monitor and promote effective enforcement of and compliance with [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307] by performing the following functions:

    (1) Coordinate closely with the United States Customs Service to promote maximum effectiveness in the enforcement by the Customs Service of [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307] with respect to the products of the People’s Republic of China. In order to assure such coordination, the Customs Service shall keep the Task Force informed, on a regular basis, of the progress of its investigations of allegations that goods are being entered into the United States, or that such entry is being attempted, in violation of the prohibition in [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307] on entry into the United States of goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the People’s Republic of China by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions. Such investigations may include visits to foreign sites where goods allegedly are being mined, produced, or manufactured in a manner that would lead to prohibition of their importation into the United States under [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307].

    (2) Make recommendations to the Customs Service on seeking new agreements with the People’s Republic of China to allow Customs Service officials to visit sites where goods may be mined, produced, or manufactured by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions.

    (3) Work with the Customs Service to assist the People’s Republic of China and other foreign governments in monitoring the sale of goods mined, produced, or manufactured by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions to ensure that such goods are not exported to the United States.

    (4) Coordinate closely with the Customs Service to promote maximum effectiveness in the enforcement by the Customs Service of [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307] with respect to the products of the People’s Republic of China. In order to assure such coordination, the Customs Service shall keep the Task Force informed, on a regular basis, of the progress of its monitoring of ports of the United States to ensure that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the People’s Republic of China by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions are not imported into the United States.

    (5) Advise the Customs Service in performing such other functions, consistent with existing authority, to ensure the effective enforcement of [section 1307 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1307].

    (6) Provide to the Customs Service all information obtained by the departments represented on the Task Force relating to the use of convict labor, forced labor, or/and indentured labor under penal sanctions in the mining, production, or manufacture of goods which may be imported into the United States.
