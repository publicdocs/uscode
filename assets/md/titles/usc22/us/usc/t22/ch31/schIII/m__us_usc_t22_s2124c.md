    (a) __Establishment of Foundation__

    (b) __Functions__ 

    The functions of the Foundation shall be the planning, development, and implementation of projects and programs which have the potential to increase travel and tourism export revenues by attracting foreign visitors to rural America. Initially, such projects and programs shall include—

        (1) participation in the development and distribution of educational and promotional materials pertaining to both private and public attractions located in rural areas of the United States, including Federal parks and recreational lands, which can be used by foreign visitors;

        (2) development of educational resources to assist in private and public rural tourism development; and

        (3) participation in Federal agency outreach efforts to make such resources available to private enterprises, State and local governments, and other persons and entities interested in rural tourism development.

    (c) __Board of Directors__ 

        (1) __Composition__

             The Foundation shall have a Board of Directors (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Board”) that—

                (i) during its first two years shall consist of nine voting members; and

                (ii) thereafter shall consist of those nine members plus up to six additional voting members as determined in accordance with the bylaws of the Foundation.

            (B)

                (i) The Secretary of Commerce shall, within six months after September 30, 1992, appoint the initial nine voting members of the Board and thereafter shall appoint the successors of each of three such members, as provided by such bylaws.

                (ii) The voting members of the Board, other than those referred to in clause (i), shall be appointed in accordance with procedures established by such bylaws.

            (C) The voting members of the Board shall be individuals who are not Federal officers or employees and who have demonstrated an interest in rural tourism development. Of such voting members, at least a majority shall have experience and expertise in tourism trade promotion, at least one shall have experience and expertise in resource conservation, at least one shall have experience and expertise in financial administration in a fiduciary capacity, at least one shall be a representative of an Indian tribe who has experience and expertise in rural tourism on an Indian reservation, at least one shall represent a regional or national organization or association with a major interest in rural tourism development or promotion, and at least one shall be a representative of a State who is responsible for tourism promotion.

            (D)

             Voting members of the Board shall each serve a term of six years, except that—

                (i) initial terms shall be staggered to assure continuity of administration;

                (ii) if a person is appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term of the person’s predecessor, that person shall serve only for the remainder of the predecessor’s term; and

                (iii) any such appointment to fill a vacancy shall be made within sixty days after the vacancy occurs.

        (2) __Ex-officio members__ 

            The Secretary of Commerce and representatives of Federal agencies with responsibility for Federal recreational sites in rural areas (including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Tennessee Valley Authority, and such other Federal agencies as the Board determines appropriate) shall be nonvoting ex-officio members of the Board.

        (3) __Chair__ 

            The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board shall be elected by the voting members of the Board for terms of two years.

A majority of the voting members of the Board serving at any one time shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The Foundation shall have an official seal, which shall be judicially noticed. Voting membership on the Board shall not be deemed to be an office within the meaning of the laws of the United States.

    (d) __Compensation and expenses__ 

        No compensation shall be paid to the members of the Board for their services as members, but they may be reimbursed for actual and necessary traveling and subsistence expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties as such members out of Foundation funds available to the Board for such purposes.

    (e) __Acceptance of gifts, devises, and bequests__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Foundation is authorized to accept, receive, solicit, hold, administer, and use any gifts, devises, or bequests, either absolutely or in trust, of real or personal property or any income therefrom or other interest therein for the benefit of or in connection with rural tourism, except that the Foundation may not accept any such gift, devise, or bequest which entails any expenditure other than from the resources of the Foundation. A gift, devise, or bequest may be accepted by the Foundation even though it is encumbered, restricted, or subject to beneficial interests of private persons if any current or future interest therein is for the benefit of rural tourism.

            A gift, devise, or bequest accepted by the Foundation for the benefit of or in connection with rural tourism on Indian reservations, pursuant to [section 451 of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s451], shall be maintained in a separate accounting for the benefit of Indian tribes in the development of tourism on Indian reservations.

    (f) __Investments__ 

        Except as otherwise required by the instrument of transfer, the Foundation may sell, lease, invest, reinvest, retain, or otherwise dispose of or deal with any property or income thereof as the Board may from time to time determine. The Foundation shall not engage in any business, nor shall the Foundation make any investment that may not lawfully be made by a trust company in the District of Columbia, except that the Foundation may make any investment authorized by the instrument of transfer and may retain any property accepted by the Foundation.

    (g) __Perpetual succession; liability of Board members__
