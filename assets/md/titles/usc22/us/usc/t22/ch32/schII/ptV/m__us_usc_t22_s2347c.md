    (a) __Attendance of foreign military personnel at professional military education institutions__ 

        In carrying out this part, the President is authorized to provide for attendance of foreign military personnel at professional military education institutions in the United States (other than service academies) without charge, and without charge to funds available to carry out this part (notwithstanding [section 2392(d) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2392/d]), if such attendance is pursuant to an agreement providing for the exchange of students on a one-for-one, reciprocal basis each fiscal year between those United States professional military education institutions and comparable institutions of foreign countries and international organizations.

    (b) __Attendance of foreign military and civilian defense personnel at flight training schools and programs__ 

        The President may provide for the attendance of foreign military and civilian defense personnel at flight training schools and programs (including test pilot schools) in the United States without charge, and without charge to funds available to carry out this part (notwithstanding [section 2392(d) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2392/d]), if such attendance is pursuant to an agreement providing for the exchange of students on a one-for-one basis each fiscal year between those United States flight training schools and programs (including test pilot schools) and comparable flight training schools and programs of foreign countries.

    (c) __Post-undergraduate flying training and tactical leadership programs at training locations in Southwest Asia__ 

        (1) The President is authorized to enter into cooperative arrangements providing for the participation of foreign and United States military and civilian defense personnel in post-undergraduate flying training and tactical leadership programs at training locations in Southwest Asia without charge to participating foreign countries, and without charge to funds available to carry out this part (notwithstanding [section 2392(d) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2392/d]).
