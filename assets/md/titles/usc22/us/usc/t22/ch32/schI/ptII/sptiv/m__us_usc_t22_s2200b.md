## § 2200b. Prohibition on noncompetitive awarding of insurance contracts on OPIC supported exports

    (a) __Requirement for certification__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (3), the investor on whose behalf insurance, reinsurance, guaranties, or other financing is provided under this subpart with respect to a project shall be required to certify to the Corporation that any contract for the export of goods as part of that project will include a clause requiring that United States insurance companies have a fair and open competitive opportunity to provide insurance against risk of loss of such export.

        (2) __When certification must be made__ 

            The investor shall be required, in every practicable case, to so certify before the insurance, reinsurance, guarantee, or other financing is provided. In any case in which such a certification is not made in advance, the investor shall include in the certification the reasons for the failure to make a certification in advance.

        (3) __Exception__ 

            Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to an investor who does not, because of the nature of the investment, have a controlling interest in fact in the project in question.

    (b) __Reports by United States Trade Representative__ 

        The United States Trade Representative shall review the actions of the Corporation under subsection (a) of this section and, after consultation with representatives of United States insurance companies, shall report to the Congress in the report required by [section 2241(b) of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s2241/b] with respect to such actions.
