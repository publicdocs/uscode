    (b) __Consistency with United Nations principles__ 

        The code of conduct referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be consistent with the six core principles of the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises.
