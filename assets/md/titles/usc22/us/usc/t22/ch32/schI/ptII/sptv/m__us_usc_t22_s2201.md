## § 2201. Assistance to disadvantaged children in Asia

    (a) __Congressional findings__ 

        The Congress recognizes the humanitarian needs of disadvantaged children in Asian countries where there has been or continues to be a heavy presence of United States military and related personnel in recent years. Moreover, the Congress finds that inadequate provision has been made for the care and welfare of such disadvantaged children, particularly those fathered by the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  United States citizens.

    (b) __Authority of President__ 

        Accordingly, the President is authorized to expend up to $3,000,000 of funds made available under part I of this subchapter, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, to help meet the needs of these disadvantaged children in Asia by assisting in the expansion and improvement of orphanages, hostels, day care centers, school feeding programs, and health, education, and welfare programs. Assistance provided under this section shall be furnished under the auspices of and by international organizations or private voluntary agencies operating within, and in cooperation with, the countries of Asia where these disadvantaged children reside.
