## § 2151q. Endangered species

    (a) __Congressional findings and purposes__ 

        The Congress finds the survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by over-hunting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats. The Congress further finds that the extinction of animal and plant species is an irreparable loss with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences for developing and developed countries alike. Accordingly, the preservation of animal and plant species through the regulation of the hunting and trade in endangered species, through limitations on the pollution of natural ecosystems, and through the protection of wildlife habitats should be an important objective of the United States development assistance.

    (b) __Remedial measures__ 

        In order to preserve biological diversity, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter, notwithstanding [section 2420 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2420], to assist countries in protecting and maintaining wildlife habitats and in developing sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs. Special efforts should be made to establish and maintain wildlife sanctuaries, reserves, and parks; to enact and enforce anti-poaching measures; and to identify, study, and catalog animal and plant species, especially in tropical environments.

    (c) __Funding level__ 

        For fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,500,000 of the funds available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter (excluding funds made available to carry out [section 2151b(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151b/c/2], relating to the Child Survival Fund) shall be allocated for assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities which were not funded prior to fiscal year 1987. In addition, the Agency for International Development shall, to the fullest extent possible, continue and increase assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities for which assistance was provided in fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1987.

    (d) __Country analysis requirements__ 

    Each country development strategy statement or other country plan prepared by the Agency for International Development shall include an analysis of—

        (1) the actions necessary in that country to conserve biological diversity, and

        (2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by the Agency meet the needs thus identified.

    (e) __Local involvement__ 

        To the fullest extent possible, projects supported under this section shall include close consultation with and involvement of local people at all stages of design and implementation.

    (f) __PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations__ 

        Whenever feasible, the objectives of this section shall be accomplished through projects managed by appropriate private and voluntary organizations, or international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations, which are active in the region or country where the project is located.

    (g) __Actions by AID__ 

    The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall—

        (1) cooperate with appropriate international organizations, both governmental and nongovernmental;

        (2) look to the World Conservation Strategy as an overall guide for actions to conserve biological diversity;

        (3) engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries which stress the importance of conserving biological diversity for the long-term economic benefit of those countries and which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to loss of biological diversity;

        (4) support training and education efforts which improve the capacity of recipient countries to prevent loss of biological diversity;

        (5) whenever possible, enter into long-term agreements in which the recipient country agrees to protect ecosystems or other wildlife habitats recommended for protection by relevant governmental or nongovernmental organizations or as a result of activities undertaken pursuant to paragraph (6), and the United States agrees to provide, subject to obtaining the necessary appropriations, additional assistance necessary for the establishment and maintenance of such protected areas;

        (6) support, as necessary and in cooperation with the appropriate governmental and nongovernmental organizations, efforts to identify and survey ecosystems in recipient countries worthy of protection;

        (7) cooperate with and support the relevant efforts of other agencies of the United States Government, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, and the Peace Corps;

        (8) review the Agency’s environmental regulations and revise them as necessary to ensure that ongoing and proposed actions by the Agency do not inadvertently endanger wildlife species or their critical habitats, harm protected areas, or have other adverse impacts on biological diversity (and shall report to the Congress within a year after October 24, 1986, on the actions taken pursuant to this paragraph);

        (9) ensure that environmental profiles sponsored by the Agency include information needed for conservation of biological diversity; and

        (10) deny any direct or indirect assistance under this part for actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.

    (h) __Annual reports__ 

        Each annual report required by [section 2394(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2394/a] shall include, in a separate volume, a report on the implementation of this section.
