## § 2392. Government agencies

    (a) __Allocation and transfer of funds__ 

        The President may allocate or transfer to any agency of the United States Government any part of any funds available for carrying out the purposes of this chapter, including any advance to the United States Government by any country or international organization for the procurement of commodities, defense articles, military education and training, or services (including defense services). Such funds shall be available for obligation and expenditure for the purposes for which authorized, in accordance with authority granted in this chapter or under authority governing the activities of the agencies of the United States Government to which such funds are allocated or transferred.

    (b) __Utilization of services and facilities of other agencies__ 

        Any officer of the United States Government carrying out functions under this chapter may utilize the services (including defense services) and facilities of, or procure commodities, defense articles, or military education and training from, any agency of the United States Government as the President shall direct, or with the consent of the head of such agency, and funds allocated pursuant to this subsection to any such agency may be established in separate appropriation accounts on the books of the Treasury.

    (c) __Reimbursement for commodities, services, and facilities__ 

        In the case of any commodity, service, or facility procured from any agency of the United States Government to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, reimbursement or payment shall be made to such agency from funds available to carry out such subchapter. Such reimbursement or payment shall be at replacement cost, or, if required by law, at actual cost, or, in the case of services procured from the Department of Defense to carry out part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, the amount of the additional costs incurred by the Department of Defense in providing such services, or at any other price authorized by law and agreed to by the owning or disposing agency. The amount of any such reimbursement or payment shall be credited to current applicable appropriations, funds, or accounts, from which there may be procured replacements of similar commodities, services, or facilities, except that where such appropriations, funds, or accounts are not reimbursable except by reason of this subsection, and when the owning or disposing agency determines that such replacement is not necessary, any funds received in payment therefor shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

    (d) __Reimbursement for military assistance__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in [section 2318 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2318], reimbursement shall be made to any United States Government agency, from funds available for use under subchapter II of this chapter, for any assistance furnished under subchapter II of this chapter, from, by, or through such agency. Such reimbursement shall be in an amount equal to the value (as defined in [section 2403(m) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2403/m]) of the defense articles or of the defense services (other than salaries of members of the Armed Forces of the United States), or other assistance furnished, plus expenses arising from or incident to operations under subchapter II of this chapter (other than salaries of the Armed Forces of the United States and unfunded estimated costs of civilian retirement and other benefits). The amount of such reimbursement shall be credited to the current applicable appropriations, funds, or accounts of such agency.

    (e) __Establishment of accounts__ 

        In furnishing assistance under this chapter, accounts may be established on the books of any agency of the United States Government or, on terms and conditions approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in banking institutions in the United States, (1) against which letters of commitment may be issued which shall constitute recordable obligations of the United States Government, and moneys due or to become due under such letters of commitment shall be assignable under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  (second and third paragraphs of [31 U.S.C. 203][/us/usc/t31/s203] and [41 U.S.C. 15][/us/usc/t41/s15]), and (2) from which disbursements may be made to, or withdrawals may be made by, recipient countries or agencies, organizations, or persons upon presentation of contracts, invoices, or other appropriate documentation. Expenditure of funds which have been made available through accounts so established shall be accounted for on standard documentation required for expenditure of funds of the United States Government: Provided, That such expenditures for commodities, defense articles, military education and training, services (including defense services), or facilities procured outside the United States may be accounted for exclusively on such certification as may be prescribed in regulations approved by the Comptroller General of the United States.

    (f) __Credits made by Export-Import Bank of the United States__ 

        Credits made by the Export-Import Bank of the United States with funds allocated thereto under subsection (a) of this section or under section 1782(a) 1 of this title, shall not be considered in determining whether the Bank has outstanding at any one time loans and guaranties to the extent of the limitation imposed by [section 635e of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s635e].

    (g) __Charge of expenses to appropriation or account__ 

        Any appropriation or account available to carry out provisions of subchapter I of this chapter may initially be charged in any fiscal year, within the limit of available funds, to finance expenses for which funds are available in other appropriations or accounts under subchapter I of this chapter: Provided, That as of the end of such fiscal year such expenses shall be finally charged to applicable appropriations or accounts with proper credit to the appropriations or accounts initially utilized for financing purposes: Provided further, That such final charge to applicable appropriations or accounts shall not be required in the case of expenses (other than those provided for under [section 2397(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2397/a]) incurred in furnishing assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter where it is determined that the accounting costs of identifying the applicable appropriation or account to which such expenses should be charged would be disproportionate to the advantage to be gained.
