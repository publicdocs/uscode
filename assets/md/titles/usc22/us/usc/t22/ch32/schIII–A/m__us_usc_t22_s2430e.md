## § 2430e. Interest on new obligations

    (a) __Rate of interest__ 

        New obligations issued by a beneficiary country pursuant to [section 2430c(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2430c/b] shall bear interest at a concessional rate.

    (b) __Currency of payment; deposits__ 

        (1) __Local currency__ 

            If the beneficiary country has entered into an Americas Framework Agreement, interest shall be paid in the local currency of the beneficiary country and deposited in an Americas Fund. Such interest shall be the property of the beneficiary country, until such time as it is disbursed pursuant to [section 2430f(d) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2430f/d]. Such local currencies shall be used for the purposes specified in the Americas Framework Agreement.

        (2) __United States dollars__ 

            If the beneficiary country has not entered into an Americas Framework Agreement, interest shall be paid in United States dollars and deposited in the United States Government account established for interest payments of the obligations for which the new obligations were exchanged.

    (c) __Interest already paid__ 

        If a beneficiary country enters into an Americas Framework Agreement subsequent to the date on which interest first became due on the newly issued obligation, any interest already paid on such new obligation shall not be redeposited into the Americas Fund established for that country.
