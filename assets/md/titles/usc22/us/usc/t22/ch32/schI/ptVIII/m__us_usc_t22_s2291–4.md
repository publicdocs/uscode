        (2)

         the President of the United States has, during the 12-month period ending on the date of the interdiction, certified to Congress with respect to that country that—

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall not be unlawful for authorized employees or agents of the United States (including members of the Armed Forces of the United States) to provide assistance for the interdiction actions of foreign countries authorized under subsection (a) of this section.

    (c) __Annual report__ 

        (1)

         Except as provided in paragraph (2), not later than February 1 each year, the President shall submit to Congress a report on the assistance provided under subsection (b) of this section during the preceding calendar year.
