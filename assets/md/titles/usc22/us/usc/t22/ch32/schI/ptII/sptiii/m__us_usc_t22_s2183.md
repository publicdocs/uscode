## § 2183. General provisions

    (a) __Fees; determination by President; reduction__ 

        A fee shall be charged for each guaranty issued under section 2182 or 2182a of this title in an amount to be determined by the President. In the event the fee to be charged for such type of guaranty is reduced, fees to be paid under existing contracts for the same type of guaranty may be similarly reduced.

    (b) __Accumulated and existing fees; expenditure of fees; revolving fund account; investments; use of investment income__ 

        The amount of $50,000,000 of fees accumulated under prior investment guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, together with all fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182] or under prior housing guaranty authorities, shall be available for meeting necessary administrative and operating expenses of carrying out the provisions of [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182] and administering housing guaranties heretofore authorized under this subpart and under prior housing guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 (including, but not limited to expenses pertaining to personnel, supplies, and printing), subject to such limitations as may be imposed in annual appropriation Acts; for meeting management and custodial costs incurred with respect to currencies or other assets acquired under guaranties made pursuant to [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182] or heretofore pursuant to this subpart or prior Latin American and other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969; and to pay the cost of investigating and adjusting (including costs of arbitration) claims under such guaranties; and shall be available for expenditure in discharge of liabilities under such guaranties until such time as all such property has been disposed of and all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired, or until all such fees have been expended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under [section 2182a of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182a] shall likewise be available to meet similar expenses, costs, or liabilities incurred in connection with the programs authorized by that section. All of the foregoing fees referred to in this section together with earnings thereon and other income arising from guaranty operations under this subpart shall be held in a revolving fund account maintained in the Treasury of the United States. All funds in such account may be invested in obligations of the United States. Any interest or other receipts derived from such investments shall be credited to such account and may be used for the purposes cited in this section.

    (c) __Priorities of funds for guaranty payments__ 

        Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182] or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, shall be paid first out of fees referred to in subsection (b) (excluding amounts required for purposes other than the discharge of liabilities under guaranties) as long as such fees are available, and thereafter shall be paid out of funds, if any, realized from the sale of currencies or other assets acquired in connection with any payment made to discharge liabilities under such guaranties as long as funds are available, and finally out of funds hereafter made available pursuant to subsection (e).

    (d) __Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States__ 

        All guaranties issued under section 2182 or 2182a, or previously under [section 2200 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2200] or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authority repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.

    (e) __Authorization of appropriations; borrowing authority__ 

        (1) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the President such amounts, to remain available until expended, as may be necessary from time to time to carry out the purposes of this subpart.

        (2)

            (A)

             In order to meet obligations incurred for the payment of claims pursuant to loan guaranties described in subsection (d), the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter may, to the extent that reserves are not sufficient, borrow from time to time from the Treasury, except that—

                (i) the Administrator may exercise the authority to borrow under this paragraph only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts; and

                (ii) the amount borrowed under this paragraph which is outstanding at any one time may not exceed $100,000,000.

            (B) Any such borrowing shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into account the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make loans under this paragraph and for such purpose may borrow on the credit of the United States in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 31 of title 31.

    (f) __Agency determination of maximum rate of interest__ 

        In the case of any loan investment guaranteed under [section 2182 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2182], the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall prescribe the maximum rate of interest allowable to the eligible investor, which maximum rate shall not exceed by more than 1 per centum the then current rate of interest applicable to housing mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The maximum allowable rate of interest under this subsection shall be prescribed by the agency as of the date the project covered by the investment is officially authorized and, prior to the execution of the contract, the agency may amend such rate at its discretion, consistent with the provisions of this subsection.

    (g) __Guaranties under prior acts__ 

        Housing guaranties committed, authorized, or outstanding heretofore under this subpart or under prior housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall continue subject to provisions of law originally applicable thereto and fees collected hereafter with respect to such guaranties shall be available for the purposes specified in subsection (b).

    (h) __Fraud or misrepresentation__ 

        No payment may be made under any guaranty issued pursuant to this subpart for any loss arising out of fraud or misrepresentation for which the party seeking payment is responsible.

Of the aggregate face value of housing guaranties hereafter issued under this subpart, not less than 90 per centum shall be issued for housing suitable for families with income below the median income (below the median urban income for housing in urban areas) in the country in which the housing is located.
