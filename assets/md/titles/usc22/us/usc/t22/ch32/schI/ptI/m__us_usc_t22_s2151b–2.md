    (b) __Policy__ 

        (1) __Objectives__ 

        It is a major objective of the foreign assistance program of the United States to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and the care of those affected by the disease. It is the policy objective of the United States, by 2013, to—

            (A)

             assist partner countries to—

                (i) prevent 12,000,000 new HIV infections worldwide;

                    (II) additional treatment through coordinated multilateral efforts;

                (iii) support care for 12,000,000 individuals infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS, including 5,000,000 orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, with an emphasis on promoting a comprehensive, coordinated system of services to be integrated throughout the continuum of care;

                (v) provide care and treatment services to children with HIV in proportion to their percentage within the HIV-infected population of a given partner country; and

                (vi) train and support retention of health care professionals, paraprofessionals, and community health workers in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care, with the target of providing such training to at least 140,000 new health care professionals and paraprofessionals with an emphasis on training and in country deployment of critically needed doctors and nurses;

            (B) strengthen the capacity to deliver primary health care in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;

            (D) help partner countries to develop independent, sustainable HIV/AIDS programs.

        (2) __Coordinated global strategy__ 

            The United States and other countries with the sufficient capacity should provide assistance to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and other countries and regions confronting HIV/AIDS epidemics in a coordinated global strategy to help address generalized and concentrated epidemics through HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, monitoring and evaluation, and related activities.
