## § 2291c. Requirements relating to aircraft and other equipment

    (a) __Retention of title to aircraft__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any aircraft made available to a foreign country under this part, or made available to a foreign country primarily for narcotics-related purposes under any other provision of law, shall be provided only on a lease or loan basis.

            (B) Subparagraph (A) applies to aircraft made available at any time after October 27, 1986 (which was the date of enactment of the International Narcotics Control Act of 1986).

        (2) __Exceptions__ 

            (A)

             Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the extent that—

                (i) the application of that paragraph with respect to particular aircraft would be contrary to the national interest of the United States; and

                (ii) the President notifies the appropriate congressional committees in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under [section 2394–1 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2394–1].

            (B) Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to aircraft made available to a foreign country under any provision of law that authorizes property that has been civilly or criminally forfeited to the United States to be made available to foreign countries.

        (3) __Assistance for leasing of aircraft__ 

            (A) For purposes of satisfying the requirement of paragraph (1), funds made available for the “Foreign Military Financing Program” under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2763][/us/usc/t22/s2763]\] may be used to finance the leasing of aircraft under chapter 6 of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2796][/us/usc/t22/s2796] et seq.\].

            (B) Section 61(a)(3)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2796(a)(3)][/us/usc/t22/s2796/a/3]\] shall not apply with respect to leases so financed; rather the entire cost of any such lease (including any renewals) shall be an initial, one time payment of the amount which would be the sales price for the aircraft if they were sold under section 21(a)(1)(B) or section 22 of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2761(a)(1)(B)][/us/usc/t22/s2761/a/1/B], 2762\] (as appropriate).

            (C) To the extent that aircraft so leased were acquired under chapter 5 of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2795][/us/usc/t22/s2795] et seq.\], funds used pursuant to this paragraph to finance such leases shall be credited to the Special Defense Acquisition Fund under chapter 5 of that Act (excluding the amount of funds that reflects the charges described in section 21(e)(1) of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2761(e)(1)][/us/usc/t22/s2761/e/1]\]). The funds described in the parenthetical clause of the preceding sentence shall be available for payments consistent with sections 37(a) and 43(b) of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2777(a)][/us/usc/t22/s2777/a], 2792(b)\].

    (b) __Permissible uses of aircraft and other equipment__

    (c) __Reports__ 

    In the reports submitted pursuant to [section 2291h(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2291h/a], the President shall discuss—

        (1) any evidence indicating misuse by a foreign country of aircraft or other equipment made available under this part, and

        (2) the actions taken by the United States Government to prevent future misuse of such equipment by that foreign country.
