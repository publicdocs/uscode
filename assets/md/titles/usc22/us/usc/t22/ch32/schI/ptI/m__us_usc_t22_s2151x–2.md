        The provisions of law made inapplicable by subsection (a) of this section are any other provisions of law that would otherwise restrict the use of economic assistance funds with respect to the production, processing, or marketing of agricultural commodities (or the products thereof) or other products, including sections 521, 546, and 547 (but excluding section 510) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990, and comparable provisions of subsequent Acts appropriating funds for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs.
