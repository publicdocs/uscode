## § 2394–1. Notification of program changes

    (a) __Covered programs; content of notifications__ 

    None of the funds appropriated to carry out the purposes of this chapter (except for programs under subpart III or subpart IV of part II of subchapter I of this chapter, part V of subchapter I of this chapter, and programs of disaster relief and rehabilitation) or the Arms Export Control Act \[[22 U.S.C. 2751][/us/usc/t22/s2751] et seq.\] may be obligated for any activities, programs, projects, types of materiel assistance, countries, or other operations not justified, or in excess of the amount justified, to the Congress for obligation under this chapter or the Arms Export Control Act for any fiscal year unless the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Appropriations of each House of the Congress are notified fifteen days in advance of such obligation. Whenever a proposed reprograming exceeds $1,000,000 and the total amount proposed for obligation for a country under this chapter in a fiscal year exceeds by more than $5,000,000 the amount specified for that country in the report required by [section 2413(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2413/a], notifications of such proposed reprogramings shall specify—

        (1) the nature and purpose of such proposed obligation, and

        (2) to the extent possible at the time of the proposed obligation, the country for which such funds would otherwise have been obligated.

    (b) __Exceptions__ 

    The notification requirement of this section does not apply to the reprogramming—

        (1) of funds to be used for an activity, program, or project under part I of subchapter I of this chapter if the amounts to be obligated for that activity, program, or project for that fiscal year do not exceed by more than 10 percent the amount justified to the Congress for that activity, program, or project for that fiscal year; or

        (2) of less than $25,000 to be used under part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, or under part V of subchapter II of this chapter, for a country for which a program under that part for that fiscal year was justified to the Congress.

    (c) __Funds in the International Affairs Budget Function; reprogramming__ 

        The President shall notify the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives concerning any reprogramming of funds in the International Affairs Budget Function, the authorizations of appropriations for which are in their respective jurisdictions, to the same degree and with the same conditions as the President notifies the Committees on Appropriations. The requirements of this subsection are in addition to, and not in lieu of, other notification requirements.
