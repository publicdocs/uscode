>     “(a)

>         (1) Congress finds that the Government of Portugal’s recognition of the right to independence of the African territories of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau marks a significant advance toward the goal of self-determination for all the peoples of Africa, without which peace on the continent is not secure.

>         “(2) Congress finds that progress toward independence for the Portuguese African territories will have a significant impact on the international organizations and the community of nations.

>         “(3) Congress commends the Portuguese Government’s initiatives on these fronts as evidence of a reaffirmation of that Government’s support for her obligations under both the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

>     “(b)

>      Therefore, Congress calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to make clear United States support for a peaceful and orderly transition to independence in the Portuguese African territories:

>         “(1) An official statement should be issued of United States support for the independence of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and of our desire to have good relations with the future governments of the countries.

>         “(2) It should be made clear to the Government of of Portugal that we view the efforts toward a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict in the African territories as consistent with Portugal’s obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partnership.

>         “(3) The United States should encourage United Nations support for a peaceful transition to independence, negotiated settlement of all differences, and the protection of human rights of all citizens of the three territories.

>         “(4) The United States should open a dialog with potential leaders of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and assure them of our commitment to their genuine political and economic independence.

>         “(5) The economic development needs of the three territories will be immense when independence is achieved. Therefore, it is urged that the United States Agency for International Development devote attention to assessing the economic situation in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and be ready to cooperate with the future governments in providing the kind of assistance that will help make their independence viable. In addition, the United States Government should take the initiative among other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, in seeking significant contribution of development assistance for the three territories.

>         “(6) In light of the need of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau for skilled and educated manpower, a priority consideration should be given to expanding current United States programs of educational assistance to the territories as a timely and substantive contribution to their independence.
