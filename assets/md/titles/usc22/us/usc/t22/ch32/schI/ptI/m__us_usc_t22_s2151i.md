## § 2151i. Development and use of cooperatives

    In order to strengthen the participation of the rural and urban poor in their country’s development, high priority shall be given to increasing the use of funds made available under this chapter for technical and capital assistance in the development and use of cooperatives in the less developed countries which will enable and encourage greater numbers of the poor to help themselves toward a better life. In meeting the requirement of the preceding sentence, specific priority shall be given to the following:

    (1) __Agriculture__ 

        Technical assistance to low income farmers who form and develop member-owned cooperatives for farm supplies, marketing and value-added processing.

    (2) __Financial systems__ 

        The promotion of national credit union systems through credit union-to-credit union technical assistance that strengthens the ability of low income people and micro-entrepreneurs to save and to have access to credit for their own economic advancement.

    (3) __Infrastructure__ 

        The support of rural electric and telecommunication cooperatives for access for rural people and villages that lack reliable electric and telecommunications services.

    (4) __Housing and community services__ 

        The promotion of community-based cooperatives which provide employment opportunities and important services such as health clinics, self-help shelter, environmental improvements, group-owned businesses, and other activities.
