## § 2194. Investment insurance and other programs

    The Corporation is hereby authorized to do the following:

    (a) __Investment insurance__ 

        (1)

            (C) loss due to war, revolution, insurrection, or civil strife; and

            (D) loss due to business interruption caused by any of the risks set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).

        (2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.

        (3) Not more than 10 per centum of the maximum contingent liability of investment insurance which the Corporation is permitted to have outstanding under section 2195(a)(1)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title shall be issued to a single investor.

        (4) Before issuing insurance for the first time for loss due to business interruption, and in each subsequent instance in which a significant expansion is proposed in the type of risk to be insured under the definition of “civil strife” or “business interruption”, the Corporation shall, at least sixty days before such insurance is issued, submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report with respect to such insurance, including a thorough analysis of the risks to be covered, anticipated losses, and proposed rates and reserves and, in the case of insurance for loss due to business interruption, an explanation of the underwriting basis upon which the insurance is to be offered. Any such report with respect to insurance for loss due to business interruption shall be considered in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications pursuant to [section 2394–1 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2394–1].

    (b) __Investment guaranties__ 

        To issue to eligible investors guaranties of loans and other investments made by such investors assuring against loss due to such risks and upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine: Provided, however, That such guaranties on other than loan investments shall not exceed 75 per centum of such investment: Provided further, That except for loan investments for credit unions made by eligible credit unions or credit union associations, the aggregate amount of investment (exclusive of interest and earnings) so guaranteed with respect to any project shall not exceed, at the time of issuance of any such guaranty, 75 per centum of the total investment committed to any such project as determined by the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive for purposes of the Corporation’s authority to issue any such guaranty: Provided further, That not more than 15 per centum of the maximum contingent liability of investment guaranties which the Corporation is permitted to have outstanding under section 2195(a)(2) 1 of this title shall be issued to a single investor.

    (c) __Direct investment__ 

        To make loans in United States dollars repayable in dollars or loans in foreign currencies (including, without regard to [section 1306 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1306], such foreign currencies which the Secretary of the Treasury may determine to be excess to the normal requirements of the United States and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may allocate) to firms privately owned or of mixed private and public ownership upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine. Loans may be made under this subsection only for projects that are sponsored by or significantly involve United States small business or cooperatives.

        The Corporation may designate up to 25 percent of any loan under this subsection for use in the development or adaptation in the United States of new technologies or new products or services that are to be used in the project for which the loan is made and are likely to contribute to the economic or social development of less developed countries.

        No loan may be made under this subsection to finance any operation for the extraction of oil or gas. The aggregate amount of loans under this subsection to finance operations for the mining or other extraction of any deposit of ore or other nonfuel minerals may not in any fiscal year exceed $4,000,000.

    (d) __Investment encouragement__ 

    To initiate and support through financial participation, incentive grant, or otherwise, and on such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine, the identification, assessment, surveying and promotion of private investment opportunities, utilizing wherever feasible and effective the facilities of private organizations or private investors, except that—

        (1) the Corporation shall not finance any survey to ascertain the existence, location, extent, or quality of, or to determine the feasibility of undertaking operations for the extraction of, oil or gas; and

        (2) expenditures financed by the Corporation during any fiscal year on surveys to ascertain the existence, location, extent, or quality of, or to determine the feasibility of undertaking operations for the extraction of nonfuel minerals may not exceed $200,000.

    (e) __Special projects and programs__

    (g) __Pilot equity finance program__ 

        (1) __Authority for pilot program__ 

        In order to study the feasibility and desirability of a program of equity financing, the Corporation is authorized to establish a 4-year pilot program under which it may, on the limited basis prescribed in paragraphs (2) through (5), purchase, invest in, or otherwise acquire equity or quasi-equity securities of any firm or entity, upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine, for the purpose of providing capital for any project which is consistent with the provisions of this subpart, except that—

        (3) __Additional criteria__ 

            In making investment decisions under this subsection, the Corporation shall give preferential consideration to projects sponsored by or significantly involving United States small business or cooperatives. The Corporation shall also consider the extent to which the Corporation’s equity investment will assist in obtaining the financing required for the project.

        (5) __Implementation__
