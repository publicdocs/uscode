L. 87–195][/us/pl/87/195], Sept. 4, 1961, [75 Stat. 424][/us/stat/75/424], as amended, known as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.

 __Congressional Findings__

> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1) international terrorism is among the most serious transnational threats faced by the United States and its allies, far eclipsing the dangers posed by population growth or pollution;

>     “(2) the President should continue to make efforts to counter international terrorism a national security priority;

>     “(3) because the United Nations has been an inadequate forum for the discussion of cooperative, multilateral responses to the threat of international terrorism, the President should undertake immediate efforts to develop effective multilateral responses to international terrorism as a complement to national counter terrorist efforts;

>     “(4) the President should use all necessary means, including covert action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy international infrastructure used by international terrorists, including overseas terrorist training facilities and safe havens;

>     “(5) the Congress deplores decisions to ease, evade, or end international sanctions on state sponsors of terrorism, including the recent decision by the United Nations Sanctions Committee to allow airline flights to and from Libya despite Libya’s noncompliance with United Nations resolutions; and

>     “(6) the President should continue to undertake efforts to increase the international isolation of state sponsors of international terrorism, including efforts to strengthen international sanctions, and should oppose any future initiatives to ease sanctions on Libya or other state sponsors of terrorism.”

    Assistance defined for purposes of title III of [Pub. L. 104–132][/us/pl/104/132], see [section 329 of Pub. L. 104–132][/us/pl/104/132/s329], set out as a note under [section 2349aa–10 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2349aa–10].
