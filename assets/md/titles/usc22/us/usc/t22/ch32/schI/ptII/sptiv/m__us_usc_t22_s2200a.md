        (2)

         a description of any project for which the Corporation—

            (A) refused to provide any insurance, reinsurance, guaranty, financing, or other financial support, on account of violations of human rights referred to in [section 2199(i) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2199/i]; or

            (B) notwithstanding such violations, provided such insurance, reinsurance, guaranty, financing, or financial support, on the basis of a determination (i) that the project will directly benefit the needy people in the country in which the project is located, or (ii) that the national security interest so requires.

    (b) __Effect of all projects on employment in United States to be included in annual report__ 

        (1)

            (A) the amount of United States exports to be generated by those projects, both during the start-up phase and over a period of years;

            (B) the final destination of the products to be produced as a result of those projects; and

            (C) the impact such production will have on the production of similar products in the United States with regard to both domestic sales and exports.

        (2) The projections required by this subsection shall be based on an analysis of each of the projects described in paragraph (1).

        (3)

         In reporting the projections on employment required by this subsection, the Corporation shall specify, with respect to each project—

            (A) any loss of jobs in the United States caused by the project, whether or not the project itself creates other jobs;

            (B) any jobs created by the project; and
