([Pub. L. 104–132, title III, § 328][/us/pl/104/132/s328], Apr. 24, 1996, [110 Stat. 1257][/us/stat/110/1257].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 2349aa–4 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2349aa–4], referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original “section 575”, which was translated as meaning section 575 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Section 575 of the Act was renumbered section 574 by [section 121(d) of Pub. L. 104–164][/us/pl/104/164/s121/d] without corresponding amendment to this section.

    [Section 2350a of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2350a], referred to in subsec. (b)(2), was subsequently amended, and section 2350a(i)(3) no longer defines the term “major non-NATO ally”. However, such term is defined elsewhere in that section.

 __Codification__ 

    Section is comprised of [section 328 of Pub. L. 104–132][/us/pl/104/132/s328]. Subsec. (a) of [section 328 of Pub. L. 104–132][/us/pl/104/132/s328] amended [section 2349aa–2 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2349aa–2].

    Section was enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and not as part of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which comprises this chapter.

[Pub. L. 104–132, title III, § 329][/us/pl/104/132/s329], Apr. 24, 1996, [110 Stat. 1258][/us/stat/110/1258], provided that:
