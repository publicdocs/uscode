In such cases, the President is authorized to furnish assistance to countries and organizations, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, in order to promote economic or political stability. To the maximum extent feasible, the President shall provide assistance under this part consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of subchapter I of this chapter.

    (b) __Responsibility for policy decisions and justifications__ 

        The Secretary of State shall be responsible for policy decisions and justifications for economic support programs under this part, including determinations of whether there will be an economic support program for a country and the amount of the program for each country. The Secretary shall exercise this responsibility in cooperation with the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter.

    (c) __Detailed justification for uses and purposes of funds__ 

        As part of the annual presentation materials for foreign assistance submitted to the Congress, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter II of this chapter shall provide a detailed justification for the uses and the purposes of the funds provided under this part. Such material shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning the amounts and kinds of cash grant transfers, the amounts and kinds of budgetary and balance-of-payments support provided, and the amounts and kinds of project assistance provided with funds made available under this part.
