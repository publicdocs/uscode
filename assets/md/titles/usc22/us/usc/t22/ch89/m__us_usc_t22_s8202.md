    (5)

     to use instruments of United States influence to support, promote, and strengthen democratic principles, practices, and values, including the right to free, fair, and open elections, secret balloting, and universal suffrage, including by—

        (B) providing political, economic, and other support to foreign countries and individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and movements that are willingly undertaking a transition to democracy; and

    (6) to strengthen cooperation with other democratic countries in order to better promote and defend shared values and ideals.
