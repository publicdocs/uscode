## § 8711. Sense of Congress on enforcement of multilateral sanctions regime and expansion and implementation of sanctions laws

It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling Iran to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities can be effectively achieved through a comprehensive policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy, and military planning, capabilities and options, and that this objective is consistent with the one stated by President Barack Obama in the 2012 State of the Union Address: “Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal”. Among the economic measures to be taken are—

    (1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral sanctions regime with respect to Iran;

    (2)

     full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all sanctions enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or expanded by this Act or amendments made by this Act, through—

        (A) intensified monitoring by the President and the designees of the President, including the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and senior officials in the intelligence community (as defined in [section 401a(4) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s401a/4]), as appropriate;

        (B) more extensive use of extraordinary authorities provided for under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ([50 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t50/s1701] et seq.) and other sanctions laws;

        (C) reallocation of resources to provide the personnel necessary, within the Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce, and, where appropriate, the intelligence community, to apply and enforce sanctions; and

        (D) expanded cooperation with international sanctions enforcement efforts;

    (3)

     urgent consideration of the expansion of existing sanctions with respect to such areas as—

        (A) the provision of energy-related services to Iran;

        (B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to Iran;

        (C) the provision of shipping services to Iran; and

        (D) those Iranian financial institutions not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions that may be acting as intermediaries for Iranian financial institutions that are designated for the imposition of sanctions; and

    (4)

     a focus on countering Iran’s efforts to evade sanctions, including—

        (A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, and satellite service providers, in and outside of Iran, to ensure that such providers are not participating in or facilitating, directly or indirectly, the evasion of the sanctions regime with respect to Iran or violations of the human rights of the people of Iran;

        (B) the activities of financial institutions or other businesses or government agencies, in or outside of Iran, not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions; and

        (C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran’s energy, national security, financial, and telecommunications sectors, to gauge the effects of, and possible defects in, particular sanctions, with prompt efforts to correct any gaps in the existing sanctions regime with respect to Iran.
