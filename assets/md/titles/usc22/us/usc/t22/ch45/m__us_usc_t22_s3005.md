## § 3005. Report relating to Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe

    In order to assist the Commission in carrying out its duties, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Commission an annual report discussing the overall United States policy objectives that are advanced through meetings of decision-making bodies of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the OSCE implementation review process, and other activities of the OSCE. The report shall also include a summary of specific United States policy objectives with respect to participating states where there is particular concern relating to the implementation of OSCE commitments or where an OSCE presence exists. Such summary shall address the role played by OSCE institutions, mechanisms, or field activities in achieving United States policy objectives. Each annual report shall cover the period from January 1 to December 31, shall be submitted not more than 90 days after the end of the reporting period, and shall be posted on the Internet website of the Department of State.

([Pub. L. 94–304, § 5][/us/pl/94/304/s5], June 3, 1976, [90 Stat. 661][/us/stat/90/661]; [Pub. L. 102–138, title I, § 171][/us/pl/102/138/s171], Oct. 28, 1991, [105 Stat. 679][/us/stat/105/679]; [Pub. L. 107–228, div. A, title II, § 226][/us/pl/107/228/s226], Sept. 30, 2002, [116 Stat. 1369][/us/stat/116/1369].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—[Pub. L. 107–228][/us/pl/107/228] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “In order to assist the Commission in carrying out its duties, the President shall submit to the Commission an annual report,, which shall include (1) a detailed survey of actions by the signatories of the Final Act reflecting compliance with or violation of the provisions of the Final Act, and (2) a listing and description of present or planned programs and activities of the appropriate agencies of the executive branch and private organizations aimed at taking advantage of the provisions of the Final Act to expand East-West economic cooperation and to promote a greater interchange of people and ideas between East and West.”

    1991—[Pub. L. 102–138, § 171(2)][/us/pl/102/138/s171/2], which directed the striking out of “the first one to be submitted six months after June 3, 1976” after “report”, was executed by striking that language after “report,” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    [Pub. L. 102–138, § 171(1)][/us/pl/102/138/s171/1], substituted “an annual report” for “a semiannual report”.
