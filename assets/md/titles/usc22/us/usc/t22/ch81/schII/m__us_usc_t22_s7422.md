        (2)

         determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the International Criminal Court has entered into a binding agreement that—

             prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with respect to actions undertaken by them in an official capacity:

                (i) covered United States persons;

                (ii) covered allied persons; and

                (iii) individuals who were covered United States persons or covered allied persons; and

            (B) ensures that no person described in subparagraph (A) will be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court.

        (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of the intention to exercise such authority; and

        (2)

            (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for the International Criminal Court’s investigation or prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and

            (D)

             in investigating events related to actions by the named individual, none of the following persons will be investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with respect to actions undertaken by them in an official capacity:

                (i) Covered United States persons.

                (ii) Covered allied persons.

                (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or covered allied persons.

    (d) __Termination of waiver pursuant to subsection (c)__ 

        Any waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections 7423 and 7425 of this title shall terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of [section 7424 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7424] expires and is not extended pursuant to subsection (b).

    (e) __Termination of prohibitions of this subchapter__
