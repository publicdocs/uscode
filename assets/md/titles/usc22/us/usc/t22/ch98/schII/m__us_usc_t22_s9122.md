## § 9122. Actions by the Secretary of State in response to patterns of noncompliance in cases of international child abductions

    (a) __Response to a pattern of noncompliance__ 

    It is the policy of the United States—

        (1) to oppose institutional or other systemic failures of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the Hague Abduction Convention or bilateral procedures, as applicable, to resolve abduction and access cases;

        (2) to promote reciprocity pursuant to, and in compliance with, the Hague Abduction Convention or bilateral procedures, as appropriate; and

        (3) to directly engage with senior foreign government officials to most effectively address patterns of noncompliance.

    (b) __Determination of countries with patterns of noncompliance in cases of international child abduction__ 

        (1) __Annual review__ 

        Not later than April 30 of each year, the Secretary of State shall—

            (A) review the status of abduction and access cases in each foreign country in order to determine whether the government of such country has engaged in a pattern of noncompliance during the preceding 12 months; and

            (B) report such determination pursuant to [section 9111(f) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s9111/f].

        (2) __Determinations of responsible parties__ 

        The Secretary of State shall seek to determine the agencies or instrumentalities of the government of each country determined to have engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under paragraph (1)(A) that are responsible for such pattern of noncompliance—

            (A) to appropriately target actions in response to such noncompliance; and

            (B) to engage with senior foreign government officials to effectively address such noncompliance.

    (c) __Actions by the Secretary of State with respect to a country with a pattern of noncompliance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 90 days (or 180 days in case of a delay under paragraph (2)) after a country is determined to have been engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under subsection (b)(1)(A), the Secretary of State shall—

            (A) take 1 or more of the actions described in subsection (d);

            (B) direct the Chief of Mission in that country to directly address the systemic problems that led to such determination; and

            (C) inform senior officials in the foreign government of the potential repercussions related to such designation.

        (2) __Authority for delay of actions by the Secretary of State__ 

        The Secretary shall not be required to take action under paragraph (1) until the expiration of a single, additional period of up to 90 days if, on or before the date on which the Secretary of State is required to take such action, the Secretary determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that such additional period is necessary—

            (A) for a continuation of negotiations that have been commenced with the government of a country described in paragraph (1) in order to bring about a cessation of the pattern of noncompliance by such country;

            (B) for a review of corrective action taken by a country after the designation of such country as being engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under subsection (b)(1)(A); or

            (C) in anticipation that corrective action will be taken by such country during such 90-day period.

        (3) __Exception for additional action by the Secretary of State__ 

        The Secretary of State shall not be required to take additional action under paragraph (1) with respect to a country determined to have been engaged in a persistent pattern of noncompliance if the Secretary—

            (A) has taken action pursuant to paragraph (5), (6), or (7) of subsection (d) with respect to such country in the preceding year and such action continues to be in effect;

            (B) exercises the waiver under [section 9124 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s9124] and briefs the appropriate congressional committees; or

            (C)

             submits a report to the appropriate congressional committees that—

                (i) indicates that such country is subject to multiple, broad-based sanctions; and

                (ii) describes how such sanctions satisfy the requirements under this subsection.

        (4) __Report to Congress__ 

            Not later than 90 days after the submission of the Annual Report, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the specific actions taken against countries determined to have been engaged in a pattern of noncompliance under this section.

        (4) a delay or cancellation of 1 or more bilateral working, official, or state visits;

        (8) a formal request to the foreign country concerned to extradite an individual who is engaged in abduction and who has been formally accused of, charged with, or convicted of an extraditable offense.

    (e) __Commensurate action__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (f), the Secretary of State may substitute any other action authorized by law for any action described in subsection (d) if the Secretary determines that such action—

            (A) is commensurate in effect to the action substituted; and

            (B) would substantially further the purposes of this chapter.
