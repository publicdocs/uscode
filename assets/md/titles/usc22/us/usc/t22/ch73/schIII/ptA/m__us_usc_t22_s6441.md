            (B) __Requirement of Presidential action__ 

                For each foreign country the government of which engages in or tolerates violations of religious freedom, the President shall oppose such violations and promote the right to freedom of religion in that country through the actions described in subsection (b).

        (2) __Basis of actions__ 

            Each action taken under paragraph (1)(B) shall be based upon information regarding violations of religious freedom, as described in the latest Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Annual Report and Executive Summary, and on any other evidence available, and shall take into account any findings or recommendations by the Commission with respect to the foreign country.

    (b) __Presidential actions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the President, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Ambassador at Large, the Special Adviser, and the Commission, shall, as expeditiously as practicable in response to the violations described in subsection (a) by the government of a foreign country—

            (A) take one or more of the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (15) of [section 6445(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6445/a] (or commensurate action in substitution thereto) with respect to such country; or

    (c) __Implementation__
