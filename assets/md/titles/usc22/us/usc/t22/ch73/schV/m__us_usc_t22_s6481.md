## § 6481. Business codes of conduct

    (a) __Congressional finding__ 

        Congress recognizes the increasing importance of transnational corporations as global actors, and their potential for providing positive leadership in their host countries in the area of human rights.

    (b) __Sense of Congress__ 

    It is the sense of the Congress that transnational corporations operating overseas, particularly those corporations operating in countries the governments of which have engaged in or tolerated violations of religious freedom, as identified in the Annual Report, should adopt codes of conduct—

        (1) upholding the right to freedom of religion of their employees; and

        (2) ensuring that a worker’s religious views and peaceful practices of belief in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, the status or terms of his or her employment.
