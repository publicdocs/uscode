## § 6443. Consultations

    (a) __In general__ 

        As soon as practicable after the President decides to take action under [section 6441 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6441] in response to violations of religious freedom and the President decides to take action under paragraphs (9) through (15) of [section 6445(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6445/a] (or commensurate action in substitution thereto) with respect to that country, or not later than 90 days after the President designates a country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under [section 6442 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6442], as the case may be, the President shall carry out the consultations required in this section.

    (b) __Duty to consult with foreign governments prior to taking Presidential actions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The President shall—

            (A) request consultation with the government of such country regarding the violations giving rise to designation of that country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom or to Presidential action under [section 6441 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6441]; and

            (B) if agreed to, enter into such consultations, privately or publicly.

        (2) __Use of multilateral fora__

        (3) __Election of nondisclosure of negotiations to public__ 

            If negotiations are undertaken or an agreement is concluded with a foreign government regarding steps to cease the pattern of violations by that government, and if public disclosure of such negotiations or agreement would jeopardize the negotiations or the implementation of such agreement, as the case may be, the President may refrain from disclosing such negotiations and such agreement to the public, except that the President shall inform the appropriate congressional committees of the nature and extent of such negotiations and any agreement reached.

    (c) __Duty to consult with humanitarian organizations__ 

        The President should consult with appropriate humanitarian and religious organizations concerning the potential impact of United States policies to promote freedom of religion in countries described in subsection (a).

    (d) __Duty to consult with United States interested parties__
