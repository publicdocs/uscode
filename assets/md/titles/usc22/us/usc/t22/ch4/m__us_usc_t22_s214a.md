## § 214a. Fees erroneously charged and paid; refund

    Whenever a fee is erroneously charged and paid for the issue of a passport to a person who is exempted from the payment of such a fee by [section 214 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s214], the Department of State is authorized to refund to the person who paid such fee the amount thereof, and the money for that purpose is authorized to be appropriated.

([July 3, 1926, ch. 772, § 3][/us/act/1926-07-03/ch772/s3], [44 Stat. 887][/us/stat/44/887].)

 __Certain Appropriation Accounts Abolished__ 

    Effective July 1, 1935, enumerated appropriation accounts appearing on the books of the Government were abolished and in lieu thereof there was established an account to be designated “Refund of Moneys Erroneously Received and Covered.” See [section 1322 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1322], Money and Finance.
