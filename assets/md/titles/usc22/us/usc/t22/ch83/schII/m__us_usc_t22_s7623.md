## § 7623. Combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria by strengthening health policies and health systems of partner countries

    (a) __Statement of policy__ 

    It shall be the policy of the United States Government—

        (1)

         to invest appropriate resources authorized under this chapter—

            (A) to carry out activities to strengthen HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria health policies and health systems; and

            (B) to provide workforce training and capacity-building consistent with the goals and objectives of this chapter; and

        (2)

         to support the development of a sound policy environment in partner countries to increase the ability of such countries—

            (A) to maximize utilization of health care resources from donor countries;

            (B) to increase national investments in health and education and maximize the effectiveness of such investments;

            (C) to improve national HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria strategies;

            (D) to deliver evidence-based services in an effective and efficient manner; and

            (E) to reduce barriers that prevent recipients of services from achieving maximum benefit from such services.

    (b) __Assistance to improve public finance management systems__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Consistent with the authority under [section 2151aa of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151aa], the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the head of the Office of Technical Assistance, is authorized to provide assistance for advisors and partner country finance, health, and other relevant ministries to improve the effectiveness of public finance management systems in partner countries to enable such countries to receive funding to carry out programs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and to manage such programs.

        (2) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

            Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under [section 7671 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7671] for HIV/AIDS assistance, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out this subsection.

    (c) __Plan required__ 

        The Global AIDS Coordinator, in collaboration with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), shall develop and implement a plan to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health policies and health systems of partner countries as part of USAID’s “Health Systems 2020” project. Recognizing that human and institutional capacity form the core of any health care system that can sustain the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, the plan shall include a strategy to encourage postsecondary educational institutions in partner countries, particularly in Africa, in collaboration with United States postsecondary educational institutions, including historically black colleges and universities, to develop such human and institutional capacity and in the process further build their capacity to sustain the fight against these diseases.
