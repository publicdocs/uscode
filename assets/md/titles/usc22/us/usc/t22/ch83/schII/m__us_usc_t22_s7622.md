## § 7622. Participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria

    (a) __Findings; sense of Congress__ 

        (1) __Findings__ 

        Congress makes the following findings:

            (A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 ([Public Law 106–264][/us/pl/106/264]) \[[22 U.S.C. 6801][/us/usc/t22/s6801] et seq.\].

            (B)

             The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which—

                (i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and

                (ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.

            (C)

             The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs—

                (i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and

                (ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.

            (D)

             The United States Government—

                (i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;

                (ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and

                (iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.

        (2) __Sense of Congress__ 

        It is the sense of Congress that—

            (A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;

            (B)

             the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by—

                (i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;

                (ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and

                (iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;

            (C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;

            (D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;

            (E)

             the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track—

                (i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant’s fiscal cycle; and

                (ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;

            (F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;

            (G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;

            (H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and

            (I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the “Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria” or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.

    (b) __Authority for United States participation__ 

        (1) __United States participation__ 

            The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.

        (2) __Privileges and immunities__ 

            The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of [section 288 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s288].

        (3) __Statement of policy__ 

            The United States Government regards the imposition by recipient countries of taxes or tariffs on goods or services provided by the Global Fund, which are supported through public and private donations, including the substantial contribution of the American people, as inappropriate and inconsistent with standards of good governance. The Global AIDS Coordinator or other representatives of the United States Government shall work with the Global Fund to dissuade governments from imposing such duties, tariffs, or taxes.

    (c) __Reports to Congress__ 

        Not later than 1 year after May 27, 2003, and annually thereafter for the duration of the Global Fund, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions (including donations from the private sector) received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and the mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process.

    (d) __United States financial participation__ 

        (1) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

            In addition to any other funds authorized to be appropriated for bilateral or multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria programs, of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under [section 7671 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7671], there are authorized to be appropriated to the President up to $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2009,, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2013, for contributions to the Global Fund.

                (ii) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2009 through 2018, the President determines that the Global Fund has provided assistance to a country, the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of [section 4605(j)(1) of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s4605/j/1], has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the amount expended by the Fund to the government of each such country.

                (iii) If at any time the President determines that the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies (including the Partnership Forum, the Foundation Board, the Secretariat, and the Technical Review Board) of the Global Fund exceed 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund for any 2-year period, the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal the to the average annual amount expended by the Fund for such 2-year period for the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies in excess of 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund.

                (v) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the President determines that the salary of any individual employed by the Global Fund exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States (as determined under [section 104 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s104]) for that fiscal year, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which the salary of each such individual exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States.

                (vi) For the purposes of clause (i), “funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources” means funds contributed to the Global Fund at any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2018 that are not contributed to fulfill a commitment made for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2009.

            (B)

                (i) Any amount made available that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be contributed to the Global Fund as soon as practicable, subject to subparagraph (A)(i), after additional contributions to the Global Fund are made from other sources.

                (ii) Any amount made available that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be transferred to the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund and shall remain available under the same terms and conditions as funds appropriated to carry out [section 2151b–2 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151b–2] for HIV/AIDS assistance.

                (iii) Any amount made available that is withheld by reason of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) is authorized to be made available to carry out [section 2151b–2 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151b–2]. Amounts made available under the preceding sentence are in addition to amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under [section 7671 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7671] for HIV/AIDS assistance.

                (iv) Notwithstanding clause (i), after July 31 of each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2018, any amount made available that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) is authorized to be made available to carry out sections 2151b–2, 2151b–3, and 2151b–4 of this title.

            (C)

                (i) The President may suspend the application of subparagraph (A) with respect to a fiscal year if the President determines that an international health emergency threatens the national security interests of the United States.

                (ii)

                 The President shall notify the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate not less than 5 days before making a determination under clause (i) with respect to the application of subparagraph (A)(i) and shall include in the notification—

                    (I) a justification as to why increased United States Government contributions to the Global Fund is preferable to increased United States assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on a bilateral basis; and

                    (II) an explanation as to why other government donors to the Global Fund are unable to provide adequate contributions to the Fund.

        (5) __Withholding funds__
