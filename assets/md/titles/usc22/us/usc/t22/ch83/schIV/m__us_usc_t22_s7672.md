## § 7672. Sense of Congress

    (a) __Increase in HIV/AIDS antiretroviral treatment__ 

    It is a sense of the Congress that an urgent priority of United States assistance programs to fight HIV/AIDS should be the rapid increase in distribution of antiretroviral treatment so that—

        (1) by the end of fiscal year 2004, at least 500,000 individuals with HIV/AIDS are receiving antiretroviral treatment through United States assistance programs;

        (2) by the end of fiscal year 2005, at least 1,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment; and

        (3) by the end of fiscal year 2006, at least 2,000,000 such individuals are receiving such treatment.

    (b) __Effective distribution of HIV/AIDS funds__ 

        It is the sense of Congress that, of the amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under [section 7671 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s7671] for HIV/AIDS assistance, 10 percent should be used for orphans and vulnerable children.

([Pub. L. 108–25, title IV, § 402][/us/pl/108/25/s402], May 27, 2003, [117 Stat. 745][/us/stat/117/745]; [Pub. L. 110–293, title IV, § 402][/us/pl/110/293/s402], July 30, 2008, [122 Stat. 2966][/us/stat/122/2966].)

 __Amendments__ 

    2008—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 110–293][/us/pl/110/293] substituted “10 percent should be used” for “an effective distribution of such amounts would be—

    “(1) 55 percent of such amounts for treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS;

    “(2) 15 percent of such amounts for palliative care of individuals with HIV/AIDS;

    “(3) 20 percent of such amounts for HIV/AIDS prevention consistent with [section 2151b–2(d) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151b–2/d], of which such amount at least 33 percent should be expended for abstinence-until-marriage programs; and

    “(4) 10 percent of such amounts”.
