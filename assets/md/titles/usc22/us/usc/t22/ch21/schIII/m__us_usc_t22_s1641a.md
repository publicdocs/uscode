        There are created in the Treasury of the United States five funds to be known as the Bulgarian Claims Fund, the Hungarian Claims Fund, the Rumanian Claims Fund, the Italian Claims Fund, and the Soviet Claims Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall cover into each of the Hungarian, Rumanian, and Bulgarian Claims Funds, the funds attributable to the respective country or its nationals covered into the Treasury pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of [section 1631a of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1631a].

The Secretary shall cover into the Treasury the funds collected by the United States pursuant to the Litvinov Assignment (including postal funds due prior to November 16, 1933, to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics because of money orders certified to that country for payment) and shall cover into the Soviet Claims Fund the funds so covered into the Treasury. The Secretary shall deduct from each claims fund 5 per centum thereof as reimbursement to the Government of the United States for the expenses incurred by the Commission and by the Treasury Department in the administration of this subchapter. Such deduction shall be made before any payment is made out of such fund under [section 1641i of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1641i].
