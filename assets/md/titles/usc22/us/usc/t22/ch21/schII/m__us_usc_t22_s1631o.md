    (b) __Notice of claim; time of claim; fund for payment__ 

        An interest in property vested under the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, as the property of a corporation organized under the laws of Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania shall be subject to return under subsection (a) of this section only if a notice of claim for the return of any such interest has been timely filed under the provisions of [section 4330 of Title 50][/us/usc/t50/s4330], provided that application may be made therefore within six months after July 24, 1968.
