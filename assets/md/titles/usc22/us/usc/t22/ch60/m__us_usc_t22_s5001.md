 __Repeal of Chapter; South African Democratic Transition Support__ 

[Pub. L. 103–149][/us/pl/103/149], Nov. 23, 1993, [107 Stat. 1503][/us/stat/107/1503], provided that:

> “SECTION 1. __SHORT TITLE.__ 

>     “This Act may be cited as the ‘South African Democratic Transition Support Act of 1993’.

> “SEC. 2. __FINDINGS.__ 

> “The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) After decades of apartheid, South Africa has entered a new era which presents a historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful, stable, and democratic future.

>     “(2) The United States policy of economic sanctions toward the apartheid government of South Africa, as expressed in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 \[[22 U.S.C. 5001][/us/usc/t22/s5001] et seq.\], helped bring about reforms in that system of government and has facilitated the establishment of a nonracial government.

>     “(3) Through broad and open negotiations, the parties in South Africa have reached a landmark agreement on the future of their country. This agreement includes the establishment of a Transitional Executive Council and the setting of a date for nonracial elections.

>     “(4) The international community has a vital interest in supporting the transition from apartheid toward nonracial democracy.

>     “(5) The success of the transition in South Africa is crucial to the stability and economic development of the southern African region.

>     “(6) Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and other representative leaders in South Africa have declared that the time has come when the international community should lift all economic sanctions against South Africa.

>     “(7) In light of recent developments, the continuation of these economic sanctions is detrimental to persons disadvantaged by apartheid.

>     “(8) Those calling for the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa have made clear that they do not seek the immediate termination of the United Nations-sponsored special sanctions relating to arms transfers, nuclear cooperation, and exports of oil. The Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity, for example, has urged that the oil embargo established pursuant to a 1986 General Assembly resolution be lifted after the establishment and commencement of the work of the Transitional Executive Council.

> “SEC. 3. __UNITED STATES POLICY.__ 

> “It is the sense of the Congress that—

>     “(1)

>      the United States should—

>         “(A) strongly support the Transitional Executive Council in South Africa,

>         “(B) encourage rapid progress toward the establishment of a nonracial democratic government in South Africa, and

>         “(C) support a consolidation of democracy in South Africa through democratic elections for an interim government and a new nonracial constitution;

>     “(2) the United States should continue to provide assistance to support the transition to a nonracial democracy in South Africa, and should urge international financial institutions and other donors to also provide such assistance;

>     “(3) to the maximum extent practicable, the United States should consult closely with international financial institutions, other donors, and South African entities on a coordinated strategy to support the transition to a nonracial democracy in South Africa;

>     “(4)

>      in order to provide ownership and managerial opportunities, professional advancement, training, and employment for disadvantaged South Africans and to respond to the historical inequities created under apartheid, the United States should—

>         “(A) promote the expansion of private enterprise and free markets in South Africa,

>         “(B) encourage the South African private sector to take a special responsibility and interest in providing such opportunities, advancement, training, and employment for disadvantaged South Africans,

>         “(C) encourage United States private sector investment in and trade with South Africa,

>         “(D) urge United States investors to develop a working partnership with representative organs of South African civil society, particularly churches and trade unions, in promoting responsible codes of corporate conduct and other measures to address the historical inequities created under apartheid;

>     “(5) the United States should urge the Government of South Africa to liberalize its trade and investment policies to facilitate the expansion of the economy, and to shift resources to meet the needs of disadvantaged South Africans;

>     “(6) the United States should promote cooperation between South Africa and other countries in the region to foster regional stability and economic growth; and

>     “(7) the United States should demonstrate its support for an expedited transition to, and should adopt a long term policy beneficial to the establishment and perpetuation of, a nonracial democracy in South Africa.
