## § 6083. Proof of ownership of claims to confiscated property

    (a) __Evidence of ownership__ 

        (1) __Conclusiveness of certified claims__ 

            In any action brought under this subchapter, the court shall accept as conclusive proof of ownership of an interest in property a certification of a claim to ownership of that interest that has been made by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 ([22 U.S.C. 1643][/us/usc/t22/s1643] and following).

        (2) __Claims not certified__ 

            If in an action under this subchapter a claim has not been so certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the court may appoint a special master, including the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to make determinations regarding the amount and ownership of the claim. Such determinations are only for evidentiary purposes in civil actions brought under this subchapter and do not constitute certifications under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949.

        (3) __Effect of determinations of foreign or international entities__ 

            In determining the amount or ownership of a claim in an action under this subchapter, the court shall not accept as conclusive evidence any findings, orders, judgments, or decrees from administrative agencies or courts of foreign countries or international organizations that declare the value of or invalidate the claim, unless the declaration of value or invalidation was found pursuant to binding international arbitration to which the United States or the claimant submitted the claim.

    (b) __Omitted__ 

    (c) __Rule of construction__ 

    Nothing in this chapter or in section 514 of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 \[[22 U.S.C. 1643][/us/usc/t22/s1643]l\], as added by subsection (b) of this section, shall be construed—

        (1) to require or otherwise authorize the claims of Cuban nationals who became United States citizens after their property was confiscated to be included in the claims certified to the Secretary of State by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for purposes of future negotiation and espousal of claims with a friendly government in Cuba when diplomatic relations are restored; or

        (2) as superseding, amending, or otherwise altering certifications that have been made under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 \[[22 U.S.C. 1643][/us/usc/t22/s1643] et seq.\] before March 12, 1996.
