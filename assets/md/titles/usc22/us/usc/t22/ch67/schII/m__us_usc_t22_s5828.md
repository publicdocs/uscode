## § 5828. Funding for OPIC programs

    (a) __Authority to make additional funds available__ 

        Funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1993 to carry out chapter 11 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \[[22 U.S.C. 2295][/us/usc/t22/s2295] et seq.\] may be made available to cover costs incurred by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in carrying out programs with respect to the independent states of the former Soviet Union under title IV of chapter 2 of part I of that Act ([22 U.S.C. 2191][/us/usc/t22/s2191] and following), in addition to amounts otherwise available for that purpose.

    (b) __Enactment of OPIC Authorization Act__ 

        The authority of subsection (a) of this section shall cease to be effective upon the enactment of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Act Amendments Act of 1992.

([Pub. L. 102–511, title III, § 308][/us/pl/102/511/s308], Oct. 24, 1992, [106 Stat. 3335][/us/stat/106/3335].)

 __References in Text__ 

    The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, referred to in subsec. (a), is [Pub. L. 87–195][/us/pl/87/195], Sept. 4, 1961, [75 Stat. 424][/us/stat/75/424], as amended. Chapter 11 of part I of the Act is classified generally to part II (§ 2295 et seq.) of subchapter I of chapter 32 of this title. Title IV of chapter 2 of part I of the Act is classified generally to subpart IV (§ 2191 et seq.) of part II of subchapter I of chapter 32 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 2151 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151] and Tables.

    The Overseas Private Investment Corporation Act Amendments Act of 1992, referred to in subsec. (b), probably means the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Amendments Act of 1992, which was title I of H.R. 4996, 102d Congress, as passed by the House of Representatives. H.R. 4996 was enacted into law as [Pub. L. 102–549][/us/pl/102/549] and title I was significantly revised and no longer contained provisions designating it as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Amendments Act of 1992.
