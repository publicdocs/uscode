## § 5851. Findings

    The Congress finds that it is in the national security interest of the United States—

    (1)

     to facilitate, on a priority basis—

        (A) the transportation, storage, safeguarding, and destruction of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction of the independent states of the former Soviet Union;

        (B) the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing conventional weapons of the independent states, and the establishment of verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of such weapons;

        (C) the prevention of diversion of weapons-related scientific expertise of the former Soviet Union to terrorist groups or third countries; and

        (D) other efforts designed to reduce the military threat from the former Soviet Union;

    (2) to support the conversion of the massive defense-related industry and equipment of the independent states of the former Soviet Union for civilian purposes and uses; and

    (3) to expand military-to-military contacts between the United States and the independent states.
