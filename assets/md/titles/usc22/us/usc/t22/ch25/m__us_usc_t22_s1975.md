## § 1975. Claims for amounts expended because of seizure

    (a) __Action by Secretary__ 

    The Secretary of State shall—

        (1)

         immediately notify a foreign country of—

            (A) any reimbursement made by him under [section 1973 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1973] as a result of the seizure of a vessel of the United States by such country,

            (B) any payment made pursuant to [section 1977 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1977] in connection with such seizure, and

        (2) take such action as he deems appropriate to make and collect claims against such foreign country for the amounts so reimbursed and payments so made.

    (b) __Withholding amount of unpaid claim from foreign assistance funds__ 

        If a foreign country fails or refuses to make payment in full on any claim made under subsection (a)(2) of this section within one hundred and twenty days after the date on which such country is notified pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of State shall transfer an amount equal to such unpaid claim or unpaid portion thereof from any funds appropriated by Congress and programed for the current fiscal year for assistance to the government of such country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \[[22 U.S.C. 2151][/us/usc/t22/s2151] et seq.\] unless the President certifies to the Congress that it is in the national interest not to do so in the particular instance (and if such funds are insufficient to cover such claim, transfer shall be made from any funds so appropriated and programed for the next and any succeeding fiscal year) to (1) the Fishermen’s Protective Fund established pursuant to [section 1979 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1979] if the amount is transferred with respect to an unpaid claim for a reimbursement made under [section 1973 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1973], or (2) the separate account established in the Treasury of the United States pursuant to [section 1977(c) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1977/c] if the amount is transferred with respect to an unpaid claim for a payment made under [section 1977(a) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1977/a]. Amounts transferred under this section shall not constitute satisfaction of any such claim of the United States against such foreign country.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, referred to in subsec. (b), is [Pub. L. 87–195][/us/pl/87/195], Sept. 4, 1961, [75 Stat. 424][/us/stat/75/424], as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 32 (§ 2151 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 2151 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2151] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1984—Subsec. (a)(1)(A). [Pub. L. 98–364][/us/pl/98/364] substituted “him” for “the Secretary of the Treasury”.

    1972—[Pub. L. 92–569][/us/pl/92/569] substituted provisions that the Secretary of State notify the foreign country of reimbursements made under [section 1973 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1973] and payments made under [section 1977 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1977], take appropriate action to make and collect claims against such foreign country and on failure to receive payment or on refusal to pay within 120 days after the notification, transfer an amount equal to the unpaid amount from funds programmed for assistance to that country to the Fishermen’s Protective Fund or the separate account in the Treasury as the case may be, and in the case of inadequate funds programmed in the current fiscal year make the deduction from succeeding fiscal years, with exception that no such transfer be made when the President certifies to Congress that it is in the national interest not to do so, for provisions that the Secretary of State take appropriate action to collect claims against such foreign country and withhold amounts equal to the unpaid claims from the foreign assistance programmed for that fiscal year when such country fails or refuses to pay within 120 days of receipt of notice of claim.

    1968—[Pub. L. 90–482][/us/pl/90/482] inserted provisions authorizing the Secretary to act when payments are made pursuant to [section 1977 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s1977], and provisions authorizing the Secretary to withhold the amount of any unpaid claim against the foreign country from the foreign assistance funds programed for that country, such amounts withheld not to constitute satisfaction of any unpaid claim.
