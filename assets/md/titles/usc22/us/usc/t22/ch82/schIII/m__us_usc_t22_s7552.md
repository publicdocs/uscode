## § 7552. Sense of Congress regarding protecting Afghanistan’s President

    It is the sense of Congress that—

    (1) any United States physical protection force provided for the personal security of the President of Afghanistan should be composed of United States diplomatic security, law-enforcement, or military personnel, and should not utilize private contracted personnel to provide actual physical protection services;

    (2) United States allies should be invited to volunteer active-duty military or law enforcement personnel to participate in such a protection force; and

    (3) such a protection force should be limited in duration and should be succeeded by qualified Afghan security forces as soon as practicable.
