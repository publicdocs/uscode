## § 1461–1a. Clarification on domestic distribution of program material

    (a) __In general__ 

        No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States. This section shall apply only to programs carried out pursuant to the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 ([22 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t22/s1431] et seq.), the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 ([22 U.S.C. 6201][/us/usc/t22/s6201] et seq.), the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act ([22 U.S.C. 1465][/us/usc/t22/s1465] et seq.), and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act ([22 U.S.C. 1465aa][/us/usc/t22/s1465aa] et seq.). This section shall not prohibit or delay the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from providing information about its operations, policies, programs, or program material, or making such available, to the media, public, or Congress, in accordance with other applicable law.

    (b) __Rule of construction__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure. Such material may be made available within the United States and disseminated, when appropriate, pursuant to sections 502 and 1005 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 ([22 U.S.C. 1462][/us/usc/t22/s1462] and 1437), except that nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors to disseminate within the United States any program material prepared for dissemination abroad on or before the effective date of section 1078 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.

    (c) __Application__ 

        The provisions of this section shall apply only to the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors and to no other department or agency of the Federal Government.
