 __Repeal of Section__ 

Section repealed upon transmittal of determination by President under [section 6063(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6063/c/3] that democratically elected government in Cuba is in power, see [section 6037(c) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6037/c].

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 153 of title 47][/us/usc/t47/s153], referred to in pars. (1) and (2), was subsequently amended, and section 153(c) no longer defines “licensee”. However, such term is defined elsewhere in that section.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act which comprises this subchapter, and not as part of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 which comprises this chapter.

 __Change of Name__ 

    Committee on Energy and Commerce of House of Representatives treated as referring to Committee on Commerce of House of Representatives by [section 1(a) of Pub.
