## § 1465aa. Findings and purposes

The Congress finds and declares that—

    (1) it is the policy of the United States to support the right of the people of Cuba to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers, in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

    (2) consonant with this policy, television broadcasting to Cuba may be effective in furthering the open communication of accurate information and ideas to the people of Cuba and, in particular, information about Cuba;

    (3) television broadcasting to Cuba, operated in a manner not inconsistent with the broad foreign policy of the United States and in accordance with high professional standards, would be in the national interest;

    (4) facilities broadcasting television programming to Cuba must be operated in a manner consistent with applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and must not affect the quality of domestic broadcast transmission or reception; and

    (5) that  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The word “that” probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  the Voice of America already broadcasts to Cuba information that represents America, not any single segment of American society, and includes a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions, but that there is a need for television broadcasts to Cuba which provide news, commentary, and other information about events in Cuba and elsewhere to promote the cause of freedom in Cuba.

([Pub. L. 101–246, title II, § 242][/us/pl/101/246/s242], Feb. 16, 1990, [104 Stat. 58][/us/stat/104/58].)

> “This part \[part D (§§ 241–248) of title II of [Pub.
