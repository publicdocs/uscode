## § 7816. Establishment of regional framework

    (a) __Findings__ 

        The Congress finds that human rights initiatives can be undertaken on a multilateral basis, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which established a regional framework for discussing human rights, scientific and educational cooperation, and economic and trade issues.

    (b) __Sense of Congress__ 

        It is the sense of Congress that the United Sates  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “States”. </sup></sup>  should explore the possibility of a regional human rights dialogue with North Korea that is modeled on the Helsinki process, engaging all countries in the region in a common commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.
