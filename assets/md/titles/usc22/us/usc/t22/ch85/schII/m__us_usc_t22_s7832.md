## § 7832. Assistance provided inside North Korea

    (a) __Humanitarian assistance through nongovernmental and international organizations__ 

    It is the sense of the Congress that—

        (1) at the same time that Congress supports the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of North Korea on humanitarian grounds, such assistance also should be provided and monitored so as to minimize the possibility that such assistance could be diverted to political or military use, and to maximize the likelihood that it will reach the most vulnerable North Koreans;

        (2) significant increases above current levels of United States support for humanitarian assistance provided inside North Korea should be conditioned upon substantial improvements in transparency, monitoring, and access to vulnerable populations throughout North Korea; and

        (3) the United States should encourage other countries that provide food and other humanitarian assistance to North Korea to do so through monitored, transparent channels, rather than through direct, bilateral transfers to the Government of North Korea.

    (b) __United States assistance to the government of North Korea__ 

    It is the sense of Congress that—

        (1)

         United States humanitarian assistance to any department, agency, or entity of the Government of North Korea shall—

            (A) be delivered, distributed, and monitored according to internationally recognized humanitarian standards;

            (B) be provided on a needs basis, and not used as a political reward or tool of coercion;

            (C) reach the intended beneficiaries, who should be informed of the source of the assistance; and

            (D) be made available to all vulnerable groups in North Korea, no matter where in the country they may be located; and

        (2)

         United States nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea shall be contingent on North Korea’s substantial progress toward—

            (A) respect for the basic human rights of the people of North Korea, including freedom of religion;

            (B) providing for family reunification between North Koreans and their descendants and relatives in the United States;

            (C) fully disclosing all information regarding citizens of Japan and the Republic of Korea abducted by the Government of North Korea;

            (D) allowing such abductees, along with their families, complete and genuine freedom to leave North Korea and return to the abductees’ original home countries;

            (E) reforming the North Korean prison and labor camp system, and subjecting such reforms to independent international monitoring; and

            (F) decriminalizing political expression and activity.

    (c) __Report__ 

        Not later than 180 days after October 18, 2004, the Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report describing compliance with this section.
