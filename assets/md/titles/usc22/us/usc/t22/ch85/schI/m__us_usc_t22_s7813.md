## § 7813. Radio broadcasting to North Korea

    (a) __Sense of Congress__ 

        It is the sense of Congress that the United States should facilitate the unhindered dissemination of information in North Korea by increasing its support for radio broadcasting to North Korea, and that the Broadcasting Board of Governors should increase broadcasts to North Korea from current levels, with a goal of providing 12-hour-per-day broadcasting to North Korea, including broadcasts by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.

    (b) __Report__ 

    Not later than 120 days after October 18, 2004, the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that—

        (1) describes the status of current United States broadcasting to North Korea; and

        (2) outlines a plan for increasing such broadcasts to 12 hours per day, including a detailed description of the technical and fiscal requirements necessary to implement the plan.
