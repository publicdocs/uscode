## § 3310. Employment of United States Government agency personnel

    (a) __Separation from Government service; reemployment or reinstatement upon termination of Institute employment; benefits__ 

        (1) Under such terms and conditions as the President may direct, any agency of the United States Government may separate from Government service for a specified period any officer or employee of that agency who accepts employment with the Institute.

        (2) An officer or employee separated by an agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection for employment with the Institute shall be entitled upon termination of such employment to reemployment or reinstatement with such agency (or a successor agency) in an appropriate position with the attendant rights, privileges, and benefits with  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “which”. </sup></sup>  the officer or employee would have had or acquired had he or she not been so separated, subject to such time period and other conditions as the President may prescribe.

        (3) An officer or employee entitled to reemployment or reinstatement rights under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall, while continuously employed by the Institute with no break in continuity of service, continue to participate in any benefit program in which such officer or employee was participating prior to employment by the Institute, including programs for compensation for job-related death, injury, or illness; programs for health and life insurance; programs for annual, sick, and other statutory leave; and programs for retirement under any system established by the laws of the United States; except that employment with the Institute shall be the basis for participation in such programs only to the extent that employee deductions and employer contributions, as required, in payment for such participation for the period of employment with the Institute, are currently deposited in the program’s or system’s fund or depository. Death or retirement of any such officer or employee during approved service with the Institute and prior to reemployment or reinstatement shall be considered a death in or retirement from Government service for purposes of any employee or survivor benefits acquired by reason of service with an agency of the United States Government.

        (4) Any officer or employee of an agency of the United States Government who entered into service with the Institute on approved leave of absence without pay prior to April 10, 1979, shall receive the benefits of this section for the period of such service.

    (b) __Employment of aliens on Taiwan__ 

        Any agency of the United States Government employing alien personnel on Taiwan may transfer such personnel, with accrued allowances, benefits, and rights, to the Institute without a break in service for purposes of retirement and other benefits, including continued participation in any system established by the laws of the United States for the retirement of employees in which the alien was participating prior to the transfer to the Institute, except that employment with the Institute shall be creditable for retirement purposes only to the extent that employee deductions and employer contributions, as required, in payment for such participation for the period of employment with the Institute, are currently deposited in the system’s fund or depository.

    (c) __Institute employees not deemed United States employees__ 

        Employees of the Institute shall not be employees of the United States and, in representing the Institute, shall be exempt from [section 207 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s207].

    (d) __Tax treatment of amounts paid Institute employees__ 

        (1) For purposes of sections 911 and 913  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 26, amounts paid by the Institute to its employees shall not be treated as earned income. Amounts received by employees of the Institute shall not be included in gross income, and shall be exempt from taxation, to the extent that they are equivalent to amounts received by civilian officers and employees of the Government of the United States as allowances and benefits which are exempt from taxation under [section 912 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s912].

        (2) Except to the extent required by subsection (a)(3) of this section, service performed in the employ of the Institute shall not constitute employment for purposes of chapter 21 of title 26 and title II of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 401][/us/usc/t42/s401] et seq.\].

([Pub. L. 96–8][/us/pl/96/8], § 11, Apr. 10, 1979, [93 Stat. 18][/us/stat/93/18]; [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514], § 2, Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 913 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s913], referred to in subsec. (d)(1), was repealed by [Pub. L. 97–34, title I][/us/pl/97/34/tI], § 112(a), Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 194][/us/stat/95/194].

    Chapter 21 (§ 3101 et seq.) of title 26, referred to in subsec. (d)(2), is known as the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.

    The Social Security Act, referred to in subsec. (d)(2), is [act Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531][/us/act/1935-08-14/ch531], [49 Stat. 620][/us/stat/49/620], as amended. Title II of the Social Security Act is classified generally to subchapter II (§ 401 et seq.) of chapter 7 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see [section 1305 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1305] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Subsec. (d)(1). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

 __Ex. Ord. No. 13054. Eligibility of Certain Overseas Employees for Noncompetitive Appointments__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 13054, July 7, 1997, 62 F.R. 36965, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13062, § 6, Sept. 29, 1997, 62 F.R. 51756, provided:

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5 and [section 301 of title 3][/us/usc/t3/s301] of the United States Code, and in order to permit certain overseas employees to acquire competitive status upon returning to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1.

    Sec. 2. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.

    Sec. 3. This order shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

                              William J. Clinton.
