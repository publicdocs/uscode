## § 6304. Reporting on demarches

    (1) It is the sense of the Congress that the Department of State should, in the course of implementing its reporting responsibilities under [section 3282(c) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s3282/c], include a summary of demarches that the United States has issued or received from foreign governments with respect to activities which are of significance from the proliferation standpoint.

    (2)

     For purposes of this section, the term “demarche” means any official communication by one government to another, by written or oral means, intended by the originating government to express—

        (A) a concern over a past, present, or possible future action or activity of the recipient government, or of a person within the jurisdiction of that government, contributing to the global spread of unsafeguarded special nuclear material or of nuclear explosive devices;

        (B) a request for the recipient government to counter such action or activity; or

        (C) both the concern and request described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
