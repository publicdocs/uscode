## § 4351. General authority and contents of publication

    (a) __Charter of publication__ 

        The Department of State shall continue to publish the “Foreign Relations of the United States historical series” (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the “FRUS series”), which shall be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. Volumes of this publication shall include all records needed to provide a comprehensive documentation of the major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government, including the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies and records providing supporting and alternative views to the policy position ultimately adopted.

    (b) __Editing principles__ 

        The editing of records for preparation of the FRUS series shall be guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy. Records shall not be altered and deletions shall not be made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made. The published record shall omit no facts which were of major importance in reaching a decision, and nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing a defect of policy.

    (c) __Deadline for publication of records__ 

        The Secretary of State shall ensure that the FRUS series shall be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.
