## § 9302. Statement of policy objectives; sense of Congress

    (a) __Statement of policy objectives__ 

    It is in the national interest of the United States to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans, which is reinforced through programs, activities, and initiatives that—

        (1) place food insecure countries on a path toward self-sufficiency and economic freedom through the coordination of United States foreign assistance programs;

        (2) accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, particularly among women and children;

        (3) increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of small-scale producers, especially women, by working across agricultural value chains, enhancing local capacity to manage agricultural resources effectively and expanding producer access to local and international markets;

        (4) build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable populations and households while reducing reliance upon emergency food assistance;

        (5) create an enabling environment for agricultural growth and investment, including through the promotion of secure and transparent property rights;

        (6) improve the nutritional status of women and children, with a focus on reducing child stunting, including through the promotion of highly nutritious foods, diet diversification, and nutritional behaviors that improve maternal and child health;

        (7) demonstrably meet, align with and leverage broader United States strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, national security, science and technology, agriculture research and extension, maternal and child health, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and hygiene;

        (8) continue to strengthen partnerships between United States-based universities, including land-grant colleges, and universities and institutions in target countries and communities that build agricultural capacity; and

        (9) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer dollars to further these objectives.

    (b) __Sense of Congress__ 

    It is the sense of the Congress that the President, in providing assistance to implement the Global Food Security Strategy, should—

        (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to implement the Global Food Security Strategy;

        (2) seek to fully utilize the unique capabilities of each relevant Federal department and agency while collaborating with and leveraging the contributions of other key stakeholders; and

        (3) utilize open and streamlined solicitations to allow for the participation of a wide range of implementing partners through the most appropriate procurement mechanisms, which may include grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other instruments as necessary and appropriate.
