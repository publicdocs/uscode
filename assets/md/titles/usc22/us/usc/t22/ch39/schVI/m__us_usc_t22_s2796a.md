## § 2796a. Reports to Congress

    (a) __Written certification to Speaker of the House and chairmen of Congressional committees__ 

    Before entering into or renewing any agreement with a foreign country or international organization to lease any defense article under this subchapter, or to loan any defense article under chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \[[22 U.S.C. 2311][/us/usc/t22/s2311] et seq.\], for a period of one year or longer, the President shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, a written certification which specifies—

        (1) the country or international organization to which the defense article is to be leased or loaned;

        (2) the type, quantity, and value (in terms of replacement cost) of the defense article to be leased or loaned;

        (3) the terms and duration of the lease or loan; and

        (4) a justification for the lease or loan, including an explanation of why the defense article is being leased or loaned rather than sold under this chapter.

    (b) __Waiver; determination of emergency__ 

        The President may waive the requirements of this section (and in the case of an agreement described in [section 2796b of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2796b], may waive the provisions of that section) if he states in his certification, that an emergency exists which requires that the lease or loan be entered into immediately in the national security interests of the United States. If the President states in his certification that such an emergency exists, he shall set forth in the certification a detailed justification for his determination, including a description of the emergency circumstances which necessitate that the lease be entered into immediately and a discussion of the national security interests involved.

    (c) __Transmission of certification__ 

    The certification required by subsection (a) shall be transmitted—

        (1) not less than 15 calendar days before the agreement is entered into or renewed in the case of an agreement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, any member country of that Organization or Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Israel, or New Zealand; and

        (2) not less than 30 calendar days before the agreement is entered into or renewed in the case of an agreement with any other organization or country.
