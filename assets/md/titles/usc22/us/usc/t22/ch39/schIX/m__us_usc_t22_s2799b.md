## § 2799b. Authorities

    (a) __General authority__ 

    The President may transfer to any NATO/CFE country, in accordance with NATO plans, defense articles—

        (2) that were, as of the date of signature of the CFE Treaty, in the stocks of the Department of Defense and located in the CFE Treaty’s area of application; and

        (3) that the President determines are not needed by United States military forces within the CFE Treaty’s area of application.

    (b) __Acceptance of NATO assistance in eliminating direct costs of transfers__ 

        In order to eliminate direct costs of facilitating transfers of defense articles under subsection (a) of this section, the United States may utilize services provided by NATO or any NATO/CFE country, including inspection, repair, or transportation services with respect to defense articles so transferred.

    (c) __Acceptance of NATO assistance in meeting certain United States obligations__ 

        In order to facilitate United States compliance with the CFE Treaty-mandated obligations for destruction of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the CFE Treaty, the United States may utilize services or funds provided by NATO or any NATO/CFE country.

    (f) __Maintenance of military balance in Eastern Mediterranean__ 

        The President shall ensure that transfers by the United States under subsection (a) of this section, taken together with transfers by other NATO/CFE countries in implementing the CFE Treaty, are of such valuations so as to be consistent with the United States policy, embodied in [section 2373 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2373], of maintaining the military balance in the Eastern Mediterranean.
