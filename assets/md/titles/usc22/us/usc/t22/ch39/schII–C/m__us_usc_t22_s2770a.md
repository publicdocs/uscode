Such reciprocal training and related support must be provided within a reasonable period of time (which may not be more than one year) of the provision of training and related support by the United States. To the extent that a foreign country or international organization to which training and related support is provided under this section does not provide such comparable training and related support to the United States within a reasonable period of time, that country or international organization shall be required to reimburse the United States for the full costs of the training and related support provided by the United States.
