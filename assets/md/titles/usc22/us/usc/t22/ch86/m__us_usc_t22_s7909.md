## § 7909. Authorization for the Clean Technology Fund

    (1) __Limitations on authorization of appropriations__ 

        For fiscal year 2010, up to $300,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for a United States contribution to the Clean Technology Fund (the Fund).

    (2) __Limits on country access__ 

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall use the voice and vote of the United States to ensure that—

        (A) The Fund does not provide more than 15 percent of Fund resources to any one country;

        (B) Prior to the obligation of funds, recipient countries submit to the governing body of the Fund, and the governing body of the Fund appropriately reviews and considers, an investment plan that will achieve significant net reductions in national-level greenhouse gas emissions;

        (C) The investment plan for a recipient country, whose borrowing status is classified by the World Bank as “International Development Association (IDA) blend”, shall have at least 15 percent of its total cost for public sector activities contributed from the public funds of the recipient country, and any recipient country whose borrowing status is classified by the World Bank as “International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Only” status, shall have at least 25 percent of its total cost for public sector activities contributed from public funds of the recipient country; and

        (D) Assistance made available by the Fund is used exclusively to support the deployment of clean energy technologies in developing countries (including, where appropriate, through the provision of technical support or support for policy or institutional reforms) in a manner that achieves substantial net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

    (3) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 113–76, div. K, title VII, § 7034(i)__  __][/us/pl/113/76/s7034/i]__  __,__  __Jan. 17, 2014__  __,__  __[__  __128 Stat. 514__  __][/us/stat/128/514]__ 

    (4) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (A) __Net reductions__ 

            The term “net reductions” refers to the extent to which a project or program supported under this section results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than would be emitted by the same entity or sector in the same country in the absence of the Fund’s project, taking into account, unless impracticable, effects beyond the physical boundaries of the project or program that result from project or program activities.

        (B) __Public sector activities__ 

            The term “public sector activities” may include sovereign loans assumed by the recipient country to contribute to the financing of the investment plan.

        (C) __Clean energy technology__ 

        The term “clean energy technology” means a technology that, as compared with technologies being deployed at that time for widespread commercial use in the country involved—

            (i) achieves substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions;

            (ii) does not result in significant incremental adverse effects on public health or the environment; and

            (iii)

             does one or more of the following:

                (I) generates electricity or useful thermal energy from a renewable resource;

                (II) substantially increases the energy efficiency of buildings, industrial, or agricultural processes, or of electricity transmission, distribution, or end-use consumption; or

                (III) substantially increases the energy efficiency of the transportation system or increases utilization of transportation fuels that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that are substantially lower than those attributable to fossil fuel-based alternatives.
