        (2)

         The President may utilize such authority contained in the Foreign Service Act of 1980 \[[22 U.S.C. 3901][/us/usc/t22/s3901] et seq.\] relating to members of the Foreign Service and other United States Government officers and employees as the President deems necessary to carry out functions under this chapter, except that—

            Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply with respect to foreign national employees. Such provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 \[[22 U.S.C. 3901][/us/usc/t22/s3901] et seq.\] (other than the provisions of section 309 \[[22 U.S.C. 3949][/us/usc/t22/s3949]\]) as the President deems appropriate shall apply to individuals appointed or assigned under this paragraph, including in all cases, the provisions of section 310 of that Act \[[22 U.S.C. 3950][/us/usc/t22/s3950]\], except that (i) the President may by regulation make exceptions to the application of section 310 \[[22 U.S.C. 3950][/us/usc/t22/s3950]\] in cases in which the period of the appointment or assignment exceeds thirty months, (ii) members of the Foreign Service appointed or assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall receive within-class salary increases in accordance with such regulations as the President may prescribe, and (iii) under such regulations as the President may prescribe, individuals who are to perform duties of a more routine nature than are generally performed by members of the Foreign Service assigned to class 9 in the Foreign Service Schedule may be appointed to an unenumerated class ranking below class 9 in the Foreign Service Schedule and be paid basic compensation at rates lower than those for class 9, except that such rates may be no less than the then applicable minimum wage rate specified in [section 206(a)(1) of title 29][/us/usc/t29/s206/a/1].

        (3) The President may specify what additional allowance authorized by [section 5941 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5941] and which of the allowances and differentials authorized by sections 5923 through 5925 of such title 5, may be granted to any person employed, appointed, or assigned under this subsection, or contracted with for personal services under [section 2509(a)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s2509/a/5], and may determine the rates thereof not to exceed the rates otherwise granted to employees under the sections of title 5 referred to in this paragraph.

        (4)

         An individual who has received an appointment or assignment in the Foreign Service under this subsection may, not later than September 30, 1982, or three years after separation from such appointment or assignment, whichever is later, be appointed to a position in any United States department, agency, or establishment—

            (A) in the competitive service under title 5 without competitive examination and in accordance with such regulations and conditions consistent with this subsection as may be prescribed by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, or

            (B) in an established merit system in the excepted service,

            if such individual (i) served satisfactorily under the authority of this subsection, as certified by the President, for not less than thirty-six months on a continuous basis without a break in service of more than three days, and (ii) is qualified for the position in question.

        (5)

         Except as provided in paragraph (6), the Director of the Peace Corps may make appointments or assignments of United States citizens under paragraph (2) for periods of more than five years only in the case of individuals whose performance as employees of the Peace Corps has been exceptional and only in order to achieve one or more of the following purposes:

            (B) To permit individuals who have served at least two and one-half years of such an appointment or assignment in the United States to serve abroad thereafter.

            (C) To permit individuals who have served at least two and one-half years of such an appointment or assignment in a recruitment, selection, or training activity to be reassigned to an activity other than the one in which they have most recently so served.

            (D) To promote the continuity of functions in administering the Peace Corps.

            At no time may the number of appointments or assignments of United States citizens in effect under paragraph (2) for periods in excess of five years exceed fifteen percent of the total of all appointments and assignments of United States citizens then in effect under paragraph (2).

        (6) Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in paragraph (2)(A) on the length of an appointment or assignment under paragraph (2) and notwithstanding the limitations set forth in paragraph (5) on the circumstances under which such an appointment or assignment may exceed five years, the Director of the Peace Corps, under special circumstances, may personally approve an extension of an appointment or assignment under paragraph (2) for not more than one year on an individual basis.
