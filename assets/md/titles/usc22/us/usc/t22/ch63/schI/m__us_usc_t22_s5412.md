## § 5412. Stabilization assistance for Poland

        (1) should work closely with the European Community and international financial institutions to determine the extent of emergency assistance required by Poland for the fourth quarter of 1989, and

        (2) should consider extending a bridge loan to relieve immediate and urgent balance of payments requirements using the Exchange Stabilization Fund in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) of [section 5411(b) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s5411/b].

    (b) __Immediate, multilateral response to Poland’s economic stabilization needs__ 

        In furtherance of [section 5411(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s5411/b/1], the President, acting in coordination with the European Community, should seek to ensure that the industrialized democracies undertake an immediate, multilateral effort to respond to Poland’s request for $1,000,000,000 to support its economic stabilization program.
