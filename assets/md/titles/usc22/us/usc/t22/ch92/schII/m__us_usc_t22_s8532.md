## § 8532. Authority of State and local governments to divest from certain companies that invest in Iran

    (a) __Sense of Congress__ 

        It is the sense of Congress that the United States should support the decision of any State or local government that for moral, prudential, or reputational reasons divests from, or prohibits the investment of assets of the State or local government in, a person that engages in investment activities in the energy sector of Iran, as long as Iran is subject to economic sanctions imposed by the United States.

    (b) __Authority to divest__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or local government may adopt and enforce measures that meet the requirements of subsection (d) to divest the assets of the State or local government from, or prohibit investment of the assets of the State or local government in, any person that the State or local government determines, using credible information available to the public, engages in investment activities in Iran described in subsection (c).

    (c) __Investment activities described__ 

    A person engages in investment activities in Iran described in this subsection if the person—

        (1) has an investment of $20,000,000 or more in the energy sector of Iran, including in a person that provides oil or liquified natural gas tankers, or products used to construct or maintain pipelines used to transport oil or liquified natural gas, for the energy sector of Iran; or

        (2) is a financial institution that extends $20,000,000 or more in credit to another person, for 45 days or more, if that person will use the credit for investment in the energy sector of Iran.

    (d) __Requirements__ 

    Any measure taken by a State or local government under subsection (b) shall meet the following requirements:

        (1) __Notice__ 

            The State or local government shall provide written notice to each person to which a measure is to be applied.

        (2) __Timing__ 

            The measure shall apply to a person not earlier than the date that is 90 days after the date on which written notice is provided to the person under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Opportunity for hearing__ 

            The State or local government shall provide an opportunity to comment in writing to each person to which a measure is to be applied. If the person demonstrates to the State or local government that the person does not engage in investment activities in Iran described in subsection (c), the measure shall not apply to the person.

        (4) __Sense of Congress on avoiding erroneous targeting__ 

            It is the sense of Congress that a State or local government should not adopt a measure under subsection (b) with respect to a person unless the State or local government has made every effort to avoid erroneously targeting the person and has verified that the person engages in investment activities in Iran described in subsection (c).

    (e) __Notice to Department of Justice__ 

        Not later than 30 days after adopting a measure pursuant to subsection (b), a State or local government shall submit written notice to the Attorney General describing the measure.

    (f) __Nonpreemption__ 

        A measure of a State or local government authorized under subsection (b) or (i) is not preempted by any Federal law or regulation.

    (g) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Assets__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “assets” refers to public monies and includes any pension, retirement, annuity, or endowment fund, or similar instrument, that is controlled by a State or local government.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                The term “assets” does not include employee benefit plans covered by title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ([29 U.S.C. 1001][/us/usc/t29/s1001] et seq.).

        (2) __Investment__ 

        The “investment” includes—
