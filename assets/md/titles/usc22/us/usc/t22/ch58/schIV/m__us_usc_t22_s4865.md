 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 106–113, div. B][/us/pl/106/113/dB], § 1000(a)(7) \[div. A, title VI, § 602\], Nov. 29, 1999, [113 Stat. 1536][/us/stat/113/1536], 1501A–451, provided that: 

> “Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in the attack.

>     “(2) The United States personnel in both Dar es Salaam and Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.

>     “(3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for attacks against United States interests anywhere in the world.

>     “(4) Threats continue to be made against United States diplomatic facilities.

>     “(5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following the bombings, as required by [Public Law 99–399][/us/pl/99/399] \[see Tables for classification\], chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret.) (in this section referred to as the ‘Crowe panels’).

>     “(6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security report in 1985.

>     “(7)

>      The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many problems with security at United States diplomatic facilities, in particular the following:

>         “(A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate resources to security against terrorist attacks.

>         “(B) The United States Government places too low a priority on security concerns.

>     “(8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

>     “(9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.

>     “(10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for security programs is widely shared throughout the United States Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks.

>     “(11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other United States Government positions abroad can never be completely without risk, the United States Government must take all reasonable steps to minimize security risks.”

Amounts advanced by such agencies to the Department of State shall be credited to the Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance account, and remain available until expended.
