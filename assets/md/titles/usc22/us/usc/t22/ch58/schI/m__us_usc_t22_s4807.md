        (1) __In general__ 

        The Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, in coordination with the appropriate officials of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the coordinator for counterterrorism, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Department of Homeland Security, and consistent with the strategy mandated by section 7201, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  shall ensure the preparation of a strategic plan to target and disrupt individuals and organizations, within the United States and in foreign countries, that are involved in the fraudulent production, distribution, use, or other similar activity—

            (C) of passports and visas issued by foreign countries intended to gain unlawful entry into the United States.

        (2) __Emphasis__ 

        The strategic plan shall—

            (A) focus particular emphasis on individuals and organizations that may have links to domestic terrorist organizations or foreign terrorist organizations (as such term is defined in [section 1189 of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1189]);

            (B) require the development of a strategic training course under the Antiterrorism Assistance Training (ATA) program of the Department of State (or any successor or related program) under chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ([22 U.S.C. 2349aa][/us/usc/t22/s2349aa] et seq.) (or other relevant provisions of law) to train participants in the identification of fraudulent documents and the forensic detection of such documents which may be used to obtain unlawful entry into the United States; and

            (C) determine the benefits and costs of providing technical assistance to foreign governments to ensure the security of passports, visas, and related documents and to investigate, arrest, and prosecute individuals who facilitate travel by the creation of false passports and visas, documents to obtain such passports and visas, and other types of travel documents.

    (c) __Program__ 

        (1) __Individual in charge__ 

            (A) __Designation__ 

                The Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security shall designate an individual to be in charge of the Program.

            (B) __Qualification__ 

                The individual designated under subparagraph (A) shall have expertise and experience in the investigation and prosecution of visa and passport fraud.

        (2) __Program components__ 

        The Program shall include the following:

            (A) __Analysis of methods__ 

                Analyze, in coordination with other appropriate government agencies, methods used by terrorists to travel internationally, particularly the use of false or altered travel documents to illegally enter foreign countries and the United States, and consult with the Bureau of Consular Affairs and the Secretary of Homeland Security on recommended changes to the visa issuance process that could combat such methods, including the introduction of new technologies into such process.

            (B) __Identification of individuals and documents__ 

                Identify, in cooperation with the Human Trafficking and Smuggling Center, individuals who facilitate travel by the creation of false passports and visas, documents used to obtain such passports and visas, and other types of travel documents, and ensure that the appropriate agency is notified for further investigation and prosecution or, in the case of such individuals abroad for which no further investigation or prosecution is initiated, ensure that all appropriate information is shared with foreign governments in order to facilitate investigation, arrest, and prosecution of such individuals.

            (C) __Identification of foreign countries needing assistance__ 

                Identify foreign countries that need technical assistance, such as law reform, administrative reform, prosecutorial training, or assistance to police and other investigative services, to ensure passport, visa, and related document security and to investigate, arrest, and prosecute individuals who facilitate travel by the creation of false passports and visas, documents used to obtain such passports and visas, and other types of travel documents.

            (D) __Inspection of applications__ 

                Randomly inspect visa and passport applications for accuracy, efficiency, and fraud, especially at high terrorist threat posts, in order to prevent a recurrence of the issuance of visas to those who submit incomplete, fraudulent, or otherwise irregular or incomplete applications.

    (d) __Report__ 

    Not later than 90 days after the date on which the strategy required under section 7201 1 is submitted to Congress, the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security shall submit to Congress a report containing—

        (1) a description of the strategic plan prepared under subsection (b); and

        (2) an evaluation of the feasibility of establishing civil service positions in field offices of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to investigate visa and passport fraud, including an evaluation of whether to allow diplomatic security agents to convert to civil service officers to fill such positions.
