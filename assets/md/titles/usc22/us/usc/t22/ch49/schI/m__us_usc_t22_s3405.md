## § 3405. Contributions by other countries to support peace in the Middle East

    (a) __Presidential consultations with other countries__ 

        It is the sense of the Congress that other countries should give favorable consideration to providing support for the implementation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Therefore, the Congress requests that the President consult with other countries in order to (1) promote and develop an agreement for the establishment of a peace development fund whose purpose would be to underwrite the costs of implementing a Middle East peace, and (2) encourage investments in Israel and Egypt and other countries in the region should they join in Middle East peace agreements.

    (b) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 97–113, title VII, § 734(a)(4)__  __][/us/pl/97/113/s734/a/4]__  __,__  __Dec. 29, 1981__  __,__  __[__  __95 Stat. 1560__  __][/us/stat/95/1560]__
