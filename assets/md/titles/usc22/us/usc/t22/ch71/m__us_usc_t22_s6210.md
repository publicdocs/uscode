## § 6210. Preservation of American jobs

    It is the sense of the Congress that the Director of the United States Information Agency and the Chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting should, in developing the plan for consolidation and reorganization of overseas international broadcasting services, limit, to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with the purposes of the consolidation, elimination of any United States-based positions and should affirmatively seek to transfer as many positions as possible to the United States.

([Pub. L. 103–236, title III][/us/pl/103/236/tIII], § 311, Apr. 30, 1994, [108 Stat. 444][/us/stat/108/444].)

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    United States Information Agency (other than Broadcasting Board of Governors and International Broadcasting Bureau) abolished and functions transferred to Secretary of State, see sections 6531 and 6532 of this title.
