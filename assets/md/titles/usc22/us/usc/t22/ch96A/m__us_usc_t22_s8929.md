## § 8929. Report on non-compliance by the Russian Federation of its obligations under the INF Treaty

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress makes the following findings:

        (1) The Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988 (commonly referred to as the “Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty” or “INF Treaty”).

        (2) This behavior poses a threat to the United States, its deployed forces, and its allies.

    (b) __Sense of Congress__ 

    It is the sense of Congress that—

        (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation accountable for being in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty; and

        (2) the President should demand the Russian Federation completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that constitute the violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty.

    (c) __Report__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 90 days after December 18, 2014, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall submit to the committees specified in subsection (d) a report that includes the following elements:

            (A) A description of the status of the President’s efforts, in cooperation with United States allies, to hold the Russian Federation accountable for being in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty and obtain the complete and verifiable elimination of its military systems that constitute the violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty.

            (B) The President’s assessment as to whether it remains in the national security interests of the United States to remain a party to the INF Treaty, and other related treaties and agreements, while the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty.

            (C) Notification of any deployment by the Russian Federation of a ground launched ballistic or cruise missile system with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.

            (D) A plan developed by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), to verify that the Russian Federation has fully and completely dismantled any ground launched cruise missiles or ballistic missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, including details on facilities that inspectors need access to, people inspectors need to talk with, how often inspectors need the accesses for, and how much the verification regime would cost.

        (2) __Form__ 

            The report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex.

    (d) __Committees specified__ 

    The committees specified in this subsection are—

        (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and

        (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.
