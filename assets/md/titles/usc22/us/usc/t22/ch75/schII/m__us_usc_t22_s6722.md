## § 6722. Facility agreements

    (a) __Authorization of inspections__ 

        Inspections by the Technical Secretariat of plants, plant sites, or other facilities or locations for which the United States has a facility agreement with the Organization shall be conducted in accordance with the facility agreement. Any such facility agreement may not in any way limit the right of the owner or operator of the facility to withhold consent to an inspection request.

    (b) __Types of facility agreements__ 

        (1) __Schedule 2 facilities__ 

            The United States National Authority shall ensure that facility agreements for plants, plant sites, or other facilities or locations that are subject to inspection pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article VI of the Convention are concluded unless the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the facility and the Technical Secretariat agree that such an agreement is not necessary.

        (2) __Schedule 3 facilities__ 

            The United States National Authority shall ensure that facility agreements are concluded for plants, plant sites, or other facilities or locations that are subject to inspection pursuant to paragraph 5 or 6 of Article VI of the Convention if so requested by the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the facility.

    (c) __Notification requirements__ 

        The United States National Authority shall ensure that the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of a facility prior to the development of the agreement relating to that facility is notified and, if the person notified so requests, the person may participate in the preparations for the negotiation of such an agreement. To the maximum extent practicable consistent with the Convention, the owner and the operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility may observe negotiations of the agreement between the United States and the Organization concerning that facility.

    (d) __Content of facility agreements__ 

    Facility agreements shall—

        (1) identify the areas, equipment, computers, records, data, and samples subject to inspection;

        (2) describe the procedures for providing notice of an inspection to the owner, occupant, operator, or agent in charge of a facility;

        (3) describe the timeframes for inspections; and
