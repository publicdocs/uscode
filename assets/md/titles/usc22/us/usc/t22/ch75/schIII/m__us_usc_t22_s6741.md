            (A) maintain and permit access to records related to that production, processing, consumption, export, or import of such substance; and

            (B) submit to the Director of the United States National Authority such reports as the United States National Authority may reasonably require to provide to the Organization, pursuant to subparagraph 1(a) of the Annex on Confidentiality of the Convention, the minimum amount of information and data necessary for the timely and efficient conduct by the Organization of its responsibilities under the Convention.

        (2) __Rulemaking__ 

            The Director of the United States National Authority shall ensure that regulations pursuant to this section are prescribed expeditiously.

    (b) __Coordination__ 

        (1) __Avoidance of duplication__ 

            To the extent feasible, the United States Government shall not require the submission of any report that is unnecessary or duplicative of any report required by or under any other law. The head of each Federal agency shall coordinate the actions of that agency with the heads of the other Federal agencies in order to avoid the imposition of duplicative reporting requirements under this chapter or any other law.

        (2) __Definition__ 

            As used in paragraph (1), the term “Federal agency” has the meaning given the term “agency” in [section 551(1) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s551/1].
