## § 6713. Civil liability of United States

    (a) __Claims for taking of property__ 

        (1) __Jurisdiction of courts of the United States__ 

            (A) __United States Court of Federal Claims__ 

                The United States Court of Federal Claims shall, subject to subparagraph (B), have jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against the United States for any taking of property without just compensation that occurs by reason of the action of any officer or employee of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, including any member of an inspection team of the Technical Secretariat, or by reason of the action of any officer or employee of the United States pursuant to this chapter or the Convention. For purposes of this subsection, action taken pursuant to or under the color of this chapter or the Convention shall be deemed to be action taken by the United States for a public purpose.

            (B) __District courts__ 

                The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of any civil action or claim described in subparagraph (A) that does not exceed $10,000.

        (2) __Notification__ 

            Any person intending to bring a civil action pursuant to paragraph (1) shall notify the United States National Authority of that intent at least one year before filing the claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Action on any claim filed during that one-year period shall be stayed. The one-year period following the notification shall not be counted for purposes of any law limiting the period within which the civil action may be commenced.

        (3) __Initial steps by United States Government to seek remedies__ 

            During the period between a notification pursuant to paragraph (2) and the filing of a claim covered by the notification in the United States Court of Federal Claims, the United States National Authority shall pursue all diplomatic and other remedies that the United States National Authority considers necessary and appropriate to seek redress for the claim including, but not limited to, the remedies provided for in the Convention and under this chapter.

        (4) __Burden of proof__ 

        In any civil action under paragraph (1), the plaintiff shall have the burden to establish a prima facie case that, due to acts or omissions of any official of the Organization or any member of an inspection team of the Technical Secretariat taken under the color of the Convention, proprietary information of the plaintiff has been divulged or taken without authorization. If the United States Court of Federal Claims finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated such a prima facie case, the burden shall shift to the United States to disprove the plaintiff’s claim. In deciding whether the plaintiff has carried its burden, the United States Court of Federal Claims shall consider, among other things—

            (A) the value of proprietary information;

            (B) the availability of the proprietary information;

            (C) the extent to which the proprietary information is based on patents, trade secrets, or other protected intellectual property;

            (D) the significance of proprietary information; and

            (E) the emergence of technology elsewhere a reasonable time after the inspection.

    (b) __Tort liability__ 

        The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions for money damages for any tort under the Constitution or any Federal or State law arising from the acts or omissions of any officer or employee of the United States or the Organization, including any member of an inspection team of the Technical Secretariat, taken pursuant to or under color of the Convention or this chapter.

    (c) __Waiver of sovereign immunity of United States__ 

        In any action under subsection (a) or (b), the United States may not raise sovereign immunity as a defense.

    (d) __Authority for cause of action__ 

        (1) __United States actions in United States district court__ 

            Notwithstanding any other law, the Attorney General of the United States is authorized to bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against any foreign nation for money damages resulting from that nation’s refusal to provide indemnification to the United States for any liability imposed on the United States by virtue of the actions of an inspector of the Technical Secretariat who is a national of that foreign nation acting at the direction or the behest of that foreign nation.

        (2) __United States actions in courts outside the United States__ 

            The Attorney General is authorized to seek any and all available redress in any international tribunal for indemnification to the United States for any liability imposed on the United States by virtue of the actions of an inspector of the Technical Secretariat, and to seek such redress in the courts of the foreign nation from which the inspector is a national.

        (3) __Actions brought by individuals and businesses__ 

            Notwithstanding any other law, any national of the United States, or any business entity organized and operating under the laws of the United States, may bring a civil action in a United States District Court for money damages against any foreign national or any business entity organized and operating under the laws of a foreign nation for an unauthorized or unlawful acquisition, receipt, transmission, or use of property by or on behalf of such foreign national or business entity as a result of any tort under the Constitution or any Federal or State law arising from acts or omissions by any officer or employee of the United States or any member of an inspection team of the Technical Secretariat taken pursuant to or under the color of the Convention or this chapter.

    (e) __Recoupment__ 

        (1) __Policy__ 

            It is the policy of the United States to recoup all funds withdrawn from the Treasury of the United States in payment for any tort under Federal or State law or taking under the Constitution arising from the acts or omissions of any foreign person, officer, or employee of the Organization, including any member of an inspection team of the Technical Secretariat, taken under color of the Chemical Weapons Convention or this chapter.
