                Any person that is determined, in accordance with paragraph (2), to have violated [section 6726 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6726] shall be required by order to pay a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. For purposes of this paragraph, each day such a violation of [section 6726 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6726] continues shall constitute a separate violation of that section.

                Any person that is determined, in accordance with paragraph (2), to have violated [section 6745 of this title][/us/usc/t22/s6745] shall be required by order to pay a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each such violation.

        (2) __Hearing__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Before imposing an order described in paragraph (1) against a person under this subsection for a violation of section 6726 or 6745 of this title, the Secretary of State shall provide the person or entity with notice and, upon request made within 15 days of the date of the notice, a hearing respecting the violation.

            (B) __Conduct of hearing__ 

                Any hearing so requested shall be conducted before an administrative law judge. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of [section 554 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s554]. If no hearing is so requested, the Secretary of State’s imposition of the order shall constitute a final and unappealable order.

            (C) __Issuance of orders__ 

                If the administrative law judge determines, upon the preponderance of the evidence received, that a person or entity named in the complaint has violated section 6726 or 6745 of this title, the administrative law judge shall state his findings of fact and issue and cause to be served on such person or entity an order described in paragraph (1).

            (D) __Factors for determination of penalty amounts__ 

                In determining the amount of any civil penalty, the administrative law judge shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the violator, the ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of prior such violations, the degree of culpability, the existence of an internal compliance program, and such other matters as justice may require.

        (3) __Administrative appellate review__ 

            The decision and order of an administrative law judge shall become the final agency decision and order of the head of the United States National Authority unless, within 30 days, the head of the United States National Authority modifies or vacates the decision and order, with or without conditions, in which case the decision and order of the head of the United States National Authority shall become a final order under this subsection.

        (4) __Offsets__ 

            The amount of the civil penalty under a final order of the United States National Authority may be deducted from any sums owed by the United States to the person.

        (5) __Judicial review__ 

            A person adversely affected by a final order respecting an assessment may, within 30 days after the date the final order is issued, file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which the person resides or transacts business.

        (6) __Enforcement of orders__ 

        If a person fails to comply with a final order issued under this subsection against the person or entity—

            (A) after the order making the assessment has become a final order and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (5), or

            (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (5) has entered a final judgment in favor of the United States National Authority,

            the Secretary of State shall file a suit to seek compliance with the order in any appropriate district court of the United States, plus interest at currently prevailing rates calculated from the date of expiration of the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (5) or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be. In any such suit, the validity and appropriateness of the final order shall not be subject to review.

    (b) __Criminal__ 

        Any person who knowingly violates any provision of section 6726 or 6745 of this title, shall, in addition to or in lieu of any civil penalty which may be imposed under subsection (a) for such violation, be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
