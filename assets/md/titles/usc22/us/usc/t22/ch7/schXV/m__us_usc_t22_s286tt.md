## § 286tt. Restrictions on use of United States funds for foreign governments; protection of American taxpayers

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund—

        (1)

         to evaluate, prior to consideration by the Board of Executive Directors of the Fund, any proposal submitted to the Board for the Fund to make a loan to a country if—

            (A) the amount of the public debt of the country exceeds the gross domestic product of the country as of the most recent year for which such information is available; and

            (B) the country is not eligible for assistance from the International Development Association.

        (2) __Opposition to loans unlikely to be repaid in full.—__ 

        If any such evaluation indicates that the proposed loan is not likely to be repaid in full, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director at the Fund to use the voice and vote of the United States to oppose the proposal.

    (b) __Reports to Congress__ 

    Within 30 days after the Board of Executive Directors of the Fund approves a proposal described in subsection (a), and annually thereafter by June 30, for the duration of any program approved under such proposals, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report in writing to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate assessing the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full, including—

        (1) the borrowing country’s current debt status, including, to the extent possible, its maturity structure, whether it has fixed or floating rates, whether it is indexed, and by whom it is held;

        (2) the borrowing country’s external and internal vulnerabilities that could potentially affect its ability to repay; and

        (3) the borrowing country’s debt management strategy.
