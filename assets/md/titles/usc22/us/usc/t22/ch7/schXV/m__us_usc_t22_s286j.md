## § 286j. Use of Fund resources

    (a) __Official interpretation of authority of Fund__ 

        The governor and executive director of the Fund appointed by the United States are directed to obtain promptly an official interpretation by the Fund as to whether its authority to use its resources extends beyond current monetary stabilization operations to afford temporary assistance to members in connection with seasonal, cyclical, and emergency fluctuations in the balance of payment of any member for current transactions, and whether it has authority to use its resources to provide facilities for relief, reconstruction, or armaments, or to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital on the part of any member.

    (b) __Proposal of amendment__ 

        If the interpretation by the Fund answers in the affirmative any of the questions stated in subsection (a), the governor of the Fund representing the United States is directed to propose promptly and support an amendment to the Articles of Agreement for the purpose of expressly negativing such interpretation. The President is authorized and directed to accept an amendment to that effect on behalf of the United States.
