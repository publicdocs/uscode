## § 287j. Participation in future United Nations borrowing; promotion of pattern of financing to avoid future large-scale deficits; report to Congress

    Nothing herein shall be regarded as authorizing the United States to participate in any future United Nations borrowing. It is the sense of the Congress that the United States shall use its best efforts to promote a pattern of United Nations financing (including a vigorous program for collection of delinquencies on annual assessments of nations and maintenance of such annual assessments on a current basis) that will avoid any future large-scale deficits.

([Pub. L. 87–731][/us/pl/87/731], § 4, Oct. 2, 1962, [76 Stat. 696][/us/stat/76/696].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section originally contained a provision instructing the Department of State to submit to the Congress, not later than Jan. 31, 1963, a report on steps taken in the 17th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on long term financing of the United Nations which was omitted.

    Section was not enacted as part of [act Dec. 20, 1945, ch. 583][/us/act/1945-12-20/ch583], [59 Stat. 619][/us/stat/59/619], known as the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, which comprises this subchapter.
