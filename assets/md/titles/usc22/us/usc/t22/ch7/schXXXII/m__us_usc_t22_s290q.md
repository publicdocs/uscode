## § 290q. Organization of American States revitalization and reform strategy

    (a) __Strategy__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 180 days after October 2, 2013, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a multiyear strategy that—

            (A) identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that prioritize and reinforce the OAS’s core competencies described in section 4(8);

            (B)

             outlines an approach to secure from the OAS effective adoption of—

                (i) a results-based budgeting process in order to strategically prioritize, and where appropriate, reduce current and future mandates; and

                (ii) transparent hiring, firing, and promotion practices;

            (C) reflects the inputs and coordination from other Executive Branch agencies, as appropriate; and

            (D)

             identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would—

                (i) lead to an assessed fee structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed yearly fees; and

                (ii) seek to minimize the negative financial impact on the OAS and its operations.

        (2) __Policy priorities and coordination__ 

        The Secretary of State shall—

            (A) carry out diplomatic engagement to build support for reforms and budgetary burden sharing among OAS member states and observers; and

            (B) promote donor coordination among OAS member states.

    (b) __Briefings__ 

    The Secretary of State shall offer to the committees referred to in subsection (a)(1) a quarterly briefing that—

        (1) reviews assessed and voluntary contributions;

        (2) analyzes the progress made by the OAS to adopt and effectively implement a results-based budgeting process in order to strategically prioritize, and where appropriate, reduce current and future mandates;

        (3) analyzes the progress made by the OAS to adopt and effectively implement transparent and merit-based human resource standards and practices and transparent hiring, firing, and promotion standards and processes, including with respect to factors such as gender and national origin;

        (4) analyzes the progress made by the OAS to adopt and effectively implement a practice of soliciting member quotas to be paid on a schedule that will improve the consistency of its operating budget; and

        (5) analyzes the progress made by the OAS to review, streamline, and prioritize mandates to focus on core missions and make efficient and effective use of available funding.
