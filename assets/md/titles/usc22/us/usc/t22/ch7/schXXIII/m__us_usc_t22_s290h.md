## § 290h. Congressional findings

    The Congress finds that—

    (1) social and economic development ultimately depends on the active participation of individuals within a society and on the enhancement of opportunities for those individuals;

    (2) the development of individuals and institutions in African countries can benefit by the provision of support for community-based self-help activities;

    (3) by enacting title IX of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \[[22 U.S.C. 2218][/us/usc/t22/s2218]\], and recent amendments to that Act, the Congress has sought to enable the poor to participate in the process of development;

    (4) the Inter-American Foundation, established by Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 \[[22 U.S.C. 290f][/us/usc/t22/s290f]\], to support the efforts of the people of Latin America and the Caribbean to solve their development problems, has demonstrated a successful approach to development; and

    (5) an African Development Foundation similar in structure to the Inter-American Foundation, but adapted to the specific needs of Africa, can complement current United States development programs in Africa.
