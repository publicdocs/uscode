            (A) ensuring full respect for the commercial orientation of commercial bank lending;

            (B) ensuring that governments will not intervene in bank management and lending decisions (except in regard to prudential supervision);

            (C) the enactment and implementation of appropriate financial reform legislation;

            (D) strengthening the domestic financial system and improving transparency and supervision; and

        (4) A description of the implementation of reform measures required by the International Monetary Fund to deregulate and privatize economic activity by ending domestic monopolies, undertaking trade liberalization, and opening up restricted areas of the economy to foreign investment and competition.

        (5) A detailed description of the trade policies of the countries, including any unfair trade practices or adverse effects of the trade policies on the United States.

        (6) A description of the extent to which the financial stabilization programs have resulted in appropriate burden-sharing among private sector creditors, including rescheduling of outstanding loans by lengthening maturities, agreements on debt reduction, and the extension of new credit.

        (7) A description of the extent to which the economic adjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund and the policies of the government of the country adequately balance the need for financial stabilization, economic growth, environmental protection, social stability, and equity for all elements of the society.

        (8) Whether International Monetary Fund involvement in labor market flexibility measures has had a negative effect on core worker rights, particularly the rights of free association and collective bargaining.

        (9) A description of any pattern of abuses of core worker rights in recipient countries.
