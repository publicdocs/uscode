            (B) from among individuals serving as officials required by law to be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and

        (2) a Director of the Bank, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

    (b) No person shall be entitled to receive any salary or other compensation from the United States for services as a Governor or Alternate Governor.
