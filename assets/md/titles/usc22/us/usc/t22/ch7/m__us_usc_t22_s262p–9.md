## § 262p–9. Reform of the “Doing Business” Report of the World Bank

    (a)

     The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation of the following United States policy goals, and to use the voice and vote of the United States to actively promote and work to achieve these goals:

        (1) Suspension of the use of the “Employing Workers” Indicator for the purpose of ranking or scoring country performance in the annual Doing Business Report of the World Bank until a set of indicators can be devised that fairly represent the value of internationally recognized workers’ rights, including core labor standards, in creating a stable and favorable environment for attracting private investment. The indicators shall bring to bear the experiences of the member governments in dealing with the economic, social and political complexity of labor market issues. The indicators should be developed through collaborative discussions with and between the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the International Labor Organization, private companies, and labor unions.

        (2) Elimination of the “Labor Tax and Social Contributions” Subindicator from the annual Doing Business Report of the World Bank.

        (3) Removal of the “Employing Workers” Indicator as a “guidepost” for calculating the annual Country Policy and Institutional Assessment score for each recipient country.

    (b) Within 60 days after June 24, 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide an instruction to the United States Executive Directors referred to in subsection (a) to take appropriate actions with respect to implementing the policy goals of the United States set forth in subsection (a), and such instruction shall be posted on the website of the Department of the Treasury.
