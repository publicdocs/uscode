            (B) the development of self-evaluation techniques by participants in projects supported under this section, for the purpose of transferring experience gained in such projects to similar development activities;

            (C) development research by Africans and the transfer of development resources, expertise, and knowledge within Africa;

            (D) the procurement of such technical or other assistance as is deemed appropriate by the recipient of such grant, loan, or guarantee, to carry out the purposes of this subchapter; and
