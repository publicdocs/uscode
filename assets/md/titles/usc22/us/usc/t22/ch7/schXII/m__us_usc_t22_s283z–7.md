    (2) take all necessary steps to encourage the Bank to limit the aggregate value of the policy based loans made by the Bank to the government of a particular country during such 4-year period, to 50 percent of the aggregate value of all loans made by the Bank to such government during such 4-year period;

    (3) instruct the United States Executive Director of the Bank to explore with the other Executive Directors of the Bank ways to use a portion of the resources made available to the Bank by reason of the subscription and contribution described in [section 283z–5(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t22/s283z–5/a/2] for debt reduction and debt service reduction for countries described in paragraph (1); and
