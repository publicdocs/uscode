### Rule 34. Oral Argument

    (a) __In General.__ 

        (1) Party’s Statement. Any party may file, or a court may require by local rule, a statement explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.

        (2)

 Standards. Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless a panel of three judges who have examined the briefs and record unanimously agrees that oral argument is unnecessary for any of the following reasons:

            (A) the appeal is frivolous;

            (B) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or

            (C) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.

    (b) __Notice of Argument; Postponement.__ 

     The clerk must advise all parties whether oral argument will be scheduled, and, if so, the date, time, and place for it, and the time allowed for each side. A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date.

    (c) __Order and Contents of Argument.__ 

     The appellant opens and concludes the argument. Counsel must not read at length from briefs, records, or authorities.

    (d) __Cross-Appeals and Separate Appeals.__ 

     If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 28.1(b) determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for purposes of oral argument. Unless the court directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.

    (e) __Nonappearance of a Party.__ 

     If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the court must hear appellant’s argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the court may hear the appellee’s argument. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs, unless the court orders otherwise.

    (f) __Submission on Briefs.__ 

     The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs, but the court may direct that the case be argued.

    (g) __Use of Physical Exhibits at Argument; Removal.__ 

     Counsel intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the exhibits from the courtroom, unless the court directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives notice to remove them.

(As amended Apr. 1, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Mar. 10, 1986, eff. July 1, 1986; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 25, 2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967__ 

    A majority of circuits now limit oral argument to thirty minutes for each side, with the provision that additional time may be made available upon request. The Committee is of the view that thirty minutes to each side is sufficient in most cases, but that where additional time is necessary it should be freely granted on a proper showing of cause therefor. It further feels that the matter of time should be left ultimately to each court of appeals, subject to the spirit of the rule that a reasonable time should be allowed for argument. The term “side” is used to indicate that the time allowed by the rule is afforded to opposing interests rather than to individual parties. Thus if multiple appellants or appellees have a common interest, they constitute only a single side. If counsel for multiple parties who constitute a single side feel that additional time is necessary, they may request it. In other particulars this rule follows the usual practice among the circuits. See 3d Cir. Rule 31; 6th Cir. Rule 20; 10th Cir. Rule 23.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1979 Amendment__ 

    The proposed amendment, patterned after the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, Structure and Internal Procedures: Recommendations for Change, 1975, created by Public Law 489 of the 92nd Cong. 2nd Sess., [86 Stat. 807][/us/stat/86/807], sets forth general principles and minimum standards to be observed in formulating any local rule.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1986 Amendment__ 

    The amendments to Rules 34(a) and (e) are technical. No substantive change is intended.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (d). The amendment of subdivision (d) conforms this rule with the amendment of Rule 28(h).

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (c). The amendment deletes the requirement that the opening argument must include a fair statement of the case. The Committee proposed the change because in some circuits the court does not want appellants to give such statements. In those circuits, the rule is not followed and is misleading. Nevertheless, the Committee does not want the deletion of the requirement to indicate disapproval of the practice. Those circuits that desire a statement of the case may continue the practice.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment__ 

    The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. Substantive changes are made in subdivision (a).

    Subdivision (a). Currently subdivision (a) says that oral argument must be permitted unless, applying a local rule, a panel of three judges unanimously agrees that oral argument is not necessary. Rule 34 then outlines the criteria to be used to determine whether oral argument is needed and requires any local rule to “conform substantially” to the “minimum standard\[s\]” established in the national rule. The amendments omit the local rule requirement and make the criteria applicable by force of the national rule. The local rule is an unnecessary instrument.

    Paragraph (a)(2) states that one reason for deciding that oral argument is unnecessary is that the dispositive issue has been authoritatively decided. The amended language no longer states that the issue must have been “recently” decided. The Advisory Committee does not intend any substantive change, but thinks that the use of “recently” may be misleading.

    Subdivision (d). A cross-reference to Rule 28(h) has been substituted for a reiteration of the provisions of Rule 28(h).

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (d). A cross-reference in subdivision (d) has been changed to reflect the fact that, as part of an effort to collect within one rule all provisions regarding briefing in cases involving cross-appeals, former Rule 28(h) has been abrogated and its contents moved to new Rule 28.1(b).
