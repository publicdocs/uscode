### Rule 42. Voluntary Dismissal

    (a) __Dismissal in the District Court.__ 

     Before an appeal has been docketed by the circuit clerk, the district court may dismiss the appeal on the filing of a stipulation signed by all parties or on the appellant’s motion with notice to all parties.

    (b) __Dismissal in the Court of Appeals.__ 

     The circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. But no mandate or other process may issue without a court order. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant’s motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.

(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967__ 

    Subdivision (a). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) without change of substance.

    Subdivision (b). The first sentence is a common provision in present circuit rules. The second sentence is added. Compare Supreme Court Rule 60.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment__ 

    The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
