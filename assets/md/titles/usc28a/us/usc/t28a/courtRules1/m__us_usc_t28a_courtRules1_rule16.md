### Rule 16. The Record on Review or Enforcement

    (a) __Composition of the Record.__ 

     The record on review or enforcement of an agency order consists of:

        (1) the order involved;

        (2) any findings or report on which it is based; and

        (3) the pleadings, evidence, and other parts of the proceedings before the agency.

    (b) __Omissions From or Misstatements in the Record.__ 

     The parties may at any time, by stipulation, supply any omission from the record or correct a misstatement, or the court may so direct. If necessary, the court may direct that a supplemental record be prepared and filed.

(As amended Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1967__ 

    Subdivision (a) is based upon 28 U.S.C. § 2112(b). There is no distinction between the record compiled in the agency proceeding and the record on review; they are one and the same. The record in agency cases is thus the same as that in appeals from the district court—the original papers, transcripts and exhibits in the proceeding below. Subdivision (b) is based upon section 8 of the uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15).

 __Committee Notes on Rules—1998 Amendment__ 

    The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
