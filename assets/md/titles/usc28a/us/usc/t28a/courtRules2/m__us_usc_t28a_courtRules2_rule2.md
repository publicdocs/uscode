### Rule 2. One Form of Action

    There is one form of action—the civil action.

(As amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1937__ 

    1. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 384 (Suits in equity, when not sustainable). U.S.C., Title 28, §§ 723 and 730 \[see 2071 et seq.\] (conferring power on the Supreme Court to make rules of practice in equity), are unaffected insofar as they relate to the rule making power in admiralty. These sections, together with § 723b \[see 2072\] (Rules in actions at law; Supreme Court authorized to make) are continued insofar as they are not inconsistent with § 723c \[see 2072\] (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme Court). See Note 3 to Rule 1. U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] §§ 724 (Conformity act), 397 (Amendments to pleadings when case brought to wrong side of court) and 398 (Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law) are superseded.

    2. Reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed in these rules.

    3. This rule follows in substance the usual introductory statements to code practices which provide for a single action and mode of procedure, with abolition of forms of action and procedural distinctions. Representative statutes are N.Y. Code 1848 (Laws 1848, ch. 379) § 62; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) § 8; Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) § 307; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) § 9164; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) §§ 153, 255.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

TITLE II. __COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS, MOTIONS, AND ORDERS__
