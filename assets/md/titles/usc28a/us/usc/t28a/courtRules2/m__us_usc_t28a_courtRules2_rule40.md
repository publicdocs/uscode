### Rule 40. Scheduling Cases for Trial

    Each court must provide by rule for scheduling trials. The court must give priority to actions entitled to priority by a federal statute.

(As amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1937__ 

    U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 769 (Notice of case for trial) is modified. See \[former\] Equity Rule 56 (On Expiration of Time for Depositions, Case Goes on Trial Calendar). See also \[former\] Equity Rule 57 (Continuances).

    For examples of statutes giving precedence, see U.S.C., Title 28, § 47 \[now 1253, 2101, 2325\] (Injunctions as to orders of Interstate Commerce Commission); § 380 \[now 1253, 2101, 2284\] (Injunctions alleged unconstitutionality of state statutes); § 380a \[now 1253, 2101, 2284\] (Same; Constitutionality of federal statute); \[former\] § 768 (Priority of cases where a state is party); Title 15, § 28 (Antitrust laws; suits against monopolies expedited); Title 22, § 240 (Petition for restoration of property seized as munitions of war, etc.); and Title 49, \[former\] § 44 (Proceedings in equity under interstate commerce laws; expedition of suits).

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 40 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    The best methods for scheduling trials depend on local conditions. It is useful to ensure that each district adopts an explicit rule for scheduling trials. It is not useful to limit or dictate the provisions of local rules.
