### Rule 80. Stenographic Transcript as Evidence

    If stenographically reported testimony at a hearing or trial is admissible in evidence at a later trial, the testimony may be proved by a transcript certified by the person who reported it.

(As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1937__ 

    Note to Subdivision (a). This follows substantially \[former\] Equity Rule 50 (Stenographer—Appointment—Fees). \[This subdivision was abrogated. See amendment note of Advisory Committee below.\]

    Note to Subdivision (b). See Reports of Conferences of Senior Circuit Judges with the Chief Justice of the United States (1936), 22 A.B.A.J. 818, 819; (1937), 24 A.B.A.J. 75, 77. \[This subdivision was abrogated. See amendment note of Advisory Committee below.\]

    Note to Subdivision (c). Compare Iowa Code (1935) § 11353.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1946 Amendment__ 

    Subdivisions (a) and (b) of Rule 80 have been abrogated because of Public Law 222, 78th Cong., c. 3, 2d Sess., approved Jan. 20, 1944, 28 U.S.C. § 9a \[now 550, 604, 753, 1915, 1920\], providing for the appointment of official stenographers for each district court, prescribing their duties, providing for the furnishing of transcripts, the taxation of the fees therefor as costs, and other related matters. This statute has now been implemented by Congressional appropriation available for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1945.

    Subdivision (c) of Rule 80 (Stenographic Report or Transcript as Evidence) has been retained unchanged.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 80 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
