### Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment

    (a) __Automatic Stay; Exceptions for Injunctions, Receiverships, and Patent Accountings.__ 

     Except as stated in this rule, no execution may issue on a judgment, nor may proceedings be taken to enforce it, until 14 days have passed after its entry. But unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:

        (1) an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction or a receivership; or

        (2) a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an action for patent infringement.

    (b) __Stay Pending the Disposition of a Motion.__ 

     On appropriate terms for the opposing party’s security, the court may stay the execution of a judgment—or any proceedings to enforce it—pending disposition of any of the following motions:

        (1) under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law;

        (2) under Rule 52(b), to amend the findings or for additional findings;

        (3) under Rule 59, for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment; or

        (4) under Rule 60, for relief from a judgment or order.

    (c) __Injunction Pending an Appeal.__ 

     While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party’s rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:

        (1) by that court sitting in open session; or

        (2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their signatures.

    (d) __Stay with Bond on Appeal.__ 

     If an appeal is taken, the appellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond, except in an action described in Rule 62(a)(1) or (2). The bond may be given upon or after filing the notice of appeal or after obtaining the order allowing the appeal. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond.

    (e) __Stay Without Bond on an Appeal by the United States, Its Officers, or Its Agencies.__ 

     The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal government.

    (f) __Stay in Favor of a Judgment Debtor Under State Law.__ 

     If a judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor’s property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.

    (g) __Appellate Court’s Power Not Limited.__ 

     This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:

        (1) to stay proceedings—or suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction—while an appeal is pending; or

        (2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.

    (h) __Stay with Multiple Claims or Parties.__ 

     A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.

(As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Apr. 17, 1961, eff. July 19, 1961; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1937__ 

    Note to Subdivision (a). The first sentence states the substance of the last sentence of U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 874 (Supersedeas). The remainder of the subdivision states the substance of the last clause of U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 227 (Appeals in proceedings for injunctions; receivers; and admiralty), and of \[former\] § 227a (Appeals in suits in equity for infringement of letters patent for inventions; stay of proceedings for accounting), but extended to include final as well as interlocutory judgments.

    Note to Subdivision (b). This modifies U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 840 (Executions; stay on conditions).

    Note to Subdivision (c). Compare \[former\] Equity Rule 74 (Injunction Pending Appeal); and Cumberland Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, 260 U.S. 212 (1922). See Simkins, Federal Practice (1934) § 916 in regard to the effect of appeal on injunctions and the giving of bonds. See U.S.C., \[former\] Title 6 (Official and Penal Bonds) for bonds by surety companies. For statutes providing for a specially constituted district court of three judges, see:

    U.S.C., Title 7:

     § 217 (Proceedings for suspension of orders of Secretary of Agriculture under Stockyards Act)—by reference.

     § 499k (Injunctions; application of injunction laws governing orders of Interstate Commerce Commission to orders of Secretary of Agriculture under Perishable Commodities Act)—by reference.

    U.S.C., Title 15:

     § 28 (Antitrust laws; suits against monopolies expedited)

    U.S.C., Title 28:

     § 47 \[now 2325\] (Injunctions as to orders of Interstate Commerce Commission, etc.)

     § 380 \[now 2284\] (Injunctions; alleged unconstitutionality of State statutes.)

     § 380a \[now 2284\] (Same; constitutionality of federal statute)

    U.S.C., Title 49:

     § 44 \[former\] (Suits in equity under interstate commerce laws; expedition of suits)

    Note to Subdivision (d). This modifies U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 874 (Supersedeas). See Rule 36(2), Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, which governs supersedeas bonds on direct appeals to the Supreme Court, and Rule 73(d), of these rules, which governs supersedeas bonds on appeals to a circuit court of appeals. The provisions governing supersedeas bonds in both kinds of appeals are substantially the same.

    Note to Subdivision (e). This states the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, § 870 \[now 2408\] (Bond; not required of the United States).

    Note to Subdivision (f). This states the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, \[former\] § 841 (Executions; stay of one term) with appropriate modification to conform to the provisions of Rule 6(c) as to terms of court.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1946 Amendment__ 

    Subdivision (a). \[This subdivision not amended\]. Sections 203 and 204 of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. \[App.\] § 501 et seq. \[§§ 523, 524\]) provide under certain circumstances for the issuance and continuance of a stay of execution of any judgment or order entered against a person in military service. See Bowsman v. Peterson (D.Neb. 1942) 45 F.Supp. 741. Section 201 of the Act \[50 U.S.C. App. § 521\] permits under certain circumstances the issuance of a stay of any action or proceeding at any stage thereof, where either the plaintiff or defendant is a person in military service. See also Note to Rule 64 herein.

    Subdivision (b). This change was necessary because of the proposed addition to Rule 59 of subdivision (e).

    Subdivision (h). In proposing to revise Rule 54(b), the Committee thought it advisable to include a separate provision in Rule 62 for stay of enforcement of a final judgment in cases involving multiple claims.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1948 Amendment__ 

    Section 210 of the Judicial Code, as amended, U.S.C., Title 28, § 47a, is repealed by revised Title 28 and its provisions that stays pending appeals to the Supreme Court in Interstate Commerce Commission cases may be granted only by that court or a justice thereof are not included in revised Title 28. Prior to this repeal the additional general reference in subdivision (g) to “other statutes of the United States”, was needed as a safety residual provision due to the specific reference to Section 210 of the Judicial Code. With the repeal of this latter section there is no need for the residual provision, which has no present applicability; and to the extent that any statute is enacted providing “that stays pending appeals to the Supreme Court may be granted only by that court or a justice thereof” it will govern and will not be inconsistent or repugnant to subdivision (g) as amended.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1961 Amendment__ 

    These changes conform to the amendment of Rule 54(b).

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 62 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

    The final sentence of former Rule 62(a) referred to Rule 62(c). It is deleted as an unnecessary \[sic\]. Rule 62(c) governs of its own force.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment__ 

    The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 6.
