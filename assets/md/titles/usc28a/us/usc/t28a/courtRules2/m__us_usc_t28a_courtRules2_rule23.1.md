### Rule 23.1. Derivative Actions

    (a) __Prerequisites.__ 

     This rule applies when one or more shareholders or members of a corporation or an unincorporated association bring a derivative action to enforce a right that the corporation or association may properly assert but has failed to enforce. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of shareholders or members who are similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.

    (b) __Pleading Requirements.__ 

     The complaint must be verified and must:

        (1) allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction complained of, or that the plaintiff’s share or membership later devolved on it by operation of law;

        (2) allege that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction that the court would otherwise lack; and

        (3)

         state with particularity:

            (A) any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members; and

            (B) the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.

    (c) __Settlement, Dismissal, and Compromise.__ 

     A derivative action may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval. Notice of a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise must be given to shareholders or members in the manner that the court orders.

(As added Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1966__ 

    A derivative action by a shareholder of a corporation or by a member of an unincorporated association has distinctive aspects which require the special provisions set forth in the new rule. The next-to-the-last sentence recognizes that the question of adequacy of representation may arise when the plaintiff is one of a group of shareholders or members. Cf. 3 Moore’s Federal Practice, par. 23.08 (2d ed. 1963).

    The court has inherent power to provide for the conduct of the proceedings in a derivative action, including the power to determine the course of the proceedings and require that any appropriate notice be given to shareholders or members.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 23.1 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
