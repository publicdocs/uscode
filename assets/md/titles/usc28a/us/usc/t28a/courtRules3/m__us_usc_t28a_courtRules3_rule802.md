### Rule 802. The Rule Against Hearsay

    Hearsay is not admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise:

    • a federal statute;

    • these rules; or

    • other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.

([Pub. L. 93–595, § 1][/us/pl/93/595/s1], Jan. 2, 1975, [88 Stat. 1939][/us/stat/88/1939]; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules__ 

The provision excepting from the operation of the rule hearsay which is made admissible by other rules adopted by the Supreme Court or by Act of Congress continues the admissibility thereunder of hearsay which would not qualify under these Evidence Rules. The following examples illustrate the working of the exception:

 __Federal Rules of Civil Procedure__ 

    Rule 4(g): proof of service by affidavit.

    Rule 32: admissibility of depositions.

    Rule 43(e): affidavits when motion based on facts not appearing of record.

    Rule 56: affidavits in summary judgment proceedings.

    Rule 65(b): showing by affidavit for temporary restraining order.

 __Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure__ 

    Rule 4(a): affidavits to show grounds for issuing warrants.

    Rule 12(b)(4): affidavits to determine issues of fact in connection with motions.

 __Acts of Congress__ 

    10 U.S.C. § 7730: affidavits of unavailable witnesses in actions for damages caused by vessel in naval service, or towage or salvage of same, when taking of testimony or bringing of action delayed or stayed on security grounds.

    29 U.S.C. § 161(4): affidavit as proof of service in NLRB proceedings.

    38 U.S.C. § 5206: affidavit as proof of posting notice of sale of unclaimed property by Veterans Administration.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 802 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.
