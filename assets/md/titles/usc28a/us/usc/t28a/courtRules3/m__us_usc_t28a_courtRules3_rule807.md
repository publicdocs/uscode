### Rule 807. Residual Exception

    (a) __In General.__ 

     Under the following circumstances, a hearsay statement is not excluded by the rule against hearsay even if the statement is not specifically covered by a hearsay exception in Rule 803 or 804:

        (1) the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness;

        (2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;

        (3) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts; and

        (4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.

    (b) __Notice.__ 

     The statement is admissible only if, before the trial or hearing, the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable notice of the intent to offer the statement and its particulars, including the declarant’s name and address, so that the party has a fair opportunity to meet it.

(Added Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules__ 

    The contents of Rule 803(24) and Rule 804(b)(5) have been combined and transferred to a new Rule 807. This was done to facilitate additions to Rules 803 and 804. No change in meaning is intended.

    GAP Report on Rule 807. Restylization changes were eliminated.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 807 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.
