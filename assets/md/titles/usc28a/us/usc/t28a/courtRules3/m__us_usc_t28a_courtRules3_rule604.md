### Rule 604. Interpreter

    An interpreter must be qualified and must give an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.

([Pub. L. 93–595, § 1][/us/pl/93/595/s1], Jan. 2, 1975, [88 Stat. 1934][/us/stat/88/1934]; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules__ 

    The rule implements Rule 43(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 28(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, both of which contain provisions for the appointment and compensation of interpreters.

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment__ 

    The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 604 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.
