### Rule 415. Similar Acts in Civil Cases Involving Sexual Assault or Child Molestation

    (a) __Permitted Uses.__ 

     In a civil case involving a claim for relief based on a party’s alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that the party committed any other sexual assault or child molestation. The evidence may be considered as provided in Rules 413 and 414.

    (b) __Disclosure to the Opponent.__ 

     If a party intends to offer this evidence, the party must disclose it to the party against whom it will be offered, including witnesses’ statements or a summary of the expected testimony. The party must do so at least 15 days before trial or at a later time that the court allows for good cause.

    (c) __Effect on Other Rules.__ 

     This rule does not limit the admission or consideration of evidence under any other rule.

(Added [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII, § 320935(a)][/us/pl/103/322/s320935/a], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2137][/us/stat/108/2137]; amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment__

These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 __Effective Date__ 

    Rule effective July 9, 1995, see section 320935(b)–(e) of [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], set out as a note under rule 413 of these rules.
