        (5)  __Abandonment__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding the absence of a claim, upon timely request and as prescribed by the Director, a provisional application may be treated as an application filed under subsection (a).

        (6)  __Other basis for provisional application__  __.—__

A copy of the specification and any drawings of the previously filed application shall be submitted within such period and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Director. A failure to submit the copy of the specification and any drawings of the previously filed application within the prescribed period shall result in the application being regarded as abandoned. Such application shall be treated as having never been filed, unless—

        (1) the application is revived under section 27; and

        (2) a copy of the specification and any drawings of the previously filed application are submitted to the Director.
