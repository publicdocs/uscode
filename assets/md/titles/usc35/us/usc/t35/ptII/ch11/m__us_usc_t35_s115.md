    (b)  __Required Statements__  __.—__ 

    An oath or declaration under subsection (a) shall contain statements that—

        (2)  __Permitted circumstances__  __.—__ 

        A substitute statement under paragraph (1) is permitted with respect to any individual who—

            (A)

                (ii) is under legal incapacity; or

                (iii) cannot be found or reached after diligent effort; or

            (B) is under an obligation to assign the invention but has refused to make the oath or declaration required under subsection (a).

    (f)  __Time for Filing__  __.—__ 

    The applicant for patent shall provide each required oath or declaration under subsection (a), substitute statement under subsection (d), or recorded assignment meeting the requirements of subsection (e) no later than the date on which the issue fee for the patent is paid.

    (g) __Earlier-Filed Application Containing Required Statements or Substitute Statement.—__ 

        (1)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

        The requirements under this section shall not apply to an individual with respect to an application for patent in which the individual is named as the inventor or a joint inventor and that claims the benefit under section 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c) of the filing of an earlier-filed application, if—

            (A) an oath or declaration meeting the requirements of subsection (a) was executed by the individual and was filed in connection with the earlier-filed application;

            (B) a substitute statement meeting the requirements of subsection (d) was filed in connection with the earlier filed application with respect to the individual; or

            (C) an assignment meeting the requirements of subsection (e) was executed with respect to the earlier-filed application by the individual and was recorded in connection with the earlier-filed application.

        (2)  __Copies of oaths, declarations, statements, or assignments__  __.—__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Director may require that a copy of the executed oath or declaration, the substitute statement, or the assignment filed in connection with the earlier-filed application be included in the later-filed application.

        (3)  __Savings clause__  __.—__ 

        A patent shall not be invalid or unenforceable based upon the failure to comply with a requirement under this section if the failure is remedied as provided under paragraph (1).
