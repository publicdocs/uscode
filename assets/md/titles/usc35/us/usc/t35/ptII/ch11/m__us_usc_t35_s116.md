## § 116. Inventors

    (a)  __Joint Inventions__  __.—__ 

    When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly, they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.

    (b)  __Omitted Inventor__  __.—__ 

    If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the application may be made by the other inventor on behalf of himself and the omitted inventor. The Director, on proof of the pertinent facts and after such notice to the omitted inventor as he prescribes, may grant a patent to the inventor making the application, subject to the same rights which the omitted inventor would have had if he had been joined. The omitted inventor may subsequently join in the application.

    (c)  __Correction of Errors in Application__  __.—__ 

    Whenever through error a person is named in an application for patent as the inventor, or through error an inventor is not named in an application, the Director may permit the application to be amended accordingly, under such terms as he prescribes.

([July 19, 1952, ch. 950][/us/act/1952-07-19/ch950], [66 Stat. 799][/us/stat/66/799]; [Pub. L. 97–247, § 6(a)][/us/pl/97/247/s6/a], Aug. 27, 1982, [96 Stat. 320][/us/stat/96/320]; [Pub. L. 98–622, title I, § 104(a)][/us/pl/98/622/s104/a], Nov. 8, 1984, [98 Stat. 3384][/us/stat/98/3384]; [Pub. L. 106–113, div. B, § 1000(a)(9)][/us/pl/106/113/s1000/a/9] \[title IV, § 4732(a)(10)(A)\], Nov. 29, 1999, [113 Stat. 1536][/us/stat/113/1536], 1501A–582; [Pub. L. 107–273, div. C, title III, § 13206(b)(1)(B)][/us/pl/107/273/s13206/b/1/B], Nov. 2, 2002, [116 Stat. 1906][/us/stat/116/1906]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    The first paragraph is implied in the present statutes, and the part of the last paragraph relating to omission of an erroneously joined inventor is in the Patent Office rules. The remainder is new and provides for the correction of a mistake in erroneously joining a person as inventor, and for filing an application when one of several joint inventors cannot be found. This section is ancillary to section 256.

    2011—[Pub. L. 112–29][/us/pl/112/29] designated first to third pars. as subsecs. (a) to (c), respectively, inserted headings, and, in subsec. (c), struck out “and such error arose without any deceptive intention on his part,” before “the Director”.

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–622][/us/pl/98/622] amended first par. generally, striking out “and each sign the application” after “patent jointly” and inserting sentence beginning “Inventors may apply”.

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–247][/us/pl/97/247] substituted “Inventors” for “Joint inventors” as section catchline, and substituted “through error a person is named in an application for patent as the inventor, or through error an inventor is not named in an application” for “a person is joined in an application for patent as joint inventor through error, or a joint inventor is not included in an application through error”.
