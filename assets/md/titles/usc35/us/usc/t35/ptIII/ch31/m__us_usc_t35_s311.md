## § 311. Inter partes review

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    Subject to the provisions of this chapter, a person who is not the owner of a patent may file with the Office a petition to institute an inter partes review of the patent. The Director shall establish, by regulation, fees to be paid by the person requesting the review, in such amounts as the Director determines to be reasonable, considering the aggregate costs of the review.

    (b)  __Scope__  __.—__ 

    A petitioner in an inter partes review may request to cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of a patent only on a ground that could be raised under section 102 or 103 and only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications.

    (c)  __Filing Deadline__  __.—__ 

    A petition for inter partes review shall be filed after the later of either—

        (1) the date that is 9 months after the grant of a patent; or

        (2) if a post-grant review is instituted under chapter 32, the date of the termination of such post-grant review.
