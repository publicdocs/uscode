## § 286. Time limitation on damages

    Except as otherwise provided by law, no recovery shall be had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the action.

    In the case of claims against the United States Government for use of a patented invention, the period before bringing suit, up to six years, between the date of receipt of a written claim for compensation by the department or agency of the Government having authority to settle such claim, and the date of mailing by the Government of a notice to the claimant that his claim has been denied shall not be counted as part of the period referred to in the preceding paragraph.

([July 19, 1952, ch. 950][/us/act/1952-07-19/ch950], [66 Stat. 813][/us/stat/66/813].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 70, part (R.S. 4921, amended (1) [Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391][/us/act/1897-03-03/ch391], § 6, [29 Stat. 694][/us/stat/29/694], (2) [Feb. 18, 1922, ch. 58][/us/act/1922-02-18/ch58], § 8, [42 Stat. 392][/us/stat/42/392], (3) [Aug. 1, 1946, ch. 726][/us/act/1946-08-01/ch726], § 1, [60 Stat. 778][/us/stat/60/778]).

    The first paragraph is the same as the provision in R.S. 4921 with minor changes in language, with the added provision relating to the date for counterclaims for infringement.

    The second paragraph is new and relates to extending the period of limitations with respect to suits in the Court of Claims in certain instances when administrative consideration is pending.
