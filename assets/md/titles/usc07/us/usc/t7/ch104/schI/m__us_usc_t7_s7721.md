            (A) the plant pests become established; or

            (B) the plant pest infestations become too large and costly to eradicate or control.

        (2) __Specialty crop__ 

            The term “specialty crop” has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 ([7 U.S.C. 1621][/us/usc/t7/s1621] note; [Public Law 108–465][/us/pl/108/465]).

                (i) the requirements to be imposed on a State department of agriculture for auditing of, and reporting on, the use of any funds provided by the Secretary under the cooperative agreement;

                (ii) the criteria to be used to ensure that early pest detection and surveillance activities supported under the cooperative agreement are based on sound scientific data or thorough risk assessments; and

                (iii) the means of identifying pathways of pest introductions.

        (5) __Use of funds__ 

            (A) __Plant pest detection and surveillance activities__ 

                A State department of agriculture that receives funds under this subsection shall use the funds to carry out early plant pest detection and surveillance activities approved by the Secretary to prevent the introduction or spread of a plant pest.

            (B) __Subagreements__

            (C) __Non-Federal share__ 

                The non-Federal share of the cost of carrying out a cooperative agreement under this section may be provided in-kind, including through provision of such indirect costs of the cooperative agreement as the Secretary considers to be appropriate.

            (D) __Ability to provide funds__ 

                The Secretary shall not take the ability to provide non-Federal costs to carry out a cooperative agreement entered into under subparagraph (A) into consideration when deciding whether to enter into a cooperative agreement with a State department of agriculture.

        (6) __Special funding considerations__ 

        The Secretary shall provide funds to a State department of agriculture if the Secretary determines that—

            (A)

             the State department of agriculture is in a State that has a high risk of being affected by 1 or more plant pests or diseases, taking into consideration—

                (i) the number of international ports of entry in the State;

                (ii) the volume of international passenger and cargo entry into the State;

                (iii) the geographic location of the State and if the location or types of agricultural commodities produced in the State are conducive to agricultural pest and disease establishment due to the climate, crop diversity, or natural resources (including unique plant species) of the State; and

                (iv) whether the Secretary has determined that an agricultural pest or disease in the State is a Federal concern; and

            (B)

             the early plant pest detection and surveillance activities supported with the funds will likely—
