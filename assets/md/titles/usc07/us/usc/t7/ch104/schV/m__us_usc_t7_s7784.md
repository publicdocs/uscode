    (d) __Selection of activities__ 

    Activities funded under this section shall be selected by the Secretary taking into consideration the following:

        (2) The likelihood that the activity will prevent or resolve the problem, or increase knowledge about resolving similar problems.

        (3) The extent to which the activity will provide a comprehensive approach to the control or eradication of noxious weeds.

        (4) The extent to which the program will improve the overall capacity of the United States to address noxious weed control and management.

    (f) __Rapid response program__ 

    At the request of the Governor of a State, the Secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement with a weed management entity in that State to enable rapid response to outbreaks of noxious weeds at a stage which rapid eradication and control is possible and to ensure eradication or immediate control of the noxious weeds if—

        (2) the noxious weed is considered to be a significant threat to native fish, wildlife, or their habitats, as determined by the Secretary;
