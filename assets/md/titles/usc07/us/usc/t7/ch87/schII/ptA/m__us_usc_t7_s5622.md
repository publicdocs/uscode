    (c) __Restrictions on use of credit guarantees__

            (B) is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls that financial institution issuing the letter of credit.

        (2) __Third country banks__ 

            The Commodity Credit Corporation may guarantee under subsection (a) of this section the repayment of credit made available to finance an export sale irrespective of whether the obligor is located in the country to which the export sale is destined.

    (h) __Conditions for fish and processed fish products__ 

        In making available any guarantees of credit under this section in connection with sales of fish and processed fish products, the Secretary shall make such guarantees available under terms and conditions that are comparable to the terms and conditions that apply to guarantees provided with respect to sales of other agricultural commodities under this section.

    (i) __Processed and high-value products__

    (j) __Consultation on agricultural export credit programs__ 

        The Secretary and the United States Trade Representative shall consult on a regular basis with the Committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on International Relations, of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on the status of multilateral negotiations regarding agricultural export credit programs.

        (1) __Definition of long term__ 

            In this subsection, the term “long term” means a period of 10 or more years.

        (2) __Guarantees__ 

        In administering the export credit guarantees authorized under this section, the Secretary shall—

            (A) maximize the export sales of agricultural commodities;

            (B) maximize the export credit guarantees that are made available and used during the course of a fiscal year;

            (C) develop an approach to risk evaluation that facilitates accurate country risk designations and timely adjustments to the designations (on an ongoing basis) in response to material changes in country risk conditions, with ongoing opportunity for input and evaluation from the private sector;

            (D) adjust risk-based guarantees as necessary to ensure program effectiveness and United States competitiveness; and

>                 “(i) the economic effects of the foreign debt burden of each recipient country, and in particular the economic effects on each recipient country of the credits for which repayment is guaranteed under subsection (a); and

>                 “(ii) the relationship between any negative economic effects on any recipient country caused by its overall foreign debt burden and debt incurred under subsection (a) and such country’s political stability.

>     “(f) __Emerging Market.—__ 

>     In this section and section 1543 \[[7 U.S.C. 3293][/us/usc/t7/s3293]\], the term ‘emerging market’ means any country that the Secretary determines—

>         “(1) is taking steps toward a market-oriented economy through the food, agriculture, or rural business sectors of the economy of the country; and

>         “(2) has the potential to provide a viable and significant market for United States agricultural commodities or products of United States agricultural commodities.”
