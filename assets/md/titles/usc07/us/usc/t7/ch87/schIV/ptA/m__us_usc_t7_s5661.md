## § 5661. Program controls for export programs

    (a) __Arrival certification__ 

        With respect to a commodity provided, or for which financing or a credit guarantee or other assistance is made available, under a program authorized in section 5621 or 5622 of this title, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall require the exporter of the commodity to maintain records of an official or customary commercial nature or other documents as the Secretary may require, and shall allow representatives of the Commodity Credit Corporation access to the records or documents as needed, to verify the arrival of the commodity in the country that is the intended destination of the commodity.

    (b) __Diversion__ 

        The unauthorized diversion of commodities under the programs authorized in sections 5621 and 5622 of this title is prohibited. The Commodity Credit Corporation shall establish procedures providing for the annual audit of a sufficient number of export transactions under such programs to ensure that the agricultural commodities that were the subject of such transactions arrived in the country of destination as provided in the sales agreement.

    (c) __Good faith__ 

        The failure of an exporter, seller or other person to comply with the provisions of this section shall not affect the validity of any credit guarantee or other obligation of the Commodity Credit Corporation under the programs under this chapter with respect to any exporter, seller, or person who had no knowledge of such failure to comply at the time such exporter, seller, or person was assigned the credit guarantee or at the time the Corporation entered into such obligation.
