        Any funds in the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund or the No Net Cost Tobacco Account of an association established under sections 106A and 106B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 ([7 U.S.C. 1445–1][/us/usc/t7/s1445–1], 1445–2) that remain after the application of subsections (b) and (c) shall be transferred to the association for distribution to producers of quota tobacco in accordance with a plan approved by the Secretary.
