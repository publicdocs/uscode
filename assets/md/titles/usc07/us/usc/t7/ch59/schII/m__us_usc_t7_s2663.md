    (a) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.

    (b) __Distributions__ 

    Such sums as are appropriated to carry out the provisions of section 2662(a) and (b) of this title shall be distributed by the Secretary of Agriculture as follows:

        (1) 4 per centum shall be retained by the Secretary for program administration and national coordination of State programs, and program assistance to the States;

        (2) 10 per centum shall be used to finance work serving two or more States in which colleges or universities in two or more States cooperate or that is conducted by one college or university to serve two or more States;

        (3) 20 per centum shall be allocated equally among the States; and

        (4) 66 per centum shall be allocated to each State as follows: One-half in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allotted as the rural population of the State bears to the total rural population of all the States, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at that time; and one-half in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allotted as the farm population of the State bears to the total farm population of all the States, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at that time:

        Provided, That, beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, no State may receive more than $75,000 until all States have been allotted a minimum of $75,000.

    (c) __Additional distributions__ 

        Such sums as are appropriated to carry out subsections (e) and (i) of [section 2662 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2662] shall be distributed by the Secretary to colleges and universities, on a competitive or matching fund basis, according to the Secretary’s determination of the projects and manner of funding that show the most promise of fulfilling the objectives of those subsections.

    (d) __Administration of programs__ 

        Funds appropriated under this subchapter may be used to pay salaries and other expenses of personnel employed to carry out the functions authorized by this subchapter; to obtain necessary supplies, equipment, and services; and to rent, repair, and maintain facilities needed, but not to purchase or construct buildings.

    (e) __Development of plans of work and budgets by eligible institutions__ 

        Payment of funds to any State for programs authorized under section 2662(a), (b), (c), and (d) of this title shall be contingent upon approval by the Secretary of a plan of work and budget for such programs and compliance with such regulations as the Secretary may issue under this subchapter. Plans for work shall be jointly developed in each State by the land-grant colleges and universities eligible to receive funds under the Act of July 2, 1862 ([7 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t7/s301] et seq.), and the Act of August 30, 1890 ([7 U.S.C. 321][/us/usc/t7/s321] et seq.), including Tuskegee Institute.
