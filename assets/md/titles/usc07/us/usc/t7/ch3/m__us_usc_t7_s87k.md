## § 87k. Standardizing commercial inspections

    (a) __Testing equipment__ 

    To promote greater uniformity in commercial grain inspection results, the Secretary may work in conjunction with the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the National Conference on Weights and Measures, or other appropriate governmental, scientific, or technical organizations to—

        (1) identify inspection instruments requiring standardization under subsection (b);

        (2) establish performance criteria for commercial grain inspection instruments;

        (3) develop a national program to approve grain inspection instruments for commercial inspection; and

        (4) develop standard reference materials or other means necessary for calibration or testing of approved instruments.

    (b) __General inspection procedures__ 

        To ensure that producers are treated uniformly in delivering grain, the Secretary shall develop practical and cost-effective procedures for conducting commercial inspections of grain with respect to the application of quality factors, that result in premiums and discounts. The procedures shall be made available to country elevators and others making first-point-of-delivery inspections.

    (c) __Inspection services and information__ 

        To encourage the use of equipment and procedures developed in accordance with subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary shall provide for official inspection services by the Secretary, States, and official inspection agencies and provide information on the proper use of sampling and inspection equipment, application of the grain standards, and availability of official inspection services, including appeals under this chapter.

    (d) __Standardized aflatoxin equipment and procedures__ 

    The Secretary shall—

        (1) establish uniform standards for testing equipment; and

        (2) establish uniform testing procedures and sampling techniques;

        that may be used by processors, refiners, operators of grain elevators and terminals, and others to accurately detect the level of aflatoxin contamination of corn in the United States.
