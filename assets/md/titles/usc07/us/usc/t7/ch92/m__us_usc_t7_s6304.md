## § 6304. Required terms in orders

    (a) __In general__ 

        Any order issued under this chapter shall contain the terms and conditions specified in this section.

    (b) __Establishment and membership of United Soybean Board__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The order shall provide for the establishment of, and appointment of members to, a United Soybean Board to administer the order. Members of the Board shall be soybean producers appointed by the Secretary, on a geographic basis, from State or combined units, as provided in this subsection. The cumulative number of seats on the Board shall be the total number of seats to which all the units are entitled.

        (2) __Seats__ 

        The Secretary shall establish State units and combined units and seats on the Board for such units, as follows:

            (A) __State units__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each State shall be considered as a unit.

            (B) __Combined units__ 

                A State in which average annual soybean production is less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States into a combined unit. To the extent practicable, each State with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels into a combined unit, in a manner prescribed in the order, and each combined unit shall consist of geographically contiguous States. To the extent practicable, each combined unit shall have an average annual production of soybeans of at least 3,000,000 bushels.

            (C) __Number of seats per unit__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (F), each unit, as established under subparagraph (A) or (B)—

                (i) if its average annual soybean production is less than 15,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to one seat on the Board;

                (ii) if its average annual soybean production is 15,000,000 bushels or more but less than 70,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to 2 seats on the Board;

                (iii) if its average annual soybean production is 70,000,000 bushels or more but less than 200,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to 3 seats on the Board; and

                (iv) if its average annual soybean production is 200,000,000 bushels or more, shall be entitled to 4 seats on the Board.

            (D) __Determination of average annual soybean production__ 

                For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (F), the Secretary shall determine average annual soybean production applicable to a crop year by using the average of the 5 previous crops of soybeans, excluding the crop in which production was the highest and the crop in which production was the lowest.

            (E) __Reapportionment of seats__ 

                At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Secretary, if necessary, shall adjust any unit to conform with subparagraphs (A) and (B). If the Secretary makes such an adjustment, the Secretary shall reapportion the seats on the Board to conform with subparagraph (C) and any modifications made under subparagraph (F). If payment of refunds following the initial referendum conducted under [section 6305(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6305/a] is authorized by producers, in making such adjustments, the Secretary shall exclude, from each State’s annual soybean production, those bushels of soybeans on which such refunds are paid.

            (F) __Adjustment of levels of production__ 

                At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Board may recommend to the Secretary, to the extent it determines appropriate, changes in the levels of production used in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to determine per-unit representation on the Board. The Secretary may amend the order to make such changes in levels of production used to determine per-unit representation. Any such amendment to the order shall not be subject to a referendum of producers. A unit may not, as a result of any modification under this subparagraph, lose Board seats to which it is entitled at the time the order is initially issued unless its average annual production, as determined under subparagraph (D), declines below the levels required for representation, as specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).

        (3) __Nominations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall appoint soybean producers to seats established under paragraph (2) from nominations submitted by each unit. Each unit shall submit to the Secretary at least two nominations for each appointment to the Board to which the unit is entitled, as determined under paragraph (2).

            (B) __Method for obtaining nominations__ 

                (i) __Initially-established Board__ 

                    (I) __State units__ 

                        The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each seat on the initially-established Board to which a State unit is entitled from the State soybean board in the State that submits satisfactory evidence to the Secretary that such board meets the criteria of subparagraph (A) or (B) of [section 6302(14) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6302/14]. If no such organization exists in the unit, the Secretary shall solicit nominations for appointments in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.

                    (II) __Combined units__ 

                        The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each seat on the initially-established Board to which a combined unit is entitled in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the recommendations of any State soybean board operating in the unit that submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that such board meets the criteria described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of [section 6302(14) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6302/14].

                (ii) __Subsequent appointment__ 

                    (I) __State units__ 

                        Nominations for each subsequent appointment to a seat on the Board to which a State unit is entitled shall be made by the qualified State soybean board in the unit. If no such organization exists in the unit, the Secretary shall solicit nominations for such appointment in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.

                    (II) __Combined units__ 

                        The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each subsequent appointment to the Board to which a combined unit is entitled in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the recommendations of any qualified State soybean board operating in the unit.

                (iii) __Rejection__ 

                    The Secretary may reject any nomination submitted by a unit under this paragraph. If there are insufficient nominations from which to appoint members to the Board as a result of the Secretary rejecting the nominations submitted by a unit, the unit shall submit additional nominations, as provided in this paragraph.

        (4) __Terms__ 

            Each appointment to the Board shall be for a term of 3 years, except that appointments to the initially-established Board shall be proportionately for 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year terms. No person may serve more than three consecutive 3-year terms.

Each such temporary member shall be appointed for a single term not to exceed 3 years.

            (B) __Representation of certain States__ 

                The Secretary shall make temporary appointments to the initially-established Board to ensure, to the extent practicable, that each State with a State soybean board that, prior to November 28, 1990, was contributing State soybean promotion and research assessment funds to national soybean promotion and research efforts has representation on the initially-established Board that reflects the relative contributions of such State to the national soybean promotion and research effort.
