            (A) study, to the extent practicable, agricultural production systems that are located in areas that possess various soil, climate, and physical characteristics;

            (B) study farms that have been, and will continue to be, managed using farm production practices that rely on low-input and conservation practices;

            (C) take advantage of the experience and expertise of farmers and ranchers through their direct participation and leadership in projects;

            (D) transfer practical, reliable and timely information to farmers and ranchers concerning low-input sustainable farming practices and systems; and
