([Pub. L. 99–198, title XVI, § 1620][/us/pl/99/198/s1620], Dec. 23, 1985, [99 Stat. 1614][/us/stat/99/1614]; [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (c)(3)(B)(i), (iv), was in the original “this title” and was translated as reading “this subtitle”, meaning subtitle B of title XVI of [Pub. L. 99–198][/us/pl/99/198], which enacted this chapter, as the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—Subsecs. (c)(2)(A), (e). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
