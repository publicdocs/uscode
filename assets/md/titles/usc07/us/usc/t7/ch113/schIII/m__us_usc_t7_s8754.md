        (2) __Availability of partial payments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If, before the end of the 12-month marketing year, the Secretary estimates that counter-cyclical payments will be required under this section for a crop year, the Secretary shall give producers on a farm the option to receive partial payments of the counter-cyclical payment projected to be made for the crop.
