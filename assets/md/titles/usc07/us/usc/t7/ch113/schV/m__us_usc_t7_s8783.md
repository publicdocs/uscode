            (A) in the case of an inadvertent failure, twice the amount of the payment made by the Secretary under this section to the producer of the oilseeds; and

            (B) in any other case, up to twice the full value of the oilseeds involved.

        (3) __Documentation__ 

            The Secretary may require such assurances and documentation as may be needed to enforce the guarantee.
