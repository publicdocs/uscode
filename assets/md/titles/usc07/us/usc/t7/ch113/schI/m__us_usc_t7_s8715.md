## § 8715. Average crop revenue election program

    (a) __Availability and election of alternative approach__ 

        (1) __Availability of average crop revenue election payments__ 

            As an alternative to receiving counter-cyclical payments under section 8714 or 8754 of this title and in exchange for a 20-percent reduction in direct payments under section 8713 or 8753 of this title and a 30-percent reduction in marketing assistance loan rates under section 8732 or 8757 of this title, with respect to all covered commodities and peanuts on a farm, during each of the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 crop years, the Secretary shall give the producers on the farm an opportunity to make an irrevocable election to instead receive average crop revenue election (referred to in this section as “ACRE”) payments under this section for the initial crop year for which the election is made through the 2012 crop year.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The total number of planted acres for which the producers on a farm may receive ACRE payments under this section may not exceed the total base acreage for all covered commodities and peanuts on the farm.

            (B) __Election__ 

                If the total number of planted acres to all covered commodities and peanuts of the producers on a farm exceeds the total base acreage of the farm, the producers on the farm may choose which planted acres to enroll in the program under this section.

            Within the time period and in the manner prescribed pursuant to paragraph (3), all of the producers on a farm shall submit to the Secretary notice of an election made under paragraph (1).

        (5) __Effect of failure to make election__ 

            If all of the producers on a farm fail to make an election under paragraph (1), make different elections under paragraph (1), or fail to timely notify the Secretary of the election made, as required by paragraph (4), all of the producers on the farm shall be deemed to have made the election to receive counter-cyclical payments under section 8714 or 8754 of this title for all covered commodities and peanuts on the farm, and to otherwise not have made the election described in paragraph (1), for the applicable crop years.

    (b) __Payments required__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of producers on a farm who make an election under subsection (a) to receive ACRE payments for any of the 2009 through 2012 crop years for all covered commodities and peanuts, the Secretary shall make ACRE payments available to the producers on a farm in accordance with this subsection.

            (B) __Individual loss__ 

            The Secretary shall make ACRE payments available to the producers on a farm in a State for a crop year only if (as determined by the Secretary)—

                (i) the actual farm revenue for the crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts, as determined under subsection (e); is less than

                (ii) the farm ACRE benchmark revenue for the crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts, as determined under subsection (f).

        (3) __Time for payments__ 

            In the case of each of the 2009 through 2012 crop years, the Secretary shall make ACRE payments beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the covered commodity or peanuts.

    (c) __Actual State revenue__

            (B) the number of acres that are planted to the covered commodity or peanuts in the State during the crop year.

        (3) __National average market price__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the national average market price for a crop year for a covered commodity or peanuts in a State shall equal the greater of—

            (A) the national average market price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the covered commodity or peanuts, as determined by the Secretary; or

            (B) the marketing assistance loan rate for the covered commodity or peanuts under section 8732 or 8757 of this title, as reduced under subsection (a)(1).

    (d) __ACRE program guarantee__ 

        (1) __Amount__ 

            (A) __In general__

                For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(i), subject to subparagraph (B), the benchmark State yield for each planted acre for a crop year for a covered commodity or peanuts in a State shall equal the average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity or peanuts in the State for the most recent 5 crop year yields, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest yields, using National Agricultural Statistics Service data.

            (B) __Assigned yield__ 

            If the Secretary cannot establish the benchmark State yield for each planted acre for a crop year for a covered commodity or peanuts in a State in accordance with subparagraph (A) or if the yield determined under subparagraph (A) is an unrepresentative average yield for the State (as determined by the Secretary), the Secretary shall assign a benchmark State yield for each planted acre for the crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts in the State on the basis of—

                (i) previous average yields for a period of 5 crop years, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and lowest yields; or

                (ii) benchmark State yields for planted acres for the crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts in similar States.
