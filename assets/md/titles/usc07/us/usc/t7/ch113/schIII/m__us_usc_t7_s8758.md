## § 8758. Adjustments of loans

    (a) __Adjustment authority__ 

        The Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the loan rates for peanuts for differences in grade, type, quality, location, and other factors.

    (b) __Manner of adjustment__ 

        The adjustments under subsection (a) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be made in such a manner that the average loan level for peanuts will, on the basis of the anticipated incidence of the factors, be equal to the level of support determined in accordance with this subchapter and subtitles B, D, and E.

    (c) __Adjustment on county basis__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may establish loan rates for a crop of peanuts for producers in individual counties in a manner that results in the lowest loan rate being 95 percent of the national average loan rate, if those loan rates do not result in an increase in outlays.

        (2) __Prohibition__ 

            Adjustments under this subsection shall not result in an increase in the national average loan rate for any year.
