        (2)

         a rate (as determined by the Secretary) that—

            (A) is calculated based on average market prices for the loan commodity during the preceding 30-day period; and

            (B) will minimize discrepancies in marketing loan benefits across State boundaries and across county boundaries; or

        (3)

         a rate that the Secretary may develop using alternative methods for calculating a repayment rate for a loan commodity that the Secretary determines will—

            (B) minimize the accumulation of stocks of the commodity by the Federal Government;

            (C) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing the commodity;

                    (II) the forward-crop price quotation is the lowest such quotation available.
