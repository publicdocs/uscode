## § 6614. Action plan implementation

    (a) __In general__ 

        Action plans shall be implemented, insofar as practicable, to upgrade existing industries to use natural resources more efficiently and to expand the economic base of rural communities so as to alleviate or reduce their dependence on National Forest System land resources.

    (b) __Assistance__ 

        To implement action plans, the Secretary may make grants and enter into cooperative agreements and contracts to provide necessary technical and related assistance. Such grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts may be with the affected rural community, State and local governments, universities, corporations, and other persons.

    (c) __Limitation__ 

        The Federal contribution to the overall implementation of an action plan shall not exceed 80 percent of the total cost of the plan, including administrative and other costs. In calculating the Federal contribution, the Secretary shall take into account the fair market value of equipment, personnel, and services provided.

    (d) __Available authority__ 

        The Secretary may use the Secretary’s authority under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 ([16 U.S.C. 2101][/us/usc/t16/s2101] et seq.) and other Federal, State, and local governmental authorities in implementing action plans.

    (e) __Consistency with forest plans__ 

        The implementation of action plans shall be consistent with land and resource management plans.
