## § 511s. Grading of tobacco

    (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than March 31, 2002, the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) shall conduct referenda among producers of each kind of tobacco that is eligible for price support under the Agricultural Act of 1949 ([7 U.S.C. 1421][/us/usc/t7/s1421] et seq.) to determine whether such producers favor the mandatory grading of that kind of tobacco by the Secretary.

    (2) __Mandatory grading__ 

        (A) __In general__ 

            If the Secretary determines that mandatory grading is favored by a majority of the producers of a kind of tobacco voting in the referendum, the Secretary is authorized and directed to ensure that the kind of tobacco is graded at the time of sale effective for the 2002 and subsequent marketing years.

        (B) __Fees__ 

            To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall establish, collect, and use fees for the grading of tobacco required under this section in the same manner as user fees for the grading of tobacco sold at auction authorized under the Tobacco Inspection Act ([7 U.S.C. 511][/us/usc/t7/s511] et seq.).

    (3) __Judicial review__ 

        A determination by the Secretary under this section shall not be subject to judicial review.
