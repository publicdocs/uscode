## § 136w–8. Pesticide registration service fees

    (a) __Definition of costs__ 

    In this section, the term “costs”, when used with respect to review and decisionmaking pertaining to an application for which registration service fees are paid under this section, means—

        (1)

         costs to the extent that—

            (A) officers and employees provide direct support for the review and decisionmaking for covered pesticide applications, associated tolerances, and corresponding risk and benefits information and analyses;

            (B) persons and organizations under contract with the Administrator engage in the review of the applications, and corresponding risk and benefits information and assessments; and

            (C) advisory committees and other accredited persons or organizations, on the request of the Administrator, engage in the peer review of risk or benefits information associated with covered pesticide applications;

        (2) costs of management of information, and the acquisition, maintenance, and repair of computer and telecommunication resources (including software), used to support review of pesticide applications, associated tolerances, and corresponding risk and benefits information and analyses; and

        (3) costs of collecting registration service fees under subsections (b) and (c) and reporting, auditing, and accounting under this section.

    (b) __Fees__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Effective beginning on the effective date of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003, the Administrator shall assess and collect covered pesticide registration service fees in accordance with this section.

        (2) __Covered pesticide registration applications__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                An application for the registration of a pesticide covered by this subchapter that is received by the Administrator on or after the effective date of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 shall be subject to a registration service fee under this section.

            (B) __Existing applications__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), an application for the registration of a pesticide that was submitted to the Administrator before the effective date of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 and is pending on that effective date shall be subject to a service fee under this section if the application is for the registration of a new active ingredient that is not listed in the Registration Division 2003 Work Plan of the Office of Pesticide Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency.

                (ii) __Tolerance or exemption fees__ 

                    The amount of any fee otherwise payable for an application described in clause (i) under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any fees paid to support the related petition for a pesticide tolerance or exemption under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ([21 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t21/s301] et seq.).

            (C) __Documentation__ 

            An application subject to a registration service fee under this section shall be submitted with documentation certifying—

                (i) payment of the registration service fee; or

                (ii) payment of at least 25 percent of the registration service fee and a request for a waiver from or reduction of the remaining amount of the registration service fee.

            (D) __Payment__ 

                The registration service fee required under this subsection shall be due upon submission of the application.

            (E) __Applications subject to additional fees__ 

            An application may be subject to additional fees if—

                (i) the applicant identified the incorrect registration service fee and decision review period;

                (ii) after review of a waiver request, the Administrator denies the waiver request; or

                (iii) after review of the application, the Administrator determines that a different registration service fee and decision review period apply to the application.

            (F) __Effect of failure to pay fees__ 

                The Administrator shall reject any application submitted without the required registration service fee.

            (G) __Non-refundable portion of fees__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Administrator shall retain 25 percent of the applicable registration service fee.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    Any waiver, refund, credit or other reduction in the registration service fee shall not exceed 75 percent of the registration service fee.

            (H) __Collection of unpaid fees__ 

                In any case in which the Administrator does not receive payment of a registration service fee (or applicable portion of the registration service fee) by the date that is 30 days after the fee is due, the fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.

        (3) __Schedule of covered applications and registration service fees__ 

            Subject to paragraph (6), the schedule of covered pesticide registration applications and corresponding registration service fees shall be as follows:

            (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant’s initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first food use application.

            (3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency. The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant’s written or electronic confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time. Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c) containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application. Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant’s initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the new use application.

The application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant’s initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first food use application.

        (5) The scientific data involved in this category are complex. EPA often seeks technical advice from the Scientific Advisory Panel on risks that pesticides pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide applicators, non-target species, as well as insect resistance, and novel scientific issues surrounding new technologies. The scientists of the SAP neither make nor recommend policy decisions. They provide advice on the science used to make these decisions. Their advice is invaluable to the EPA as it strives to protect humans and the environment from risks posed by pesticides. Due to the time it takes to schedule and prepare for meetings with the SAP, additional time and costs are needed.

The uncertainty of these risks may reduce the allowable acreage, based upon the quantity and type of non-target organism data submitted and the lack of insect resistance management data, which is usually not required for seed-increase registrations.

        (4) __Pending pesticide registration applications__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                An applicant that submitted a registration application to the Administrator before the effective date of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003, but that is not required to pay a registration service fee under paragraph (2)(B), may, on a voluntary basis, pay a registration service fee in accordance with paragraph (2)(B).

            (B) __Voluntary fee__ 

                The Administrator may not compel payment of a registration service fee for an application described in subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Documentation__ 

            An application for which a voluntary registration service fee is paid under this paragraph shall be submitted with documentation certifying—

                (i) payment of the registration service fee; or

                (ii) a request for a waiver from or reduction of the registration service fee.

        (5) __Resubmission of pesticide registration applications__ 

            If a pesticide registration application is submitted by a person that paid the fee for the application under paragraph (2), is determined by the Administrator to be complete, and is not approved or is withdrawn (without a waiver or refund), the submission of the same pesticide registration application by the same person (or a licensee, assignee, or successor of the person) shall not be subject to a fee under paragraph (2).

        (6) __Fee adjustment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Effective for a covered pesticide registration application received during the period beginning on October 1, 2013, and ending on September 30, 2015, the Administrator shall increase by 5 percent the registration service fee payable for the application under paragraph (3).

            (B) __Additional adjustment__ 

                Effective for a covered pesticide registration application received on or after October 1, 2015, the Administrator shall increase by an additional 5 percent the registration service fee in effect as of September 30, 2015.

            (C) __Publication__ 

                The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the revised registration service fee schedules.

        (7) __Waivers and reductions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                An applicant for a covered pesticide registration may request the Administrator to waive or reduce the amount of a registration service fee payable under this section under the circumstances described in subparagraphs (D) through (G).

            (B) __Documentation__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A request for a waiver from or reduction of the registration service fee shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation demonstrating the basis for the waiver or reduction.

                (ii) __Certification__ 

                    The applicant shall provide to the Administrator a written certification, signed by a responsible officer, that the documentation submitted to support the waiver or reduction request is accurate.

                (iii) __Inaccurate documentation__ 

                An application shall be subject to the applicable registration service fee payable under paragraph (3) if, at any time, the Administrator determines that—

                    (I) the documentation supporting the waiver or reduction request is not accurate; or

                    (II) based on the documentation or any other information, the waiver or reduction should not have been granted or should not be granted.

            (C) __Determination to grant or deny request__ 

            As soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days, after the date on which the Administrator receives a request for a waiver or reduction of a registration service fee under this paragraph, the Administrator shall—

                (i) determine whether to grant or deny the request; and

                (ii) notify the applicant of the determination.

            (D) __Minor uses__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Administrator may exempt from, or waive a portion of, the registration service fee for an application for minor uses for a pesticide.

                (ii) __Supporting documentation__ 

                    An applicant requesting a waiver or exemption under this subparagraph shall provide supporting documentation that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that anticipated revenues from the uses that are the subject of the application would be insufficient to justify imposition of the full application fee.

            (E) __IR–4 exemption__ 

            The Administrator shall exempt an application from the registration service fee if the Administrator determines that—

                (i) the application is solely associated with a tolerance petition submitted in connection with the Inter-Regional Project Number 4 (IR–4) as described in [section 2 of Public Law 89–106][/us/pl/89/106/s2] ([7 U.S.C. 450i(e)][/us/usc/t7/s450i/e]); and

                (ii) the exemption is in the public interest.

            (F) __Small businesses__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Administrator shall waive 50 percent of the registration service fees payable by an entity for a covered pesticide registration application under this section if the entity is a small business (as defined in [section 136a–1(i)(1)(E)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a–1/i/1/E/ii]) at the time of application.

                (ii) __Waiver of fees__ 

                The Administrator shall waive 75 percent of the registration service fees payable by an entity under this section if the entity—
