    (a) __In general__ 

    For the purposes of this subchapter, a State shall have primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations during any period for which the Administrator determines that such State—

        (2) has adopted and is implementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of such State laws and regulations; and

        (3) will keep such records and make such reports showing compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection as the Administrator may require by regulation.

    (b) __Special rules__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any State that enters into a cooperative agreement with the Administrator under [section 136u of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136u] for the enforcement of pesticide use restrictions shall have the primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations. Any State that has a plan approved by the Administrator in accordance with the requirements of [section 136i of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136i] that the Administrator determines meets the criteria set out in subsection (a) of this section shall have the primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations.
