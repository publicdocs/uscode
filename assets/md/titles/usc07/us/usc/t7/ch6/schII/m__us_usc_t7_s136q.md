## § 136q. Storage, disposal, transportation, and recall

    (a) __Storage, disposal, and transportation__ 

        (1) __Data requirements and registration of pesticides__ 

        The Administrator may require under section 136a or 136d of this title that—

            (A) the registrant or applicant for registration of a pesticide submit or cite data or information regarding methods for the safe storage and disposal of excess quantities of the pesticide to support the registration or continued registration of a pesticide;

            (B) the labeling of a pesticide contain requirements and procedures for the transportation, storage, and disposal of the pesticide, any container of the pesticide, any rinsate containing the pesticide, or any other material used to contain or collect excess or spilled quantities of the pesticide; and

            (C) the registrant of a pesticide provide evidence of sufficient financial and other resources to carry out a recall plan under subsection (b), and provide for the disposition of the pesticide, in the event of suspension and cancellation of the pesticide.

        (2) __Pesticides__ 

        The Administrator may by regulation, or as part of an order issued under [section 136d of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d] or an amendment to such an order—

            (A) issue requirements and procedures to be followed by any person who stores or transports a pesticide the registration of which has been suspended or canceled;

            (B) issue requirements and procedures to be followed by any person who disposes of stocks of a pesticide the registration of which has been suspended; and

            (C) issue requirements and procedures for the disposal of any pesticide the registration of which has been canceled.

        (3) __Containers, rinsates, and other materials__ 

        The Administrator may by regulation, or as part of an order issued under [section 136d of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d] or an amendment to such an order—

            (A) issue requirements and procedures to be followed by any person who stores or transports any container of a pesticide the registration of which has been suspended or canceled, any rinsate containing the pesticide, or any other material used to contain or collect excess or spilled quantities of the pesticide;

            (B) issue requirements and procedures to be followed by any person who disposes of stocks of any container of a pesticide the registration of which has been suspended, any rinsate containing the pesticide, or any other material used to contain or collect excess or spilled quantities of the pesticide; and

            (C) issue requirements and procedures for the disposal of any container of a pesticide the registration of which has been canceled, any rinsate containing the pesticide, or any other material used to contain or collect excess or spilled quantities of the pesticide.

        (4) __Container recycling__ 

            The Secretary may promulgate a regulation for the return and recycling of disposable pesticide containers used for the distribution or sale of registered pesticide products in interstate commerce. Any such regulation requiring recycling of disposable pesticide containers shall not apply to antimicrobial pesticides (as defined in [section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136]) or other pesticide products intended for non-agricultural uses.

    (b) __Recalls__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the registration of a pesticide has been suspended and canceled under [section 136d of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d], and if the Administrator finds that recall of the pesticide is necessary to protect health or the environment, the Administrator shall order a recall of the pesticide in accordance with this subsection.

        (2) __Voluntary recall__ 

            If, after determining under paragraph (1) that a recall is necessary, the Administrator finds that voluntary recall by the registrant and others in the chain of distribution may be as safe and effective as a mandatory recall, the Administrator shall request the registrant of the pesticide to submit, within 60 days of the request, a plan for the voluntary recall of the pesticide. If such a plan is requested and submitted, the Administrator shall approve the plan and order the registrant to conduct the recall in accordance with the plan unless the Administrator determines, after an informal hearing, that the plan is inadequate to protect health or the environment.

        (3) __Mandatory recall__ 

            If, after determining under paragraph (1) that a recall is necessary, the Administrator does not request the submission of a plan under paragraph (2) or finds such a plan to be inadequate, the Administrator shall issue a regulation that prescribes a plan for the recall of the pesticide. A regulation issued under this paragraph may apply to any person who is or was a registrant, distributor, or seller of the pesticide, or any successor in interest to such a person.

        (4) __Recall procedure__ 

        A regulation issued under this subsection may require any person that is subject to the regulation to—

            (A) arrange to make available one or more storage facilities to receive and store the pesticide to which the recall program applies, and inform the Administrator of the location of each such facility;

            (B) accept and store at such a facility those existing stocks of such pesticide that are tendered by any other person who obtained the pesticide directly or indirectly from the person that is subject to such regulation;

            (C) on the request of a person making such a tender, provide for proper transportation of the pesticide to a storage facility; and

            (D) take such reasonable steps as the regulation may prescribe to inform persons who may be holders of the pesticide of the terms of the recall regulation and how those persons may tender the pesticide and arrange for transportation of the pesticide to a storage facility.

        (5) __Contents of recall plan__ 

        A recall plan established under this subsection shall include—

            (A) the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, and a schedule for recall; and

            (B) the means to be used to verify the effectiveness of the recall.

        (6) __Requirements or procedures__ 

            No requirement or procedure imposed in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection (a) may require the recall of existing stocks of the pesticide except as provided by this subsection.

    (c) __Storage costs__ 

        (1) __Submission of plan__ 

            A registrant who wishes to become eligible for reimbursement of storage costs incurred as a result of a recall prescribed under subsection (b) for a pesticide whose registration has been suspended and canceled shall, as soon as practicable after the suspension of the registration of the pesticide, submit to the Administrator a plan for the storage and disposal of the pesticide that meets criteria established by the Administrator by regulation.

        (2) __Reimbursement__ 

        Within a reasonable period of time after such storage costs are incurred and paid by the registrant, the Administrator shall reimburse the registrant, on request, for—

            (A) none of the costs incurred by the registrant before the date of submission of the plan referred to in paragraph (1) to the Administrator;

            (B) 100 percent of the costs incurred by the registrant after the date of submission of the plan to the Administrator or the date of cancellation of the registration of the pesticide, whichever is later, but before the approval of the plan by the Administrator;

            (C) 50 percent of the costs incurred by the registrant during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the approval of the plan by the Administrator or the date of cancellation of the registration of the pesticide, whichever is later;

            (D) none of the costs incurred by the registrant during the 3-year period beginning on the 366th day following approval of the plan by the Administrator or the date of cancellation of the registration of the pesticide, whichever is later; and

            (E) 25 percent of the costs incurred by the registrant during the period beginning on the first day of the 5th year following the date of the approval of the plan by the Administrator or the date of cancellation of the registration of the pesticide, whichever is later, and ending on the date that a disposal permit for the pesticide is issued by a State or an alternative plan for disposal of the pesticide in accordance with applicable law has been developed.

    (d) __Administration of storage, disposal, transportation, and recall programs__ 

        (1) __Voluntary agreements__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing or making unlawful any agreement between a seller and a buyer of any pesticide or other substance regarding the ultimate allocation of the costs of storage, transportation, or disposal of a pesticide.

        (2) __Rule and regulation review__ 

            [Section 136w(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136w/a/4] shall not apply to any regulation issued under subsection (a)(2) or (b).

        (3) __Limitations__ 

            No registrant shall be responsible under this section for a pesticide the registration of which is held by another person. No distributor or seller shall be responsible under this section for a pesticide that the distributor or seller did not hold or sell.

        (4) __Seizure and penalties__ 

            If the Administrator finds that a person who is subject to a regulation or order under subsection (a)(2) or (b) has failed substantially to comply with that regulation or order, the Administrator may take action under section 136k or 136l of this title or obtain injunctive relief under [section 136n(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136n/c] against such person or any successor in interest of any such person.

        (3) __Solid Waste Disposal Act__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall affect the authorities or requirements concerning pesticide containers under the Solid Waste Disposal Act ([42 U.S.C. 6901][/us/usc/t42/s6901]).

    (g) __Pesticide container study__
