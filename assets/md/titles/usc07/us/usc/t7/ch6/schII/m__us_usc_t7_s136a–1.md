## § 136a–1. Reregistration of registered pesticides

    (a) __General rule__ 

    The Administrator shall reregister, in accordance with this section, each registered pesticide containing any active ingredient contained in any pesticide first registered before November 1, 1984, except for any pesticide as to which the Administrator has determined, after November 1, 1984, and before the effective date of this section, that—

        (1) there are no outstanding data requirements; and

        (2) the requirements of [section 136a(c)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/5] have been satisfied.

    (b) __Reregistration phases__ 

    Reregistrations of pesticides under this section shall be carried out in the following phases:

        (1) The first phase shall include the listing under subsection (c) of this section of the active ingredients of the pesticides that will be reregistered.

        (2) The second phase shall include the submission to the Administrator under subsection (d) of this section of notices by registrants respecting their intention to seek reregistration, identification by registrants of missing and inadequate data for such pesticides, and commitments by registrants to replace such missing or inadequate data within the applicable time period.

        (3) The third phase shall include submission to the Administrator by registrants of the information required under subsection (e) of this section.

        (4) The fourth phase shall include an independent, initial review by the Administrator under subsection (f) of this section of submissions under phases two and three, identification of outstanding data requirements, and the issuance, as necessary, of requests for additional data.

        (5) The fifth phase shall include the review by the Administrator under subsection (g) of this section of data submitted for reregistration and appropriate regulatory action by the Administrator.

    (c) __Phase one__ 

        (1) __Priority for reregistration__ 

        For purposes of the reregistration of the pesticides described in subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall list the active ingredients of pesticides and shall give priority to, among others, active ingredients (other than active ingredients for which registration standards have been issued before the effective date of this section) that—

            (A) are in use on or in food or feed and may result in postharvest residues;

            (B) may result in residues of potential toxicological concern in potable ground water, edible fish, or shellfish;

            (C) have been determined by the Administrator before the effective date of this section to have significant outstanding data requirements; or

            (D) are used on crops, including in greenhouses and nurseries, where worker exposure is most likely to occur.

        (2) __Reregistration lists__ 

        For purposes of reregistration under this section, the Administrator shall by order—

            (A) not later than 70 days after the effective date of this section, list pesticide active ingredients for which registration standards have been issued before such effective date;

            (B) not later than 4 months after such effective date, list the first 150 pesticide active ingredients, as determined under paragraph (1);

            (C) not later than 7 months after such effective date, list the second 150 pesticide active ingredients, as determined under paragraph (1); and

            (D) not later than 10 months after such effective date, list the remainder of the pesticide active ingredients, as determined under paragraph (1).

            Each list shall be published in the Federal Register.

        (3) __Judicial review__ 

            The content of a list issued by the Administrator under paragraph (2) shall not be subject to judicial review.

        (4) __Notice to registrants__ 

            On the publication of a list of pesticide active ingredients under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall send by certified mail to the registrants of the pesticides containing such active ingredients a notice of the time by which the registrants are to notify the Administrator under subsection (d) of this section whether the registrants intend to seek or not to seek reregistration of such pesticides.

    (d) __Phase two__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The registrant of a pesticide that contains an active ingredient listed under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (c)(2) of this section shall submit to the Administrator, within the time period prescribed by paragraph (4), the notice described in paragraph (2) and any information, commitment, or offer described in paragraph (3).

        (2) __Notice of intent to seek or not to seek reregistration__ 

            (A) The registrant of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (c)(2) of this section shall notify the Administrator by certified mail whether the registrant intends to seek or does not intend to seek reregistration of the pesticide.

            (B) If a registrant submits a notice under subparagraph (A) of an intention not to seek reregistration of a pesticide, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register stating that such a notice has been submitted.

        (3) __Missing or inadequate data__ 

        Each registrant of a pesticide that contains an active ingredient listed under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (c)(2) of this section and for which the registrant submitted a notice under paragraph (2) of an intention to seek reregistration of such pesticide shall submit to the Administrator—

            (A)

             in accordance with regulations issued by the Administrator under [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a], an identification of—

                (i) all data that are required by regulation to support the registration of the pesticide with respect to such active ingredient;

                (ii) data that were submitted by the registrant previously in support of the registration of the pesticide that are inadequate to meet such regulations; and

                (iii) data identified under clause (i) that have not been submitted to the Administrator; and

            (B)

             either—

                (i) a commitment to replace the data identified under subparagraph (A)(ii) and submit the data identified under subparagraph (A)(iii) within the applicable time period prescribed by paragraph (4)(B); or

                (ii) an offer to share in the cost to be incurred by a person who has made a commitment under clause (i) to replace or submit the data and an offer to submit to arbitration as described by [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] with regard to such cost sharing.

            For purposes of a submission by a registrant under subparagraph (A)(ii), data are inadequate if the data are derived from a study with respect to which the registrant is unable to make the certification prescribed by subsection (e)(1)(G) of this section that the registrant possesses or has access to the raw data used in or generated by such study. For purposes of a submission by a registrant under such subparagraph, data shall be considered to be inadequate if the data are derived from a study submitted before January 1, 1970, unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such data should be considered to support the registration of the pesticide that is to be reregistered.

        (4) __Time periods__ 

            (A)

             A submission under paragraph (2) or (3) shall be made—

                (i) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section, not later than 3 months after the date of publication of the listing of such active ingredient;

                (ii) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section, not later than 3 months after the date of publication of the listing of such active ingredient; and

                (iii) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(D) of this section, not later than 3 months after the date of publication of the listing of such active ingredient.

                On application, the Administrator may extend a time period prescribed by this subparagraph if the Administrator determines that factors beyond the control of the registrant prevent the registrant from complying with such period.

            (B)

             A registrant shall submit data in accordance with a commitment entered into under paragraph (3)(B) within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Administrator, but not more than 48 months after the date the registrant submitted the commitment. The Administrator, on application of a registrant, may extend the period prescribed by the preceding sentence by no more than 2 years if extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the registrant prevent the registrant from submitting data within such prescribed period. Upon application of a registrant, the Administrator shall, in the case of a minor use, extend the deadline for the production of residue chemistry data under this subparagraph for data required solely to support that minor use until the final deadline for submission of data under this section for the other uses of the pesticide established as of August 3, 1996, if—

                (i) the data to support other uses of the pesticide on a food are being provided;

                (ii) the registrant, in submitting a request for such an extension provides a schedule, including interim dates to measure progress, to assure that the data production will be completed before the expiration of the extension period;

                (iii) the Administrator has determined that such extension will not significantly delay the Administrator’s schedule for issuing a reregistration eligibility determination required under this section; and

                (iv) the Administrator has determined that based on existing data, such extension would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. If the Administrator grants an extension under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of the data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with clause (iv) of [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] or other provisions of this section, as appropriate, regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor use and shall inform the public of such action. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, the Administrator may take action to modify or revoke the extension under this subparagraph if the Administrator determines that the extension for the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In such circumstance, the Administrator shall provide written notice to the registrant revoking the extension of time for submission of data. Such data shall instead be due in accordance with the date then established by the Administrator for submission of the data.

        (5) __Cancellation and removal__ 

            (A) If the registrant of a pesticide does not submit a notice under paragraph (2) or (3) within the time prescribed by paragraph (4)(A), the Administrator shall issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration of such registrant for such pesticide and shall publish the notice in the Federal Register and allow 60 days for the submission of comments on the notice. On expiration of such 60 days, the Administrator, by order and without a hearing, may cancel the registration or take such other action, including extension of applicable time periods, as may be necessary to enable reregistration of such pesticide by another person.

            (B)

                (i)

                 If—

                    (I) no registrant of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2) of this section notifies the Administrator under paragraph (2) that the registrant intends to seek reregistration of any pesticide containing that active ingredient;

                    (II) no such registrant complies with paragraph (3)(A); or

                    (III) no such registrant makes a commitment under paragraph (3)(B) to replace or submit all data described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (3)(A);

                    the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to remove the active ingredient from the list established under subsection (c)(2) of this section and a notice of intent to cancel the registrations of all pesticides containing such active ingredient and shall provide 60 days for comment on such notice.

                (ii)

                 After the 60-day period has expired, the Administrator, by order, may cancel any such registration without hearing, except that the Administrator shall not cancel a registration under this subparagraph if—

                    (I) during the comment period a person acquires the rights of the registrant in that registration;

                    (II) during the comment period that person furnishes a notice of intent to reregister the pesticide in accordance with paragraph (2); and

                    (III) not later than 120 days after the publication of the notice under this subparagraph, that person has complied with paragraph (3) and the fee prescribed by this section has been paid.

        (6) __Suspensions and penalties__ 

            The Administrator shall issue a notice of intent to suspend the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the procedures prescribed by [section 136a(c)(2)(B)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B/iv] if the Administrator determines that (A) progress is insufficient to ensure the submission of the data required for such pesticide under a commitment made under paragraph (3)(B) within the time period prescribed by paragraph (4)(B) or (B) the registrant has not submitted such data to the Administrator within such time period. If the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide, but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support uses of the pesticide on a food, or if all uses of the pesticide are nonfood uses and the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support other nonfood uses of the pesticide, the Administrator, at the written request of the registrant, shall not take any action pursuant to this paragraph in regard to such unsupported minor use until the final deadline established as of August 3, 1996, for the submission of data under this section for the supported uses identified pursuant to this paragraph unless the Administrator determines that the absence of the data is significant enough to cause human health or environmental concerns. On such a determination the Administrator may refuse the request for extension by the registrant. Upon receipt of the request from the registrant, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the receipt of the request and the effective date upon which the uses not being supported will be voluntarily deleted from the registration pursuant to [section 136d(f)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/1]. If the Administrator grants an extension under this paragraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data for the uses being supported and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of such data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with [section 136a(c)(2)(B)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B/iv] regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor and other uses and shall inform the public of such action in accordance with [section 136d(f)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/2]. Notwithstanding this subparagraph, the Administrator may deny, modify, or revoke the temporary extension under this paragraph if the Administrator determines that the continuation of the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In the event of modification or revocation, the Administrator shall provide, in writing, to the registrant a notice revoking the temporary extension and establish a new effective date by which the minor use shall be deleted from the registration.

    (e) __Phase three__ 

        (1) __Information about studies__ 

        Each registrant of a pesticide that contains an active ingredient listed under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (c)(2) of this section who has submitted a notice under subsection (d)(2) of this section of an intent to seek the reregistration of such pesticide shall submit, in accordance with the guidelines issued under paragraph (4), to the Administrator—

            (A) a summary of each study concerning the active ingredient previously submitted by the registrant in support of the registration of a pesticide containing such active ingredient and considered by the registrant to be adequate to meet the requirements of [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a] and the regulations issued under such section;

            (B) a summary of each study concerning the active ingredient previously submitted by the registrant in support of the registration of a pesticide containing such active ingredient that may not comply with the requirements of [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a] and the regulations issued under such section but which the registrant asserts should be deemed to comply with such requirements and regulations;

            (C) a reformat of the data from each study summarized under subparagraph (A) or (B) by the registrant concerning chronic dosing, oncogenicity, reproductive effects, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, or residue chemistry of the active ingredient that were submitted to the Administrator before January 1, 1982;

            (D) where data described in subparagraph (C) are not required for the active ingredient by regulations issued under [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a], a reformat of acute and subchronic dosing data submitted by the registrant to the Administrator before January 1, 1982, that the registrant considers to be adequate to meet the requirements of [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a] and the regulations issued under such section;

            (E) an identification of data that are required to be submitted to the Administrator under [section 136d(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/a/2], indicating an adverse effect of the pesticide;

            (F) an identification of any other information available that in the view of the registrant supports the registration;

            (G) a certification that the registrant or the Administrator possesses or has access to the raw data used in or generated by the studies that the registrant summarized under subparagraph (A) or (B);

            (H)

             either—

                (i) a commitment to submit data to fill each outstanding data requirement identified by the registrant; or

                (ii) an offer to share in the cost of developing such data to be incurred by a person who has made a commitment under clause (i) to submit such data, and an offer to submit to arbitration as described by [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] with regard to such cost sharing; and

            (I) evidence of compliance with section 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title and regulations issued thereunder with regard to previously submitted data as if the registrant were now seeking the original registration of the pesticide.

            A registrant who submits a certification under subparagraph (G) that is false shall be considered to have violated this subchapter and shall be subject to the penalties prescribed by section 136l of this title.

        (2) __Time periods__ 

            (A)

             The information required by paragraph (1) shall be submitted to the Administrator—

                (i) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section, not later than 12 months after the date of publication of the listing of such active ingredient;

            (B)

             A registrant shall submit data in accordance with a commitment entered into under paragraph (1)(H) within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Administrator, but not more than 48 months after the date the registrant submitted the commitment under such paragraph. The Administrator, on application of a registrant, may extend the period prescribed by the preceding sentence by no more than 2 years if extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the registrant prevent the registrant from submitting data within such prescribed period. Upon application of a registrant, the Administrator shall, in the case of a minor use, extend the deadline for the production of residue chemistry data under this subparagraph for data required solely to support that minor use until the final deadline for submission of data under this section for the other uses of the pesticide established as of August 3, 1996, if—

                (i) the data to support other uses of the pesticide on a food are being provided;

                (ii) the registrant, in submitting a request for such an extension provides a schedule, including interim dates to measure progress, to assure that the data production will be completed before the expiration of the extension period;

                (iii) the Administrator has determined that such extension will not significantly delay the Administrator’s schedule for issuing a reregistration eligibility determination required under this section; and

                (iv) the Administrator has determined that based on existing data, such extension would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. If the Administrator grants an extension under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of the data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with clause (iv) of [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] or other provisions of this section, as appropriate, regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor use and shall inform the public of such action. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, the Administrator may take action to modify or revoke the extension under this subparagraph if the Administrator determines that the extension for the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In such circumstance, the Administrator shall provide written notice to the registrant revoking the extension of time for submission of data. Such data shall instead be due in accordance with the date then established by the Administrator for submission of the data.

        (3) __Cancellation__ 

            (A) If the registrant of a pesticide fails to submit the information required by paragraph (1) within the time prescribed by paragraph (2), the Administrator, by order and without hearing, shall cancel the registration of such pesticide. If the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide, but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support uses of the pesticide on a food, or if all uses of the pesticide are nonfood uses and the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support other nonfood uses of the pesticide, the Administrator, at the written request of the registrant, shall not take any action pursuant to this subparagraph in regard to such unsupported minor use until the final deadline established as of August 3, 1996, for the submission of data under this section for the supported uses identified pursuant to this subparagraph unless the Administrator determines that the absence of the data is significant enough to cause human health or environmental concerns. On the basis of such determination, the Administrator may refuse the request for extension by the registrant. Upon receipt of the request from the registrant, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the receipt of the request and the effective date upon which the uses not being supported will be voluntarily deleted from the registration pursuant to [section 136d(f)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/1]. If the Administrator grants an extension under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data for the uses being supported and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of such data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with [section 136a(c)(2)(B)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B/iv] regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor and other uses and shall inform the public of such action in accordance with [section 136d(f)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/2]. Notwithstanding this subparagraph, the Administrator may deny, modify, or revoke the temporary extension under this subparagraph if the Administrator determines that the continuation of the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In the event of modification or revocation, the Administrator shall provide, in writing, to the registrant a notice revoking the temporary extension and establish a new effective date by which the minor use shall be deleted from the registration.

            (B)

                (i) If the registrant of a pesticide submits the information required by paragraph (1) within the time prescribed by paragraph (2) and such information does not conform to the guidelines for submissions established by the Administrator, the Administrator shall determine whether the registrant made a good faith attempt to conform its submission to such guidelines.

                (ii) If the Administrator determines that the registrant made a good faith attempt to conform its submission to such guidelines, the Administrator shall provide the registrant a reasonable period of time to make any necessary changes or corrections.

                (iii)

                    (I) If the Administrator determines that the registrant did not make a good faith attempt to conform its submission to such guidelines, the Administrator may issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration. Such a notice shall be sent to the registrant by certified mail.

                    (II) The registration shall be canceled without a hearing or further notice at the end of 30 days after receipt by the registrant of the notice unless during that time a request for a hearing is made by the registrant.

                    (III) If a hearing is requested, a hearing shall be conducted under [section 136d(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/d], except that the only matter for resolution at the hearing shall be whether the registrant made a good faith attempt to conform its submission to such guidelines. The hearing shall be held and a determination made within 75 days after receipt of a request for hearing.

        (4) __Guidelines__ 

            (A)

             Not later than 1 year after the effective date of this section, the Administrator, by order, shall issue guidelines to be followed by registrants in—

                (i) summarizing studies;

                (ii) reformatting studies;

                (iii) identifying adverse information; and

                (iv) identifying studies that have been submitted previously that may not meet the requirements of [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a] or regulations issued under such section,

                under paragraph (1).

            (B) Guidelines issued under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review.

        (5) __Monitoring__ 

            The Administrator shall monitor the progress of registrants in acquiring and submitting the data required under paragraph (1).

    (f) __Phase four__ 

        (1) __Independent review and identification of outstanding data requirements__ 

            (A) The Administrator shall review the submissions of all registrants of pesticides containing a particular active ingredient under subsections (d)(3) and (e)(1) of this section to determine if such submissions identified all the data that are missing or inadequate for such active ingredient. To assist the review of the Administrator under this subparagraph, the Administrator may require a registrant seeking reregistration to submit complete copies of studies summarized under subsection (e)(1) of this section.

            (B) The Administrator shall independently identify and publish in the Federal Register the outstanding data requirements for each active ingredient that is listed under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (c)(2) of this section and that is contained in a pesticide to be reregistered under this section. The Administrator, at the same time, shall issue a notice under [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] for the submission of the additional data that are required to meet such requirements.

        (2) __Time periods__ 

            (A)

             The Administrator shall take the action required by paragraph (1)—

                (i) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section, not later than 18 months after the date of the listing of such active ingredient;

                (ii) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section, not later than 24 months after the date of the listing of such active ingredient; and

                (iii) in the case of a pesticide containing an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2)(D) of this section, not later than 33 months after the date of the listing of such active ingredient.

            (B)

             If the Administrator issues a notice to a registrant under paragraph (1)(B) for the submission of additional data, the registrant shall submit such data within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Administrator, but not to exceed 48 months after the issuance of such notice. The Administrator, on application of a registrant, may extend the period prescribed by the preceding sentence by no more than 2 years if extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the registrant prevent the registrant from submitting data within such prescribed period. Upon application of a registrant, the Administrator shall, in the case of a minor use, extend the deadline for the production of residue chemistry data under this subparagraph for data required solely to support that minor use until the final deadline for submission of data under this section for the other uses of the pesticide established as of August 3, 1996, if—

                (i) the data to support other uses of the pesticide on a food are being provided;

                (ii) the registrant, in submitting a request for such an extension provides a schedule, including interim dates to measure progress, to assure that the data production will be completed before the expiration of the extension period;

                (iii) the Administrator has determined that such extension will not significantly delay the Administrator’s schedule for issuing a reregistration eligibility determination required under this section; and

                (iv) the Administrator has determined that based on existing data, such extension would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. If the Administrator grants an extension under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of the data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with clause (iv) of [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] or other provisions of this section, as appropriate, regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor use and shall inform the public of such action. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, the Administrator may take action to modify or revoke the extension under this subparagraph if the Administrator determines that the extension for the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In such circumstance, the Administrator shall provide written notice to the registrant revoking the extension of time for submission of data. Such data shall instead be due in accordance with the date then established by the Administrator for submission of the data.

        (3) __Suspensions and penalties__ 

            The Administrator shall issue a notice of intent to suspend the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the procedures prescribed by [section 136a(c)(2)(B)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B/iv] if the Administrator determines that (A) tests necessary to fill an outstanding data requirement for such pesticide have not been initiated within 1 year after the issuance of a notice under paragraph (1)(B), or (B) progress is insufficient to ensure submission of the data referred to in clause (A) within the time period prescribed by paragraph (2)(B) or the required data have not been submitted to the Administrator within such time period. If the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide, but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support uses of the pesticide on a food, or if all uses of the pesticide are nonfood uses and the registrant does not commit to support a specific minor use of the pesticide but is supporting and providing data in a timely and adequate fashion to support other nonfood uses of the pesticide, the Administrator, at the written request of the registrant, shall not take any action pursuant to this paragraph in regard to such unsupported minor use until the final deadline established as of August 3, 1996, for the submission of data under this section for the supported uses identified pursuant to this paragraph unless the Administrator determines that the absence of the data is significant enough to cause human health or environmental concerns. On such a determination the Administrator may refuse the request for extension by the registrant. Upon receipt of the request from the registrant, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the receipt of the request and the effective date upon which the uses not being supported will be voluntarily deleted from the registration pursuant to [section 136d(f)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/1]. If the Administrator grants an extension under this paragraph, the Administrator shall monitor the development of the data for the uses being supported and shall ensure that the registrant is meeting the schedule for the production of such data. If the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting or has not met the schedule for the production of such data, the Administrator may proceed in accordance with [section 136a(c)(2)(B)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B/iv] regarding the continued registration of the affected products with the minor and other uses and shall inform the public of such action in accordance with [section 136d(f)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136d/f/2]. Notwithstanding this subparagraph, the Administrator may deny, modify, or revoke the temporary extension under this paragraph if the Administrator determines that the continuation of the minor use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. In the event of modification or revocation, the Administrator shall provide, in writing, to the registrant a notice revoking the temporary extension and establish a new effective date by which the minor use shall be deleted from the registration.

    (g) __Phase five__ 

        (1) __Data review__ 

            The Administrator shall conduct a thorough examination of all data submitted under this section concerning an active ingredient listed under subsection (c)(2) of this section and of all other available data found by the Administrator to be relevant.

                (ii) for all other active ingredients subject to reregistration under this section, not later than October 3, 2008.

            (B) __Product-specific data.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__ 

                Before reregistering a pesticide, the Administrator shall obtain any needed product-specific data regarding the pesticide by use of [section 136a(c)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/2/B] and shall review such data within 90 days after its submission.

                (ii) __Timing.—__ 

                    (I) __In general.—__ 

                    Subject to subclause (II), the Administrator shall require that data under this subparagraph be submitted to the Administrator not later than 8 months after a determination of eligibility under subparagraph (A) has been made for each active ingredient of the pesticide, unless the Administrator determines that a longer period is required for the generation of the data.

                    (II) __Extraordinary circumstances.—__ 

                    In the case of extraordinary circumstances, the Administrator may provide such a longer period, of not more than 2 additional years, for submission of data to the Administrator under this subparagraph.

            (C) After conducting the review required by paragraph (1) for each active ingredient of a pesticide and the review required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Administrator shall determine whether to reregister a pesticide by determining whether such pesticide meets the requirements of [section 136a(c)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/5]. If the Administrator determines that a pesticide is eligible to be reregistered, the Administrator shall reregister such pesticide within 6 months after the submission of the data concerning such pesticide under subparagraph (B).

            (D) __Determination to not reregister.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__

                (ii) __Timing for regulatory action.—__ 

                Regulatory action under clause (i) shall be completed as expeditiously as possible.

            (E)

             As soon as the Administrator has sufficient information with respect to the dietary risk of a particular active ingredient, but in any event no later than the time the Administrator makes a determination under subparagraph (C) or (D) with respect to pesticides containing a particular active ingredient, the Administrator shall—

                (i) reassess each associated tolerance and exemption from the requirement for a tolerance issued under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ([21 U.S.C. 346a][/us/usc/t21/s346a]);

                (iii) determine whether additional tolerances or exemptions should be issued;

                (iv) publish in the Federal Register a notice setting forth the determinations made under this subparagraph; and

                (v) commence promptly such proceedings under this subchapter and section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \[[21 U.S.C. 346a][/us/usc/t21/s346a]\] as are warranted by such determinations.

    (h) __Compensation of data submitter__ 

        If data that are submitted by a registrant under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section are used to support the application of another person under [section 136a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a], the registrant who submitted such data shall be entitled to compensation for the use of such data as prescribed by section 136a(c)(1)(D) 1 of this title.

                (i) to review and evaluate inert ingredients; and

                (ii)

                 to ensure the expedited processing and review of any application that—

                    (I) proposes the initial or amended registration of an end-use pesticide that, if registered as proposed, would be identical or substantially similar in composition and labeling to a currently-registered pesticide identified in the application, or that would differ in composition and labeling from any such currently-registered pesticide only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;

                    (II) proposes an amendment to the registration of a registered pesticide that does not require scientific review of data; or

                    (III) proposes the initial or amended registration of an end use pesticide that, if registered as proposed, would be used for a public health pesticide.

            (B) Any amounts made available under subparagraph (A) shall be used to obtain sufficient personnel and resources to carry out the activities described in such subparagraph that are in addition to the personnel and resources available to carry out such activities on October 25, 1988.

            (C) So long as the Administrator has not met the time frames specified in clause (ii) of [section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/3/B] with respect to any application subject to [section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/3/B] that was received prior to August 3, 1996, the Administrator shall use the full amount of the fees specified in subparagraph (A) for the purposes specified therein. Once all applications subject to [section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/3/B] that were received prior to August 3, 1996, have been acted upon, no limitation shall be imposed by the preceding sentence of this subparagraph so long as the Administrator meets the time frames specified in clause (ii) of [section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/3/B] on 90 percent of affected applications in a fiscal year. Should the Administrator not meet such time frames in a fiscal year, the limitations imposed by the first sentence of this subparagraph shall apply until all overdue applications subject to [section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s136a/c/3/B] have been acted upon.
