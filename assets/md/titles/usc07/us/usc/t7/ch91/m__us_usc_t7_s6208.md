## § 6208. Investigations and power to subpoena

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary may make such investigations as the Secretary considers necessary—

        (1) for the effective carrying out of the responsibilities of the Secretary under this chapter; or

        (2) to determine whether a person subject to the provisions of this chapter has engaged or is engaging in any act that constitutes a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any order, rule, or regulation issued under this chapter.

    (b) __Power to subpoena__ 

        (1) __Investigations__ 

            For the purpose of an investigation made under subsection (a), the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations and may issue a subpoena to require the production of any records that are relevant to the inquiry. The production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States.

        (2) __Administrative hearings__
