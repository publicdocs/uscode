## § 6517. National List

    (a) __In general__

        (1) __Exemption for prohibited substances in organic production and handling operations__ 

        The National List may provide for the use of substances in an organic farming or handling operation that are otherwise prohibited under this chapter only if—

            (A)

             the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, that the use of such substances—

                (i) would not be harmful to human health or the environment;

                (ii) is necessary to the production or handling of the agricultural product because of the unavailability of wholly natural substitute products; and

                (iii) is consistent with organic farming and handling;

            (B)

             the substance—

                (i) is used in production and contains an active synthetic ingredient in the following categories: copper and sulfur compounds; toxins derived from bacteria; pheromones, soaps, horticultural oils, fish emulsions, treated seed, vitamins and minerals; livestock parasiticides and medicines and production aids including netting, tree wraps and seals, insect traps, sticky barriers, row covers, and equipment cleansers; or

                (ii) is used in production and contains synthetic inert ingredients that are not classified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as inerts of toxicological concern; and

            (C) the specific exemption is developed using the procedures described in subsection (d).

        (2) __Prohibition on the use of specific natural substances__ 

        The National List may prohibit the use of specific natural substances in an organic farming or handling operation that are otherwise allowed under this chapter only if—

            (A)

             the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, that the use of such substances—

                (i) would be harmful to human health or the environment; and

                (ii) is inconsistent with organic farming or handling, and the purposes of this chapter; and

            (B) the specific prohibition is developed using the procedures specified in subsection (d).

    (d) __Procedure for establishing National List__ 

        (1) __In general__

        (2) __No additions__ 

            The Secretary may not include exemptions for the use of specific synthetic substances in the National List other than those exemptions contained in the Proposed National List or Proposed Amendments to the National List.

        (3) __Prohibited substances__ 

            In no instance shall the National List include any substance, the presence of which in food has been prohibited by Federal regulatory action.

        (4) __Notice and comment__ 

            Before establishing the National List or before making any amendments to the National List, the Secretary shall publish the Proposed National List or any Proposed Amendments to the National List in the Federal Register and seek public comment on such proposals. The Secretary shall include in such Notice any changes to such proposed list or amendments recommended by the Secretary.

        (5) __Publication of National List__ 

            After evaluating all comments received concerning the Proposed National List or Proposed Amendments to the National List, the Secretary shall publish the final National List in the Federal Register, along with a discussion of comments received.

        (6) __Expedited petitions for commercially unavailable organic agricultural products constituting less than 5 percent of an organic processed product__

    (e) __Sunset provision__ 

        No exemption or prohibition contained in the National List shall be valid unless the National Organic Standards Board has reviewed such exemption or prohibition as provided in this section within 5 years of such exemption or prohibition being adopted or reviewed and the Secretary has renewed such exemption or prohibition.
