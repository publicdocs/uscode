        (2) selenium at such levels is not safe to the animals consuming the additive;

        (3) selenium at such levels is not safe to individuals consuming edible portions of animals that receive the additive;

        (4) selenium at such levels does not achieve its intended effect of promoting normal growth and reproduction of livestock and poultry; and
