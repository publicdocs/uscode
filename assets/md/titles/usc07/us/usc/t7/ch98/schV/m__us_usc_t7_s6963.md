## § 6963. Reorganization of Forest Service

    (a) __Required elements of reorganization proposals__ 

    Reorganization proposals that are developed by the Secretary to carry out the designation by the President of the Forest Service as a Reinvention Lab pursuant to the National Performance Review, dated September 1993, shall include proposals for—

        (1) reorganizing the Service in a manner that is consistent with the principles of interdisciplinary planning;

        (2) redefining and consolidating the mission and roles of, and research conducted by, employees of the Service in connection with the National Forest System and State and private forestry to facilitate interdisciplinary planning and to eliminate functionalism;

        (3) reforming the budget structure of the Service to support interdisciplinary planning, including reducing the number of budget line items;

        (4) defining new measures of accountability so that Congress may meet the constitutional obligation of Congress to oversee the Service;

        (5) achieving structural and organizational consolidations;

        (6) to the extent practicable, sharing office space, equipment, vehicles, and electronic systems with other administrative units of the Department and other Federal field offices, including proposals for using an on-line system by all administrative units of the Department to maximize administrative efficiency; and

        (7) reorganizing the Service in a manner that will result in a larger percentage of employees of the Service being retained at organizational levels below regional offices, research stations, and the area office of the Service.

    (b) __Report__ 

        Not later than March 31, 1995, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate that describes actions taken to carry out subsection (a), identifies any disparities in regional funding patterns, and contains the rationale behind the disparities.
