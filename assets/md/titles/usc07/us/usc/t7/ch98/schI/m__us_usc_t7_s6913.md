## § 6913. Reductions in number of Department personnel

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section:

        (1) __Headquarters offices__ 

        The term “headquarters offices”, with respect to agencies, offices, or other administrative units of the Department, means the offices, functions, and employee positions that are located or performed—

            (A) in Washington, District of Columbia; or

            (B) in such other locations as are identified by the Secretary for purposes of this section.

        (2) __Field structure__ 

            The term “field structure” means the offices, functions, and employee positions of all agencies, offices, or other administrative units of the Department, other than the headquarters offices, except that the term does not include State, county, or area committees established under [section 590h(b)(5) of title 16][/us/usc/t16/s590h/b/5]. The term includes the physical and geographic locations of such agencies, offices, or other administrative units.

    (b) __Number of reductions required__ 

        The Secretary shall achieve Federal employee reductions of at least 7,500 staff years within the Department by the end of fiscal year 1999. Reductions in the number of full-time equivalent positions within the Department achieved under section 5 of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 ([Public Law 103–226][/us/pl/103/226]; [108 Stat. 115][/us/stat/108/115]; [5 U.S.C. 3101][/us/usc/t5/s3101] note) shall be counted toward the employee reductions required under this section.

    (c) __Emphasis on headquarters offices reductions__ 

        In achieving the employee reductions required by subsection (b), the Secretary shall pursue a goal so that the percentage of the total number of employee staff years reduced in headquarters offices is at least twice the percentage of the total number of employee staff years reduced in the field structure.

    (d) __Schedule__ 

        The personnel reductions in headquarters offices and in the field structure should be accomplished concurrently in a manner determined by the Secretary.
