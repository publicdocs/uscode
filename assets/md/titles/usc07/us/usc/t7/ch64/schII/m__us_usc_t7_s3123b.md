([Pub. L. 95–113, title XIV, § 1408B][/us/pl/95/113/s1408B], as added [Pub. L. 110–234, title VII, § 7104][/us/pl/110/234/s7104], May 22, 2008, [122 Stat. 1216][/us/stat/122/1216], and [Pub. L. 110–246, § 4(a)][/us/pl/110/246/s4/a], title VII, § 7104, June 18, 2008, [122 Stat. 1664][/us/stat/122/1664], 1977.)

 __References in Text__ 

    The date of enactment of this section, referred to in subsec. (a), is the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246], which was approved June 18, 2008.

    [Section 8605 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s8605], referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original “section 9008(d) of the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 ([7 U.S.C. 8605][/us/usc/t7/s8605])”, and was translated as meaning [section 306 of title III of Pub. L. 106–224][/us/pl/106/224/s306], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because title III of [Pub. L. 106–224][/us/pl/106/224], known as the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, does not contain a section 9008 and section 306 of the Act related to the establishment of the Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee, prior to repeal by [Pub. L. 110–246, title IX, § 9001(b)][/us/pl/110/246/s9001/b], June 18, 2008, [122 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/122/2095].

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234] and [Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246] enacted identical sections. [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234] was repealed by [section 4(a) of Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246/s4/a].

 __Effective Date__ 

    Enactment of this section and repeal of [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234] by [Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246] effective May 22, 2008, the date of enactment of [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234], see [section 4 of Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246/s4], set out as a note under [section 8701 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s8701].
