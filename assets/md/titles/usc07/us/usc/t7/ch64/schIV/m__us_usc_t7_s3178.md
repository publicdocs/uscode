## § 3178. Nutritional status monitoring

    (a) __Formulation of system__ 

    The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall formulate and submit to Congress, within ninety days after September 29, 1977, a proposal for a comprehensive nutritional status monitoring system, to include:

        (1) an assessment system consisting of periodic surveys and continuous monitoring to determine: the extent of risk of nutrition-related health problems in the United States; which population groups or areas of the country face greatest risk; and the likely causes of risk and changes in the above risk factors over time;

        (2) a surveillance system to identify remediable nutrition-related health risks to individuals or for local areas, in such a manner as to tie detection to direct intervention and treatment. Such system should draw on screening and other information from other health programs, including those funded under titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t42/s701] et seq., 1395 et seq., and 1396 et seq.\] and section 330 of the Public Health Service Act;  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and

        (3) program evaluations to determine the adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, and side effects of nutrition-related programs in reducing health risks to individuals and populations.

    (b) __Coordination of existing activities; recommendation for necessary additional authorities__ 

        The proposal shall provide for coordination of activities under existing authorities and contain recommendations for any additional authorities necessary to achieve a comprehensive monitoring system.
