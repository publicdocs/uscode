        (5) __Special rules for apportionment of certain funds__ 

        With respect to funds reserved under paragraph (2) and apportioned under paragraph (3)(A) to carry out the capacity and infrastructure program under subsection (a), the following shall apply:

            (A) When the amount available under this section for allotment to any State on the basis of domestic livestock, poultry, and commercial aquaculture species values and incomes exceeds the amount for which the eligible institution or institutions in the State are eligible on the basis of animal health research capacity, the excess may be used, at the discretion of the Secretary, for remodeling of facilities, construction of new facilities, or increase in staffing, proportionate to the need for added research capacity.

            (B) Whenever a new college of veterinary medicine is established in a State and is accredited, the Secretary, after consultation with the dean of such college and the director of the State agricultural experiment station and where applicable, deans of other accredited colleges in the State, shall provide for the reallocation of funds available to the State pursuant to paragraph (4) between the new college and other eligible institutions in the State, based on the animal health research capacity of each eligible institution.
