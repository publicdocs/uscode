        Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the State shall provide equal matching funds from non-Federal sources.

    (d) __Waiver authority__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (f), the Secretary may waive the matching funds requirement under subsection (c) above the 50 percent level for any fiscal year for an eligible institution of a State if the Secretary determines that the State will be unlikely to satisfy the matching requirement.
