    The Secretary may enter into a contract under subsection (b) if—

        (1) such property is wetland, upland, or highly erodible land;

        (2) such property is determined by the Secretary to be suitable for the purposes involved; and

        (3)

            (A) such property secures any loan made under any law administered by the Secretary and held by the Secretary; and

            (B) such contract better enables a qualified borrower to repay the loan in a timely manner, as determined by the Secretary.

            (A) in the case of a borrower to whom the Secretary has made one or more outstanding loans under laws administered by the Secretary, by canceling that part of the aggregate amount of such outstanding loans that bears the same ratio to such aggregate amount as the number of acres of the real property of the borrower that are subject to the contract bears to the aggregate number of acres securing such loans; or

            (B) in any other case, by treating as prepaid that part of the principal amount of a new loan to the borrower issued and held by the Secretary under a law administered by the Secretary that bears the same ratio to such principal amount as the number of acres of the real property of the borrower that are subject to the contract bears to the aggregate number of acres securing the new loan.
