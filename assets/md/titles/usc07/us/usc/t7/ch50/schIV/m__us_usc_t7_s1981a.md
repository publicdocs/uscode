## § 1981a. Loan moratorium and policy on foreclosures

    (a) __In general__ 

        In addition to any other authority that the Secretary may have to defer principal and interest and forego foreclosure, the Secretary may permit, at the request of the borrower, the deferral of principal and interest on any outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under this chapter, or under the provisions of any other law administered by the Farmers Home Administration or by the Rural Development Administration, and may forego foreclosure of any such loan, for such period as the Secretary deems necessary upon a showing by the borrower that due to circumstances beyond the borrower’s control, the borrower is temporarily unable to continue making payments of such principal and interest when due without unduly impairing the standard of living of the borrower. The Secretary may permit interest that accrues during the deferral period on any loan deferred under this section to bear no interest during or after such period: Provided, That if the security instrument securing such loan is foreclosed such interest as is included in the purchase price at such foreclosure shall become part of the principal and draw interest from the date of foreclosure at the rate prescribed by law.

    (b) __Moratorium__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, effective beginning on the date of the enactment of this subsection, there shall be in effect a moratorium, with respect to farmer program loans made under subchapter I, II, or III, on all acceleration and foreclosure proceedings instituted by the Department of Agriculture against any farmer or rancher who—

            (A) has pending against the Department a claim of program discrimination that is accepted by the Department as valid; or

            (B) files a claim of program discrimination that is accepted by the Department as valid.

        (2) __Waiver of interest and offsets__ 

            During the period of the moratorium, the Secretary shall waive the accrual of interest and offsets on all farmer program loans made under subchapter I, II, or III for which loan acceleration or foreclosure proceedings have been suspended under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Termination of moratorium__ 

        The moratorium shall terminate with respect to a claim of discrimination by a farmer or rancher on the earlier of—

            (A) the date the Secretary resolves the claim; or

            (B) if the farmer or rancher appeals the decision of the Secretary on the claim to a court of competent jurisdiction, the date that the court renders a final decision on the claim.

        (4) __Failure to prevail__ 

            If a farmer or rancher does not prevail on a claim of discrimination described in paragraph (1), the farmer or rancher shall be liable for any interest and offsets that accrued during the period that loan acceleration or foreclosure proceedings have been suspended under paragraph (1).
