    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, prescribe the terms and conditions for making or insuring loans, security instruments and agreements, except as otherwise specified herein, and make such delegations of authority as he deems necessary to carry out this chapter.

    (b) __Debt service margin requirements__ 

    Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in providing farmer program loan guarantees under this chapter, the Secretary shall consider the income of the borrower adequate if the income is equal to or greater than the income necessary—

        (1) to make principal and interest payments on all debt obligations of the borrower, in a timely manner;

        (2) to cover the necessary living expenses of the family of the borrower; and

        (3) to pay all other obligations and expenses of the borrower not financed through debt obligations referred to in paragraph (1).

    (c) __Certified Lenders Program__ 

        (1) __In general__

        (2) __Certification requirements__ 

            The Secretary shall certify a lending institution that meets such criteria as the Secretary may prescribe in regulations, including the ability of the institution to properly make, service, and liquidate the loans of the institution.

        (3) __Condition of certification__ 

            As a condition of the certification, the Secretary shall require the institution to undertake to service the loans guaranteed by the Secretary under this subsection, using standards that are not less stringent than generally accepted banking standards concerning loan servicing employed by prudent commercial or cooperative lenders. The Secretary shall, at least annually, monitor the performance of each certified lender to ensure that the conditions of the certification are being met.

        (4) __Effect of certification__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law:

            (A) The Secretary shall guarantee 80 percent of a loan made under this subsection by a certified lending institution as described in paragraph (1), subject to county committee certification that the borrower of the loan meets the eligibility requirements and such other criteria as may be applicable to loans guaranteed by the Secretary under other provisions of this chapter.

            (B)

             With respect to loans to be guaranteed by the Secretary under this subsection, the Secretary shall permit certified lending institutions to make appropriate certifications (as provided by regulations issued by the Secretary)—

                (i) relating to issues such as creditworthiness, repayment ability, adequacy of collateral, and feasibility of farm operation; and

                (ii) that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of law, including regulations issued by the Secretary.

            (C) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a guarantee not later than 14 calendar days after the date that the lending institution applied to the Secretary for the guarantee. If the Secretary rejects the loan application within the 14-day period, the Secretary shall state, in writing, all of the reasons the application was rejected.

        (5) __Relationship to other requirements__ 

            Neither this subsection nor subsection (d) of this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary to certify eligibility, review financial information, and otherwise assess an application.

    (d) __Preferred Certified Lenders Program__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Commencing not later than two years after October 28, 1992, the Secretary shall establish a Preferred Certified Lenders Program for lenders who establish their—

            (A) knowledge of, and experience under, the program established under subsection (c) of this section;

            (B) knowledge of the regulations concerning the guaranteed loan program; and

            (C) proficiency related to the certified lender program requirements.

            The Secretary shall certify any lending institution as a Preferred Certified Lender that meets such criteria as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.

        (2) __Revocation of designation__ 

            The designation of a lender as a Preferred Certified Lender shall be revoked at any time that the Secretary determines that such lender is not adhering to the rules and regulations applicable to the program or if the loss experiences of a Preferred Certified Lender are excessive as compared to other Preferred Certified Lenders, except that such suspension or revocation shall not affect any outstanding guarantee.

        (3) __Condition of certification__ 

            As a condition of such preferred certification, the Secretary shall require the institution to undertake to service the loans guaranteed by the Secretary under this subsection using generally accepted banking standards concerning loan servicing employed by prudent commercial or cooperative lenders. The Secretary shall, at least annually, monitor the performance of each preferred certified lender to ensure that the conditions of such certification are being met.

            (C) be deemed to have guaranteed 80 percent of a loan made by a preferred certified lending institution as described in paragraph (1), if the Secretary fails to approve or reject the application of such institution within 14 calendar days after the date that the lending institution presented the application to the Secretary. If the Secretary rejects the application within the 14-day period, the Secretary shall state, in writing, the reasons the application was rejected.
