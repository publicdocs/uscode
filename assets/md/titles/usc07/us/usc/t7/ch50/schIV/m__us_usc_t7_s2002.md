([Pub. L. 87–128, title III][/us/pl/87/128/tIII], § 354, as added [Pub. L. 100–233, title VI][/us/pl/100/233/tVI], § 616, Jan. 6, 1988, [101 Stat. 1682][/us/stat/101/1682]; amended [Pub. L. 104–127, title VI][/us/pl/104/127/tVI], § 646, Apr. 4, 1996, [110 Stat. 1103][/us/stat/110/1103].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This Act, referred to in subsec. (a), refers to the Agricultural Act of 1961, [Pub. L. 87–128][/us/pl/87/128], Aug. 8, 1961, [75 Stat. 294][/us/stat/75/294], as amended. For classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1911 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1911] and Tables. However, the reference was probably intended to be “this title” meaning the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, title III of [Pub. L. 87–128][/us/pl/87/128], as amended, which is classified principally to this chapter. For classification of this title to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1921 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1921] and Tables.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–127][/us/pl/104/127] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, substituted “Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary” for “The Secretary, without reimbursement,” in introductory provisions, added par. (2) and struck out former par. (2) which read as follows: “that is determined by the Secretary to be suitable or surplus; and”, and added subsec. (b).
