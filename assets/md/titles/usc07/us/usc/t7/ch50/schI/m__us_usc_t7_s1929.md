## § 1929. Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund

    (a) __Revolving fund__ 

        The fund established pursuant to section 11(a) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, as amended, shall hereafter be called the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund and is hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “fund”. The fund shall remain available as a revolving fund for the discharge of the obligations of the Secretary under agreements insuring loans under this subchapter and loans and mortgages insured under prior authority.

    (b) __Deposits of funds; investments; purchase of notes__ 

        Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. The Secretary may purchase with money in the fund any notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining money for the fund.

    (c) __Notes; form and denominations; maturities; terms and conditions; interest rate; purchase by Treasury; public debt transaction__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this subchapter. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.

    (d) __Notes and security as part of fund; collection or sale of notes; deposit of net proceeds in fund__ 

        Notes and security acquired by the Secretary in connection with loans insured under this subchapter and under prior authority shall become a part of the fund. Notes may be held in the fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold by the Secretary with or without agreements for insurance thereof at the balance due thereon, or on such other basis as the Secretary may determine from time to time. All net proceeds from such collections, including sales of notes or property, shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund.

    (e) __Deposit in fund of portion of charge on outstanding principal obligations; availability of remainder of charge, and merger with appropriations, for administrative expenses__ 

        The Secretary shall deposit in the fund all or a portion, not to exceed one-half of 1 per centum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan, of any charge collected in connection with the insurance of loans; and any remainder of any such charge shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration, in proportion to such charges collected in connection with the insurance of loans by such agency, to be transferred annually and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses for such agency.

    (f) __Utilization of fund__ 

    The Secretary may utilize the fund—

        (1) to pay amounts to which the holder of the note is entitled on loans heretofore or hereafter insured accruing between the date of any payments made by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the lender. In the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;

        (2) to pay to the holder of the notes any deferred or defaulted installment or, upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary’s request, the entire balance due on the loan;

        (3) to purchase notes in accordance with agreements previously entered into;

        (4) to pay for contract services, taxes, insurance, prior liens, expenses necessary to make fiscal adjustments in connection with the application and transmittal of collections and other expenses and advances authorized in connection with insured loans, including the difference between interest payable by borrowers and interest to which insured lenders or insured holders are entitled under agreements with the Secretary included in contracts of insurance;

        (5) to pay the Secretary’s costs of administration necessary to insure, make grants, service, and otherwise carry out the programs under this chapter not specifically covered by the Rural Development Insurance Fund of [section 1929a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1929a], including costs of the Secretary incidental to guaranteeing loans under this chapter, either directly from the Fund or by transfers from the Fund to, and merger with, any appropriations for administrative expenses.

    (g) __Transfer of funds from Farmers Home Administration direct loan account and Emergency Credit Revolving Fund; abolition of such account and fund; payments from Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; interest__ 

        (1) The assets and liabilities of, and authorizations applicable to, the Farmers Home Administration direct loan account created by [section 1988(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1988/c] (before the amendment made by section 749(a)(1) of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996) and the Emergency Credit Revolving Fund referred to in [section 1966 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1966] are hereby transferred to the fund, and such account and such revolving fund are hereby abolished. Such assets and their proceeds, including loans made out of the fund pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, the last sentence of section 1926(a)(1), and the last sentence of [section 1927 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1927].

        (2) From time to time, and at least at the close of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay from the fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts interest on the value as determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Comptroller General, of the Government’s equity transferred to the fund pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection plus the cumulative amount of appropriations made available after enactment of this provision as capital and for administration of the programs financed from the fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the fund during the year. The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of loans made or insured from the fund, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest. If at any time the Secretary determines that moneys in the fund exceed present and any reasonably prospective future requirements of the fund, such excess may be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.

    (h) __Guaranteed loans; interest rate for loans sold into secondary market; loan fees__ 

        (1) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to borrowers for purposes provided in this chapter by guaranteeing loans made by any Federal or State chartered bank, savings and loan association, cooperative lending agency, or other legally organized lending agency.

        (2) The interest rate payable by a borrower on the portion of a guaranteed loan that is sold by a lender to the secondary market under this chapter may be lower than the interest rate charged on the portion retained by the lender, but shall not exceed the average interest rate charged by the lender on loans made to farm and ranch borrowers.

        (3)

            (B) a lender may charge a loan origination and servicing fee in an amount not to exceed 1 percent of the amount of the loan.

        Except as provided in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7), a loan guarantee under this chapter shall be for not more than 90 percent of the principal and interest due on the loan.

        (5)  __Refinanced loans guaranteed at 95 percent__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall guarantee 95 percent of—

            (A) in the case of a loan that solely refinances a direct loan made under this chapter, the principal and interest due on the loan on the date of the refinancing; or

            (B) in the case of a loan that is used for multiple purposes, the portion of the loan that refinances the principal and interest due on a direct loan made under this chapter that is outstanding on the date the loan is guaranteed.

        (6)  __Beginning farmer loans guaranteed up to 95 percent__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary may guarantee not more than 95 percent of—

            (A) a farm ownership loan for acquiring a farm or ranch to a borrower who is participating in the down payment loan program under [section 1935 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1935]; or

            (B) an operating loan to a borrower who is participating in the down payment loan program under [section 1935 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1935] that is made during the period that the borrower has a direct loan outstanding under this subchapter for acquiring a farm or ranch.

        (7)  __Amount of guarantee of loans for farm operations on tribal lands__  __.—__ 

        In the case of an operating loan made to a farmer or rancher whose farm or ranch land is subject to the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe and whose loan is secured by 1 or more security instruments that are subject to the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, the Secretary shall guarantee 95 percent of the loan.

    (i) __Coordination of assistance for qualified beginning farmers and ranchers__ 

        (1) Not later than 60 days after any State expresses to the Secretary, in writing, a desire to coordinate the provision of financial assistance to qualified beginning farmers and ranchers in the State, the Secretary and the State shall conclude a joint memorandum of understanding that shall govern the coordination of the provision of the financial assistance by the State and the Secretary.

        (2) The memorandum of understanding shall provide that if a State beginning farmer program makes a commitment to provide a qualified beginning farmer or rancher with financing to establish or maintain a viable farming or ranching operation, the Secretary shall, subject to applicable law, normal loan approval criteria, and the availability of funds provide the farmer or rancher with a down payment loan under [section 1935 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1935] or a guarantee of the financing provided by the State program, or both.

        (3) The Secretary shall not charge any person (including a lender) any fee with respect to the provision of any guarantee under this subsection.

        (4) The Secretary shall notify each State of the provisions of this subsection.

        (5)
