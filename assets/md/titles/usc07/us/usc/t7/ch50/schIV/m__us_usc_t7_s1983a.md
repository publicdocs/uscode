        (3) In accordance with [section 2006d of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2006d], the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus on each seasoned direct loan borrower determined eligible to obtain a guaranteed loan.

        (5) If the Secretary is unable to provide loan guarantees and, if necessary, interest assistance to the seasoned direct loan borrower under this subsection in amounts sufficient to enable the seasoned direct loan borrower to borrow from commercial sources the amount required to carry out a financially viable farming plan, or if the Secretary does not receive an offer from an approved lender to extend credit to a seasoned direct loan borrower under the terms and conditions contained in the prospectus, the Secretary shall make an insured loan to the seasoned direct loan borrower under subchapter I or II of this chapter, whichever is applicable.

        (6) To the extent necessary for the borrower to obtain a loan, guaranteed by the Secretary, from a commercial or cooperative lender, the Secretary shall provide interest rate reductions as provided for under [section 1999 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1999].

 __References in Text__ 

    For definition of “this chapter”, referred to in subsecs. (a), (b)(1), (c), (f)(1)(B), and (g)(1), see note set out under [section 1921 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1921].

    [Section 1989 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1989], referred to in subsec. (f)(1)(A), was in the original “section 114”, and was translated as meaning [section 339 of Pub. L. 87–128][/us/pl/87/128/s339], which is classified to [section 1989 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1989], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 87–128][/us/pl/87/128] does not contain a section 114 and section 1989 provides for a lender certification program.
