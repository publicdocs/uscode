    (c) __Limitation__ 

        The Secretary may not make a guarantee or commitment to guarantee with respect to a note or other obligation if the total amount of outstanding notes or obligations guaranteed under this section (excluding any amount repaid under the contract entered into under subsection (e)(1)(A) of this section) for issuers in the State would exceed an amount equal to 5 times the sum of the total amount of grants made to the State under [section 2009f of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2009f].

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, a State to which a grant is made under [section 2009f of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2009f] may use the grant (including program income derived from the grant) to pay principal and interest due (including such servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be specified in regulations of the Secretary) on any note or other obligation guaranteed under this section.

    (e) __Repayment contract; security__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        To ensure the repayment of notes or other obligations and charges incurred under this section and as a condition for receiving the guarantees, the Secretary shall require the issuer to—

            (B) pledge any grant for which the issuer may become eligible under this subchapter; and

            (C) furnish, at the discretion of the Secretary, such other security as may be considered appropriate by the Secretary in making the guarantees.
