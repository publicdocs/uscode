## § 2005. Payment of losses on guaranteed loans

    (a) __Payments to lenders__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            Within 3 months after a court of competent jurisdiction confirms a plan of reorganization under chapter 12 of title 11, for any borrower to whom a lender has made a loan guaranteed under this chapter, the Secretary shall pay the lender an amount estimated by the Secretary to be equal to the loss incurred by the lender for purposes of the guarantee.

        (2) __Payment toward loan guarantee__ 

            Any amount paid to a lender under this subsection with respect to a loan guaranteed under this chapter shall be treated as payment towards satisfaction of the loan guarantee.

    (b) __Administration__ 

        (1) __Loss by lender__ 

        If the lender of a guaranteed farmer program loan takes any action described in [section 1981(b)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1981/b/4] with respect to the loan and the Secretary approves such action, then, for purposes of the guarantee, the lender shall be treated as having sustained a loss equal to the amount by which—

            (A) the outstanding balance of the loan immediately before such action, exceeds

            (B) the outstanding balance of the loan immediately after such action.

        (2) __Net present value of loan__ 

        The Secretary shall approve the taking of an action described in [section 1981(b)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1981/b/4] by the lender of a guaranteed farmer program loan with respect to the loan if such action reduces the net present value of the loan to an amount equal to not less than the greater of—

            (A) the greatest net present value of a loan the borrower could reasonably be expected to repay; and

            (B) the greatest amount that the lender of the loan could reasonably expect to recover from the borrower through bankruptcy, or liquidation of the property securing the loan, less all reasonable and necessary costs and expenses that the lender of the loan could reasonably expect to incur to preserve or dispose of such property (including all associated legal and property management costs) in the course of such a bankruptcy or liquidation.

        (3) __Construction of subsection__ 

            This subsection shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to enter into a shared appreciation arrangement with a borrower, or the terms and conditions which shall be required of a borrower, under [section 2001(e) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2001/e].
