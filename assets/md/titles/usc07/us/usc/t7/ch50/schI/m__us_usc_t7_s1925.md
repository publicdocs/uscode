        In determining the value of the farm, the Secretary shall consider appraisals made by competent appraisers under rules established by the Secretary.

    (c) __Inflation percentage__ 

    For purposes of this section, the inflation percentage applicable to a fiscal year is the percentage (if any) by which—

        (1) the average of the Prices Paid By Farmers Index (as compiled by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the Department of Agriculture) for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year; exceeds

        (2) the average of such index (as so defined) for the 12-month period ending on August 31, 1996.
