        (1) __In general__ 

            Following the issuance of an order under [section 7103 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7103], the Secretary shall conduct a referendum among producers, feeders, and importers who, during a representative period as determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production, feeding, or importation of sheep or sheep products for the purpose of ascertaining whether the order shall go into effect.

        (2) __Approval of order__ 

            The order shall become effective only if the Secretary determines that the order has been approved by not less than a majority of the producers, feeders, and importers voting in the referendum or at least ⅔ of the production represented by persons voting in the referendum.

    (b) __Additional referenda__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            After the initial referendum, on the request of a representative group comprising 10 percent or more of the producers, feeders, and importers who, during a representative period as determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production, feeding, importation, or processing of sheep or sheep products, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers, feeders, and importers to determine whether the producers, feeders, and importers favor the termination or suspension of the order.

        (2) __Suspension or termination__ 

        If the Secretary determines that suspension or termination of the order is favored by a majority of the producers, feeders, and importers voting in the referendum or at least ⅔ of the production represented by the persons voting in the referendum, the Secretary shall suspend or terminate—

            (A) collection of assessments under the order not later than 180 days after the determination; and

        (2) __Date__ 

            Each referendum under this section shall be conducted on a date established by the Secretary, under a procedure by which producers, feeders, and importers intending to vote in the referendum shall certify that the producers, feeders, and importers were engaged in the production, feeding, or importation of sheep or sheep products during the representative period and, on the same day, shall be provided an opportunity to vote in the referendum.
