## § 5202. Policy

    It is the policy of the United States—

    (1) to provide, through all possible means, agricultural commodities and products for export at competitive prices, with full assurance of quality and reliability of supply;

    (2) to support the principle of free trade and the promotion of fair trade in agricultural commodities and products;

    (3) to support fully the negotiating objectives set forth in [section 2901(b) of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s2901/b] to eliminate or reduce substantially constraints on fair and open trade in agricultural commodities and products;

    (4) to use statutory authority to counter unfair foreign trade practices and to use all available means, including export promotion programs, and, if necessary, restrictions on United States imports of agricultural commodities and products, in order to encourage fair and open trade; and

    (5) to provide for increased representation of United States agricultural trade interests in the formulation of national fiscal and monetary policy affecting trade.
