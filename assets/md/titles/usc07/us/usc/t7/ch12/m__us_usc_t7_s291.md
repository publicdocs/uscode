Such associations may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members may make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes: Provided, however, That such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of the members thereof, as such producers, and conform to one or both of the following requirements:

    Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum.

    And in any case to the following:
