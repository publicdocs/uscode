## § 8103. Biorefinery, renewable chemical, and biobased product manufacturing assistance

    (a) __Purpose__ 

    The purpose of this section is to assist in the development of new and emerging technologies for the development of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and biobased product manufacturing so as to—

        (1) increase the energy independence of the United States;

        (2) promote resource conservation, public health, and the environment;

        (3) diversify markets for agricultural and forestry products and agriculture waste material; and

        (4) create jobs and enhance the economic development of the rural economy.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Biobased product manufacturing__ 

            The term “biobased product manufacturing” means development, construction, and retrofitting of technologically new commercial-scale processing and manufacturing equipment and required facilities that will be used to convert renewable chemicals and other biobased outputs of biorefineries into end-user products on a commercial scale.

        (2) __Eligible entity__ 

            The term “eligible entity” means an individual, entity, Indian tribe, or unit of State or local government, including a corporation, farm cooperative, farmer cooperative organization, association of agricultural producers, National Laboratory, institution of higher education, rural electric cooperative, public power entity, or consortium of any of those entities.

        (3) __Eligible technology__ 

        The term “eligible technology” means, as determined by the Secretary—

            (A) a technology that is being adopted in a viable commercial-scale operation of a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel; and

            (B) a technology not described in subparagraph (A) that has been demonstrated to have technical and economic potential for commercial application in a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel.

    (c) __Assistance__ 

        The Secretary shall make available to eligible entities guarantees for loans made to fund the development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale biorefineries using eligible technology.

    (d) __Loan guarantees__ 

        (1) __Selection criteria__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In approving loan guarantee applications, the Secretary shall establish a priority scoring system that assigns priority scores to each application and only approve applications that exceed a specified minimum, as determined by the Secretary.

            (B) __Feasibility__ 

                In approving a loan guarantee application, the Secretary shall determine the technical and economic feasibility of the project based on a feasibility study of the project described in the application conducted by an independent third party.

            (C) __Scoring system__ 

            In determining the priority scoring system for loan guarantees under subsection (c), the Secretary shall consider—

                (i) whether the applicant has established a market for the advanced biofuel and the byproducts produced;

                (iii) whether the applicant is proposing to use a feedstock not previously used in the production of advanced biofuels;

                (iv) whether the applicant is proposing to work with producer associations or cooperatives;

                (v) the level of financial participation by the applicant, including support from non-Federal and private sources;

                (vi) whether the applicant has established that the adoption of the process proposed in the application will have a positive impact on resource conservation, public health, and the environment;

                (vii) whether the applicant can establish that if adopted, the biofuels production technology proposed in the application will not have any significant negative impacts on existing manufacturing plants or other facilities that use similar feedstocks;

                (viii) the potential for rural economic development;

                (ix) the level of local ownership proposed in the application; and

                (x) whether the project can be replicated.

            (D) __Project diversity__ 

                In approving loan guarantee applications, the Secretary shall ensure that, to the extent practicable, there is diversity in the types of projects approved for loan guarantees to ensure that as wide a range as possible of technologies, products, and approaches are assisted.

        (2) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Maximum amount of loan guaranteed__ 

                The principal amount of a loan guaranteed under subsection (c) may not exceed $250,000,000.

                    Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be in an amount not to exceed 80 percent of the project costs, as determined by the Secretary.

                (ii) __Other direct Federal funding__ 

                    The amount of a loan guaranteed for a project under subsection (c) shall be reduced by the amount of other direct Federal funding that the eligible entity receives for the same project.

                    The Secretary may guarantee up to 90 percent of the principal and interest due on a loan guaranteed under subsection (c).

            (C) __Loan guarantee fund distribution__

        In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy.

    (f) __Condition on provision of assistance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            As a condition of receiving a grant or loan guarantee under this section, an eligible entity shall ensure that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of construction work financed, in whole or in part, with the grant or loan guarantee, as the case may be, shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141 through 3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40.
