## § 8103. Biorefinery assistance

    (a) __Purpose__ 

    The purpose of this section is to assist in the development of new and emerging technologies for the development of advanced biofuels, so as to—

        (1) increase the energy independence of the United States;

        (2) promote resource conservation, public health, and the environment;

        (3) diversify markets for agricultural and forestry products and agriculture waste material; and

        (4) create jobs and enhance the economic development of the rural economy.

            (A) a technology that is being adopted in a viable commercial-scale operation of a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel; and

            (B) a technology not described in subparagraph (A) that has been demonstrated to have technical and economic potential for commercial application in a biorefinery that produces an advanced biofuel.

    (c) __Assistance__

                (vi) the potential for rural economic development;

                (vii) whether the area in which the applicant proposes to locate the biorefinery has other similar facilities;

                (viii) whether the project can be replicated; and
