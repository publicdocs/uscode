    (a) __Income and other financial resources as substantial limiting factors in obtaining more nutritious diet; recipients under Social Security Act__ 

        Participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program shall be limited to those households whose incomes and other financial resources, held singly or in joint ownership, are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them to obtain a more nutritious diet.

Except for sections 2015, 2025(e)(1), and section 2012(n)(4)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of this title, households in which each member receives benefits under a State or local general assistance program that complies with standards established by the Secretary for ensuring that the program is based on income criteria comparable to or more restrictive than those under subsection (c)(2), and not limited to one-time emergency payments that cannot be provided for more than one consecutive month, shall be eligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program. Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation.

    (b) __Eligibility standards__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Secretary shall establish uniform national standards of eligibility (other than the income standards for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States established in accordance with subsections (c) and (e) of this section) for participation by households in the supplemental nutrition assistance program in accordance with the provisions of this section. No plan of operation submitted by a State agency shall be approved unless the standards of eligibility meet those established by the Secretary, and no State agency shall impose any other standards of eligibility as a condition for participating in the program.

    (c) __Gross income standard__ 

    The income standards of eligibility shall be adjusted each October 1 and shall provide that a household shall be ineligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program if—

        (14) any payment made to the household under [section 2015(d)(4)(I) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d/4/I] or a pilot project under [section 2025(h)(1)(F) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2025/h/1/F] for work related expenses or for dependent care;

            (C) __Standard utility allowance__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In computing the excess shelter expense deduction, a State agency may use a standard utility allowance in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, subject to clause (iv), except that a State agency may use an allowance that does not fluctuate within a year to reflect seasonal variations.

                (ii) __Restrictions on heating and cooling expenses__ 

                An allowance for a heating or cooling expense may not be used in the case of a household that—

                    (I) does not incur a heating or cooling expense, as the case may be;

                    (II) does incur a heating or cooling expense but is located in a public housing unit that has central utility meters and charges households, with regard to the expense, only for excess utility costs; or

                    (III) shares the expense with, and lives with, another individual not participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, another household participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or both, unless the allowance is prorated between the household and the other individual, household, or both.

                (iii) __Mandatory allowance__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                    A State agency may make the use of a standard utility allowance mandatory for all households with qualifying utility costs if—

                        (aa) the State agency has developed 1 or more standards that include the cost of heating and cooling and 1 or more standards that do not include the cost of heating and cooling; and

                        (bb) the Secretary finds (without regard to subclause (III)) that the standards will not result in an increased cost to the Secretary.

                    (II) __Household election__ 

                        A State agency that has not made the use of a standard utility allowance mandatory under subclause (I) shall allow a household to switch, at the end of a certification period, between the standard utility allowance and a deduction based on the actual utility costs of the household.

                    (III) __Inapplicability of certain restrictions__ 

                        Clauses (ii)(II) and (ii)(III) shall not apply in the case of a State agency that has made the use of a standard utility allowance mandatory under subclause (I).

                (iv) __Availability of allowance to recipients of energy assistance__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Subject to subclause (II), if a State agency elects to use a standard utility allowance that reflects heating and cooling costs, the standard utility allowance shall be made available to households that received a payment, or on behalf of which a payment was made, under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 ([42 U.S.C. 8621][/us/usc/t42/s8621] et seq.) or other similar energy assistance program, if in the current month or in the immediately preceding 12 months, the household either received such a payment, or such a payment was made on behalf of the household, that was greater than $20 annually, as determined by the Secretary.

                    (II) __Separate allowance__ 

                        A State agency may use a separate standard utility allowance for households on behalf of which a payment described in subclause (I) is made, but may not be required to do so.

                    (III) __States not electing to use separate allowance__ 

                        A State agency that does not elect to use a separate allowance but makes a single standard utility allowance available to households incurring heating or cooling expenses (other than a household described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (ii)) may not be required to reduce the allowance due to the provision (directly or indirectly) of assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 ([42 U.S.C. 8621][/us/usc/t42/s8621] et seq.).

                    (IV) __Proration of assistance__

                (i) __Alternative deduction__ 

                    In lieu of the deduction provided under subparagraph (A), a State agency may elect to allow a household in which all members are homeless individuals, but that is not receiving free shelter throughout the month, to receive a deduction of $143 per month.

                (ii) __Ineligibility__ 

                    The State agency may make a household with extremely low shelter costs ineligible for the alternative deduction under clause (i).

    (f) __Calculation of household income; prospective or retrospective accounting basis; consistency__ 

        (1)

            (A) Household income for those households that, by contract for other than an hourly or piecework basis or by self-employment, derive their annual income in a period of time shorter than one year shall be calculated by averaging such income over a twelve-month period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, household income resulting from the self-employment of a member in a farming operation, who derives income from such farming operation and who has irregular expenses to produce such income, may, at the option of the household, be calculated by averaging such income and expenses over a 12-month period. Notwithstanding the first sentence, if the averaged amount does not accurately reflect the household’s actual monthly circumstances because the household has experienced a substantial increase or decrease in business earnings, the State agency shall calculate the self-employment income based on anticipated earnings.

            (B) Household income for those households that receive nonexcluded income of the type described in subsection (d)(3) of this section shall be calculated by averaging such income over the period for which it is received.

            (C) __Simplified determination of deductions.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                Except as provided in clause (ii), for the purposes of subsection (e), a State agency may elect to disregard until the next recertification of eligibility under [section 2020(e)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2020/e/4] 1 or more types of changes in the circumstances of a household that affect the amount of deductions the household may claim under subsection (e).

                (ii)  __Changes that may not be disregarded__  __.—__ 

                Under clause (i), a State agency may not disregard—

                    (I) any reported change of residence; or

                    (II) under standards prescribed by the Secretary, any change in earned income.

        (2)

            (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), households shall have their incomes calculated on a prospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(A), or, at the option of the State agency, on a retrospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(B).

            (B) In the case of the first month, or at the option of the State, the first and second months, during a continuous period in which a household is certified, the State agency shall determine eligibility and the amount of benefits on the basis of the household’s income and other relevant circumstances in such first or second month.

            (C) Households specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of [section 2015(c)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/c/1/A] shall have their income calculated on a prospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(A).

            (D) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), households required to submit monthly reports of their income and household circumstances under [section 2015(c)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/c/1] shall have their income calculated on a retrospective basis, as provided in paragraph (3)(B).

        (3)

            (A) Calculation of household income on a prospective basis is the calculation of income on the basis of the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which shall provide for taking into account both the income reasonably anticipated to be received by the household during the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined and the income received by the household during the preceding thirty days.

            (B) Calculation of household income on a retrospective basis is the calculation of income for the period for which eligibility or benefits are being determined on the basis of income received in a previous period. Such calculation shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which may provide for the determination of eligibility on a prospective basis in some or all cases in which benefits are calculated under this paragraph. Such regulations shall provide for supplementing the initial allotments of newly applying households in those cases in which the determination of income under this paragraph causes serious hardship.

        (4) In promulgating regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to assure that, to the extent feasible and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t42/s301] et seq.\], the income of households receiving benefits under this chapter and title IV–A of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.\] is calculated on a comparable basis under this chapter and the Social Security Act. The Secretary is authorized, upon the request of a State agency, to waive any of the provisions of this subsection (except the provisions of paragraph (2)(A)) to the extent necessary to permit the State agency to calculate income for purposes of this chapter on the same basis that income is calculated under title IV–A of the Social Security Act in that State.

    (g) __Allowable financial resources__ 

        (1) __Total amount.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe the types and allowable amounts of financial resources (liquid and nonliquid assets) an eligible household may own, and shall, in so doing, assure that a household otherwise eligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program will not be eligible to participate if its resources exceed $2,000 (as adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)), or, in the case of a household which consists of or includes an elderly or disabled member, if its resources exceed $3,000 (as adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)).

            (B) __Adjustment for inflation.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                Beginning on October 1, 2008, and each October 1 thereafter, the amounts specified in subparagraph (A) shall be adjusted and rounded down to the nearest $250 increment to reflect changes for the 12-month period ending the preceding June in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

                (ii)  __Requirement__  __.—__ 

                Each adjustment under clause (i) shall be based on the unrounded amount for the prior 12-month period.

        (2) __Included assets.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, in prescribing inclusions in, and exclusions from, financial resources, follow the regulations in force as of June 1, 1982 (other than those relating to licensed vehicles and inaccessible resources).

            (B)  __Additional included assets__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall include in financial resources—

                (i) any boat, snowmobile, or airplane used for recreational purposes;

                (ii) any vacation home;

                (iii) any mobile home used primarily for vacation purposes;

                (iv) subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), any licensed vehicle that is used for household transportation or to obtain or continue employment to the extent that the fair market value of the vehicle exceeds $4,650; and

                (v) any savings account, regardless of whether there is a penalty for early withdrawal.

            (C)  __Excluded vehicles__  __.—__ 

            A vehicle (and any other property, real or personal, to the extent the property is directly related to the maintenance or use of the vehicle) shall not be included in financial resources under this paragraph if the vehicle is—

                (i) used to produce earned income;

                (ii) necessary for the transportation of a physically disabled household member; or

            (D)  __Alternative vehicle allowance__  __.—__ 

            If the vehicle allowance standards that a State agency uses to determine eligibility for assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.) would result in a lower attribution of resources to certain households than under subparagraph (B)(iv), in lieu of applying subparagraph (B)(iv), the State agency may elect to apply the State vehicle allowance standards to all households that would incur a lower attribution of resources under the State vehicle allowance standards.

        (3) The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of a burial plot for each member of a household and nonliquid resources necessary to allow the household to carry out a plan for self-sufficiency approved by the State agency that constitutes adequate participation in an employment and training program under [section 2015(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d] or a pilot project under [section 2025(h)(1)(F) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2025/h/1/F]. The Secretary shall also exclude from financial resources any earned income tax credits received by any member of the household for a period of 12 months from receipt if such member was participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program at the time the credits were received and participated in such program continuously during the 12-month period.

        (4) In the case of farm property (including land, equipment, and supplies) that is essential to the self-employment of a household member in a farming operation, the Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of such property until the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date such member ceases to be self-employed in farming.

        (5) The Secretary shall promulgate rules by which State agencies shall develop standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to be able to sell for any significant return because the household’s interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household’s interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified shall be excluded as inaccessible resources. A resource shall be so identified if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information provided by the household is questionable.

        (6) __Exclusion of types of financial resources not considered under certain other federal programs.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (B), a State agency may, at the option of the State agency, exclude from financial resources under this subsection any types of financial resources that the State agency does not consider when determining eligibility for—

                (i) cash assistance under a program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.); or

                (ii) medical assistance under section 1931 of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1396u–1][/us/usc/t42/s1396u–1]).

            (B)  __Limitations__  __.—__ 

            Except to the extent that any of the types of resources specified in clauses (i) through (iv) are excluded under another paragraph of this subsection, subparagraph (A) does not authorize a State agency to exclude—

                (i) cash;

                (ii) licensed vehicles;

                (iii) amounts in any account in a financial institution that are readily available to the household; or

                (iv) any other similar type of resource the inclusion in financial resources of which the Secretary determines by regulation to be essential to equitable determinations of eligibility under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

        (7) __Exclusion of retirement accounts from allowable financial resources.—__ 

            (A)  __Mandatory exclusions__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of—

                (i) any funds in a plan, contract, or account, described in sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, 457(b), and 501(c)(18) of title 26 and the value of funds in a Federal Thrift Savings Plan account as provided in [section 8439 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8439]; and

            The Secretary may exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of any other education programs, contracts, or accounts (as determined by the Secretary).

    (h) __Temporary emergency standards of eligibility; Disaster Task Force; direct assistance to State and local officials__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall, after consultation with the official empowered to exercise the authority provided for by sections 5170a and 5192 of title 42, establish temporary emergency standards of eligibility for the duration of the emergency for households who are victims of a disaster which disrupts commercial channels of food distribution, if such households are in need of temporary food assistance and if commercial channels of food distribution have again become available to meet the temporary food needs of such households. Such standards as are prescribed for individual emergencies may be promulgated without regard to [section 2013(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2013/c] or the procedures set forth in [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553].

        (2)

         The Secretary shall—

            (A) establish a Disaster Task Force to assist States in implementing and operating the disaster program and the regular supplemental nutrition assistance program in the disaster area; and

        (3)

            (A) The Secretary shall provide, by regulation, for emergency allotments to eligible households to replace food destroyed in a disaster. The regulations shall provide for replacement of the value of food actually lost up to a limit approved by the Secretary not greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the household size.

            (B) The Secretary shall adjust issuance methods and reporting and other application requirements to be consistent with what is practicable under actual conditions in the affected area. In making this adjustment, the Secretary shall consider the availability of the State agency’s offices and personnel, any conditions that make reliance on electronic benefit transfer systems described in [section 2016(h) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2016/h] impracticable, and any damage to or disruption of transportation and communication facilities.

    (i) __Attribution of income and resources to sponsored aliens; coverage, computations, etc.__ 

        (1) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under this chapter for an individual who is an alien as described in [section 2015(f)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/f/2/B], the income and resources of any person who as a sponsor of such individual’s entry into the United States executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor’s spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of such individual for a period of three years after the individual’s entry into the United States. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.

        (2)

            (A)

                (iii) the monthly income attributed to such alien shall be one-twelfth of the amount calculated under clause (ii) of this subparagraph.

                (ii) the amount determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by $1,500; and

            (C)

Such alien shall also be required to provide such information and documentation which such alien or the sponsor provided in support of such alien’s immigration application as the State agency may request.

            (D) Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severably liable for an amount equal to any overpayment made to such alien during the period of three years after such alien’s entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor’s failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause for such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions of [section 2022(b) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2022/b].
