## § 2026. Research, demonstration, and evaluations

    (a) __Contracts or grants; issuance of aggregate allotments__ 

        (1) The Secretary may enter into contracts with or make grants to public or private organizations or agencies under this section to undertake research that will help improve the administration and effectiveness of the supplemental nutrition assistance program in delivering nutrition-related benefits. The waiver authority of the Secretary under subsection (b) shall extend to all contracts and grants under this section.

        (2) The Secretary may, on application, permit not more than two State agencies to establish procedures that allow households whose monthly supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits do not exceed $20, at their option, to receive, in lieu of their supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits for the initial period under [section 2017 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2017] and their regular allotment in following months, and at intervals of up to 3 months thereafter, aggregate allotments not to exceed $60 and covering not more than 3 months’ benefits. The allotments shall be provided in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (9) of [section 2020(e) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2020/e] (except that no household shall begin to receive combined allotments under this section until it has complied with all applicable verification requirements of [section 2020(e)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2020/e/3]) and (with respect to the first aggregate allotment so issued) within 40 days of the last benefit issuance.

    (b) __Pilot projects__ 

        (1)

            (A) The Secretary may conduct on a trial basis, in one or more areas of the United States, pilot or experimental projects designed to test program changes that might increase the efficiency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program and improve the delivery of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits to eligible households, and may waive any requirement of this chapter to the extent necessary for the project to be conducted.

            (B) __Project requirements.—__ 

                (i)  __Program goal__  __.—__ 

                The Secretary may not conduct a project under subparagraph (A) unless—

                If the Secretary finds that a project under subparagraph (A) would reduce benefits by more than 20 percent for more than 5 percent of households in the area subject to the project (not including any household whose benefits are reduced due to a failure to comply with work or other conduct requirements), the project—

                    (I) may not include more than 15 percent of the number of households in the State receiving supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits; and

                    (II) shall continue for not more than 5 years after the date of implementation, unless the Secretary approves an extension requested by the State agency at any time.

                (iv)  __Impermissible projects__  __.—__ 

                The Secretary may not conduct a project under subparagraph (A) that—

                    (I) involves the payment of the value of an allotment in the form of cash or otherwise providing benefits in a form not restricted to the purchase of food, unless the project was approved prior to August 22, 1996;

                    (II) has the effect of substantially transferring funds made available under this chapter to services or benefits provided primarily through another public assistance program, or using the funds for any purpose other than the purchase of food, program administration, or an employment or training program;

                Subject to the availability of appropriations under [section 2027(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2027/a], any pilot or experimental project implemented under this paragraph and operating as of October 1, 1981, involving the payment of the value of allotments in the form of cash to eligible households all of whose members are either age sixty-five or over or entitled to supplemental security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act shall be continued if the State so requests.

            (C)

                (i)

                 No waiver or demonstration program shall be approved under this chapter after November 28, 1990, unless—

                    (I) any household whose food assistance is issued in a form other than EBT cards has its allotment increased to the extent necessary to compensate for any State or local sales tax that may be collected in all or part of the area covered by the demonstration project, the tax on purchases of food by any such household is waived, or the Secretary determines on the basis of information provided by the State agency that the increase is unnecessary on the basis of the limited nature of the items subject to the State or local sales tax; and

                    (II) the State agency conducting the demonstration project pays the cost of any increased allotments.

                (ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if a waiver or demonstration project already provides a household with assistance that exceeds that which the household would otherwise be eligible to receive by more than the estimated amount of any sales tax on the purchases of food that would be collected from the household in the project area in which the household resides.

            (D) __Response to waivers.—__ 

                (i)  __Response__  __.—__

                (iii)  __Notice of denial__  __.—__ 

                On denial of a waiver request under clause (i)(III), the Secretary shall provide a copy of the waiver request and a description of the reasons for the denial to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

        (2) The Secretary shall, jointly with the Secretary of Labor, implement two pilot projects involving the performance of work in return for supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits in each of the seven administrative regions of the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, such projects to be (A) appropriately divided in each region between locations that are urban and rural in characteristics and among locations selected to provide a representative cross-section of political subdivisions in the States and (B) submitted for approval prior to project implementation, together with the names of the agencies or organizations that will be engaged in such projects, to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate. Under such pilot projects, any person who is subject to the work registration requirements pursuant to [section 2015(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d], and is a member of a household that does not have earned income equal to or exceeding the allotment to which the household is otherwise entitled pursuant to [section 2017(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2017/a], shall be ineligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program as a member of any household during any month in which such person refuses, after not being offered employment in the private sector of the economy for more than thirty days (ten days in at least one pilot project area designated by the Secretary) after the initial registration for employment referred to in [section 2015(d)(1)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d/1/A/i], to accept an offer of employment from a political subdivision or provider pursuant to a program carried out under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \[[29 U.S.C. 3111][/us/usc/t29/s3111] et seq.\], for which employment compensation shall be paid in the form of the allotment to which the household is otherwise entitled pursuant to [section 2017(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2017/a], with each hour of employment entitling the household to a portion of the allotment equal in value to 100 per centum of the Federal minimum hourly rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended ([29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)][/us/usc/t29/s206/a/1]); which employment shall not, together with any other hours worked in any other capacity by such person exceed forty hours a week; and which employment shall not be used by the employer to fill a job opening created by the action of such employer in laying off or terminating the employment of any regular employee not supported under this paragraph in anticipation of filling the vacancy so created by hiring an employee or employees to be supported under this paragraph, if all of the jobs supported under the program have been made available to participants in the program before the political subdivision or provider providing the jobs extends an offer of employment under this paragraph, and if the political subdivision or provider, in employing the person, complies with the requirements of Federal law that relate to the program. The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly issue reports to the appropriate committees of Congress on the progress of such pilot projects no later than six and twelve months following September 29, 1977, shall issue interim reports no later than October 1, 1979, October 1, 1980, and March 30, 1981, shall issue a final report describing the results of such pilot projects based upon their operation from their commencement through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, and shall pay to the agencies or organizations operating such pilot projects 50 per centum of all administrative costs involved in such operation.

        (3)

            (A) The Secretary may conduct demonstration projects to test improved consistency or coordination between the supplemental nutrition assistance program employment and training program and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program under title IV of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.).

            (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may, as part of a project authorized under this paragraph, waive requirements under [section 2015(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d] to permit a State to operate an employment and training program for supplemental nutrition assistance program recipients on the same terms and conditions under which the State operates its Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program for recipients of aid to families with dependent children under part F 1 of title IV of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 681][/us/usc/t42/s681] et seq.). Any work experience program conducted as part of the project shall be conducted in conformity with section 482(f) 1 of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 682(f)][/us/usc/t42/s682/f]).

            (C) A State seeking such a waiver shall provide assurances that the resulting employment and training program shall meet the requirements of subsections (a)(19) and (g) of section 402 1 of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 602][/us/usc/t42/s602]) (but not including the provision of transitional benefits under clauses (ii) through (vii) of section 402(g)(1)(A) 1) and sections 481 through 487 1 of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 681][/us/usc/t42/s681] through 687). Each reference to “aid to families with dependent children” in such sections shall be deemed to be a reference to supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits for purposes of the demonstration project.

            (D) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, participation in an employment and training activity in which supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits are converted to cash shall occur only with the consent of the participant.

            (E) For the purposes of any project conducted under this paragraph, the provisions of this chapter affecting the rights of recipients may be waived to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions of section 402, and sections 481 through 487,1 of the Social Security Act.

            (F) At least 60 days prior to granting final approval of a project under this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish the terms and conditions for any demonstration project conducted under the paragraph for public comment in the Federal Register and shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

            (G) Waivers may be granted under this paragraph to conduct projects at any one time in a total of up to 60 project areas (or parts of project areas), as such areas are defined in regulations in effect on January 1, 1990.

            (H) A waiver for a change in program rules may be granted under this paragraph only for a demonstration project that has been approved by the Secretary, that will be evaluated according to criteria prescribed by the Secretary, and that will be in operation for no more than 4 years.

            (I) The Secretary may not grant a waiver under this paragraph on or after August 22, 1996. Any reference in this paragraph to a provision of title IV of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.\] shall be deemed to be a reference to such provision as in effect on the day before August 22, 1996.

    (c) __Evaluation measures; pilot programs for nutritional monitoring__ 

        The Secretary shall develop and implement measures for evaluating, on an annual or more frequent basis, the effectiveness of the supplemental nutrition assistance program in achieving its stated objectives, including, but not limited to, the program’s impact upon the nutritional and economic status of participating households, the program’s impact upon all sectors of the agricultural economy, including farmers and ranchers, as well as retail food stores, and the program’s relative fairness to households of different income levels, different age composition, different size, and different regions of residence. Further, the Secretary shall, by way of making contracts with or grants to public or private organizations or agencies, implement pilot programs to test various means of measuring on a continuing basis the nutritional status of low income people, with special emphasis on people who are eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance, in order to develop minimum common criteria and methods for systematic nutrition monitoring that could be applied on a nationwide basis. The locations of the pilot programs shall be selected to provide a representative geographic and demographic cross-section of political subdivisions that reflect natural usage patterns of health and nutritional services and that contain high proportions of low income people. The Secretary shall report on the progress of these pilot programs on an annual basis commencing on July 1, 1982, to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, together with such recommendations as the Secretary deems appropriate.

    (d) __Employment initiatives program__ 

        (1) __Election to participate__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, a State may elect to carry out an employment initiatives program under this subsection.

            (B) __Requirement__ 

                A State shall be eligible to carry out an employment initiatives program under this subsection only if not less than 50 percent of the households in the State that received supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits during the summer of 1993 also received benefits under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 601][/us/usc/t42/s601] et seq.) during the summer of 1993.

        (2) __Procedure__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A State that has elected to carry out an employment initiatives program under paragraph (1) may use amounts equal to the allotments that would otherwise be issued to a household under the supplemental nutrition assistance program, but for the operation of this subsection, to provide cash benefits in lieu of the allotments to the household if the household is eligible under paragraph (3).

            (B) __Payment__ 

                The Secretary shall pay to each State that has elected to carry out an employment initiatives program under paragraph (1) an amount equal to the value of the allotment that each household participating in the program in the State would be eligible to receive under this chapter but for the operation of this subsection.

            (C) __Other provisions__ 

            For purposes of the supplemental nutrition assistance program (other than this subsection)—

                (i) cash assistance under this subsection shall be considered to be an allotment; and

                (ii) each household receiving cash benefits under this subsection shall not receive any other supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits during the period for which the cash assistance is provided.

            (D) __Additional payments__ 

            Each State that has elected to carry out an employment initiatives program under paragraph (1) shall—

                (i) increase the cash benefits provided to each household participating in the program in the State under this subsection to compensate for any State or local sales tax that may be collected on purchases of food by the household, unless the Secretary determines on the basis of information provided by the State that the increase is unnecessary on the basis of the limited nature of the items subject to the State or local sales tax; and

                (ii) pay the cost of any increase in cash benefits required by clause (i).

Such studies shall, to the maximum extent possible—

        (1) collect such data for up to 3 years after the individual has completed the employment and training program; and

        (2) yield results that can be generalized to the national program as a whole.

        The results of such studies and reports shall be considered in developing or updating the performance standards required under [section 2015 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015].

    (h) __Demonstration projects for vehicle exclusion limits__ 

    The Secretary shall conduct a sufficient number of demonstration projects to evaluate the effects, in both rural and urban areas, of including in financial resources under [section 2014(g) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2014/g] the fair market value of licensed vehicles to the extent the value of each vehicle exceeds $4,500, but excluding the value of—

        (1) any licensed vehicle that is used to produce earned income, necessary for transportation of an elderly or physically disabled household member, or used as the household’s home; and

        (2) one licensed vehicle used to obtain, continue, or seek employment (including travel to and from work), used to pursue employment-related education or training, or used to secure food or the benefits of the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

    (i) __Testing resource accumulation__ 

        The Secretary shall conduct, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe, for a period not to exceed 4 years, projects to test allowing not more than 11,000 eligible households, in the aggregate, to accumulate resources up to $10,000 each (which shall be excluded from consideration as a resource) for later expenditure for a purpose directly related to improving the education, training, or employability (including self-employment) of household members, for the purchase of a home for the household, for a change of the household’s residence, or for making major repairs to the household’s home.

    (j) __Demonstration projects directed at benefit trafficking__ 

        The Secretary shall use up to $4,000,000 of the funds provided in advance in appropriations Acts for projects authorized by this section to conduct demonstration projects in which State or local supplemental nutrition assistance program agencies test innovative ideas for working with State or local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute benefit trafficking.

    (k) __Pilot projects to evaluate health and nutrition promotion in the supplemental nutrition assistance program__ 

        (1) __In general__

            (B) to reduce overweight, obesity (including childhood obesity), and associated co-morbidities in the United States.

        (2) __Grants__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary may enter into competitively awarded contracts or cooperative agreements with, or provide grants to, public or private organizations or agencies (as defined by the Secretary), for use in accordance with projects that meet the strategy goals of this subsection.

            (B) __Application__ 

                To be eligible to receive a contract, cooperative agreement, or grant under this paragraph, an organization shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.
