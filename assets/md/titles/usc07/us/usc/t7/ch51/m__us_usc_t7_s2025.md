## § 2025. Administrative cost-sharing and quality control

    (a) __Administrative costs__ 

        Subject to subsection (k) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to pay to each State agency an amount equal to 50 per centum of all administrative costs involved in each State agency’s operation of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of (1) the certification of applicant households, (2) the acceptance, storage, protection, control, and accounting of benefits after their delivery to receiving points within the State, (3) the issuance of benefits to all eligible households, (4) informational activities relating to the supplemental nutrition assistance program, including those undertaken under [section 2020(e)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2020/e/1/A], but not including recruitment activities, (5) fair hearings, (6) automated data processing and information retrieval systems subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (g) of this section, (7) supplemental nutrition assistance program investigations and prosecutions, and (8) implementing and operating the immigration status verification system established under section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1320b–7(d)][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–7/d]): Provided, That the Secretary is authorized at the Secretary’s discretion to pay any State agency administering the supplemental nutrition assistance program on all or part of an Indian reservation under [section 2020(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2020/d] or in a Native village within the State of Alaska identified in [section 1610(b) of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s1610/b]. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The period probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  such amounts for administrative costs as the Secretary determines to be necessary for effective operation of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, as well as to permit each State to retain 35 percent of the value of all funds or allotments recovered or collected pursuant to sections 2015(b) and 2022(c) of this title and 20 percent of the value of any other funds or allotments recovered or collected, except the value of funds or allotments recovered or collected that arise from an error of a State agency. The officials responsible for making determinations of ineligibility under this chapter shall not receive or benefit from revenues retained by the State under the provisions of this subsection.

    (b) __Work supplementation or support program__ 

        (1) __“Work supplementation or support program” defined__ 

            In this subsection, the term “work supplementation or support program” means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the supplemental nutrition assistance program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.

        (2) __Program__ 

            A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the supplemental nutrition assistance program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.

        (3) __Procedure__ 

        If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the supplemental nutrition assistance program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program—

            (A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;

            (B) the State agency shall expend the amount received under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the work supplementation or support program in lieu of providing the allotment that the household would receive but for the operation of this subsection;

            (C)

             for purposes of—

                (i) sections 2014 and 2017(a) of this title, the amount received under this subsection shall be excluded from household income and resources; and

                (ii) [section 2017(b) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2017/b], the amount received under this subsection shall be considered to be the value of an allotment provided to the household; and

            (D) the household shall not receive an allotment from the State agency for the period during which the member continues to participate in the work supplementation or support program.

        (4) __Other work requirements__ 

            No individual shall be excused, by reason of the fact that a State has a work supplementation or support program, from any work requirement under [section 2015(d) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/d], except during the periods in which the individual is employed under the work supplementation or support program.

        (5) __Length of participation__ 

            A State agency shall provide a description of how the public assistance recipients in the program shall, within a specific period of time, be moved from supplemented or supported employment to employment that is not supplemented or supported.

        (6) __Displacement__ 

            A work supplementation or support program shall not displace the employment of individuals who are not supplemented or supported.

    (c) __Quality control system__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __System__ 

                In carrying out the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the Secretary shall carry out a system that enhances payment accuracy and improves administration by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high payment error rates to share in the cost of payment error.

            (B) __Adjustment of Federal share of administrative costs for fiscal years before fiscal year 2003__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), with respect to any fiscal year before fiscal year 2003, the Secretary shall adjust a State agency’s federally funded share of administrative costs under subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing that share of all such administrative costs by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full ⅒ of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    Only States with a rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility that is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment under clause (i).

            (C) __Establishment of liability amount for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter__ 

            With respect to fiscal year 2004 and any fiscal year thereafter for which the Secretary determines that, for the second or subsequent consecutive fiscal year, a 95 percent statistical probability exists that the payment error rate of a State agency exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish an amount for which the State agency may be liable (referred to in this paragraph as the “liability amount”) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

                (i) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year;

                (ii)

                 the difference between—

                    (I) the payment error rate of the State agency; and

                    (II) 6 percent; and

                (iii) 10 percent.

            (D) __Authority of Secretary with respect to liability amount__ 

            With respect to the liability amount established for a State agency under subparagraph (C) for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall—

                (i)

                    (I) waive the responsibility of the State agency to pay all or any portion of the liability amount established for the fiscal year (referred to in this paragraph as the “waiver amount”);

                    (II) require that a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the liability amount established for the fiscal year be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program (referred to in this paragraph as the “new investment amount”), which new investment amount shall not be matched by Federal funds;

                    (III) designate a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the amount established for the fiscal year for payment to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (E) (referred to in this paragraph as the “at-risk amount”); or

                    (IV) take any combination of the actions described in subclauses (I) through (III); or

                (ii) make the determinations described in clause (i) and enter into a settlement with the State agency, only with respect to any waiver amount or new investment amount, before the end of the fiscal year in which the liability amount is determined under subparagraph (C).

            (E) __Payment of at-risk amount for certain States__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A State agency shall pay to the Secretary the at-risk amount designated under subparagraph (D)(i)(III) for any fiscal year in accordance with clause (ii), if, with respect to the immediately following fiscal year, a liability amount has been established for the State agency under subparagraph (C).

                (ii) __Method of payment of at-risk amount__ 

                    (I) __Remission to the Secretary__ 

                        In the case of a State agency required to pay an at-risk amount under clause (i), as soon as practicable after completion of all administrative and judicial reviews with respect to that requirement to pay, the chief executive officer of the State shall remit to the Secretary the at-risk amount required to be paid.

                    (II) __Alternative method of collection__ 

                        (aa) __In general__ 

                            If the chief executive officer of the State fails to make the payment under subclause (I) within a reasonable period of time determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the amount required to be paid under clause (i).

                        (bb) __Accrual of interest__ 

                            During any period of time determined by the Secretary under item (aa), interest on the payment under subclause (I) shall not accrue under [section 2022(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2022/a/2].

            (F) __Use of portion of liability amount for new investment__ 

                (i) __Reduction of other amounts due to State agency__ 

                    In the case of a State agency that fails to comply with a requirement for new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II) or clause (iii)(I), the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the portion of the liability amount that has not been used in accordance with that requirement.

                (ii) __Effect of State agency’s wholly prevailing on appeal__ 

                    If a State agency begins required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is reduced to $0 on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was included in the liability amount subject to the appeal.

                (iii) __Effect of Secretary’s wholly prevailing on appeal__ 

                If a State agency does not begin required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is wholly upheld on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall—

                    (I) require all or any portion of the new investment amount to be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which amount shall not be matched by Federal funds; and

                    (II) require payment of any remaining portion of the new investment amount in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii).

                (iv) __Effect of neither party’s wholly prevailing on appeal__ 

                    The Secretary shall promulgate regulations regarding obligations of the Secretary and the State agency in a case in which the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency and neither the Secretary nor the State agency wholly prevails.

            (G) __Corrective action plans__ 

                The Secretary shall foster management improvements by the States by requiring State agencies, other than State agencies with payment error rates of less than 6 percent, to develop and implement corrective action plans to reduce payment errors.

        (2) __Error rate definitions__

            (B)

             the term “overpayment error rate” means the percentage of the value of all allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency that are either—

                (i) issued to households that fail to meet basic program eligibility requirements; or

                (ii) overissued to eligible households; and

            (C) the term “underpayment error rate” means the ratio of the value of allotments underissued to recipient households to the total value of allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency.

        (3) __Exclusions__ 

        The following errors may be measured for management purposes but shall not be included in the payment error rate:

            (A) Any errors resulting in the application of new regulations promulgated under this chapter during the first 120 days from the required implementation date for such regulations.

            (B) Errors resulting from the use by a State agency of correctly processed information concerning households or individuals received from Federal agencies or from actions based on policy information approved or disseminated, in writing, by the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee.

        (4) __Reporting requirements__ 

            The Secretary may require a State agency to report any factors that the Secretary considers necessary to determine a State agency’s payment error rate, liability amount or new investment amount under paragraph (1), or performance under the performance measures under subsection (d) of this section. If a State agency fails to meet the reporting requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall base the determination on all pertinent information available to the Secretary.

        (5) __Procedures__ 

            To facilitate the implementation of this subsection, each State agency shall expeditiously submit to the Secretary data concerning the operations of the State agency in each fiscal year sufficient for the Secretary to establish the State agency’s payment error rate, liability amount or new investment amount under paragraph (1), or performance under the performance measures under subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary shall initiate efforts to collect the amount owed by the State agency as a claim established under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, subject to the conclusion of any formal or informal appeal procedure and administrative or judicial review under [section 2023 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2023] (as provided for in paragraph (7)), before the end of the fiscal year following such fiscal year.

        (6) __National performance measure for payment error rates__ 

            (A) __Announcement__ 

                At the time the Secretary makes the notification to State agencies of their error rates, the Secretary shall also announce a national performance measure that shall be the sum of the products of each State agency’s error rate as developed for the notifications under paragraph (8) times that State agency’s proportion of the total value of national allotments issued for the fiscal year using the most recent issuance data available at the time of the notifications issued pursuant to paragraph (8).

            (B) __Use of alternative measure of State error__ 

                Where a State fails to meet reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (4), the Secretary may use another measure of a State’s error developed pursuant to paragraph (5), to develop the national performance measure.
