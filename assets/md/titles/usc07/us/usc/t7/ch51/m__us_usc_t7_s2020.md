## § 2020. Administration

    (a) __State responsibility__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The State agency of each participating State shall have responsibility for certifying applicant households and issuing EBT cards.

        (2) __Local administration__ 

            The responsibility of the agency of the State government shall not be affected by whether the program is operated on a State-administered or county-administered basis, as provided under section 2012(t)(1)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

        (3) __Records__

            Records described in subparagraph (A) shall—

                (i) be available for inspection and audit at any reasonable time;

                (ii) subject to subsection (e)(8), be available for review in any action filed by a household to enforce any provision of this chapter (including regulations issued under this chapter); and

                (iii) be preserved for such period of not less than 3 years as may be specified in regulations.

        (4) __Review of major changes in program design__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall develop standards for identifying major changes in the operations of a State agency, including—

                (i) large or substantially-increased numbers of low-income households that do not live in reasonable proximity to an office performing the major functions described in subsection (e);

                (ii) substantial increases in reliance on automated systems for the performance of responsibilities previously performed by personnel described in subsection (e)(6)(B);

                (iii) changes that potentially increase the difficulty of reporting information under subsection (e) or [section 2015(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2015/c]; and

                (iv) changes that may disproportionately increase the burdens on any of the types of households described in subsection (e)(2)(A).

            (B) __Notification__ 

            If a State agency implements a major change in operations, the State agency shall—

                (i) notify the Secretary; and

                (ii) collect such information as the Secretary shall require to identify and correct any adverse effects on program integrity or access, including access by any of the types of households described in subsection (e)(2)(A).

    (b) __Correction of improper denials and under­issuances__ 

        When a State agency learns, through its own reviews under [section 2025 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2025] or other reviews, or through other sources, that it has improperly denied, terminated, or underissued benefits to an eligible household, the State agency shall promptly restore any improperly denied benefits to the extent required by subsection (e)(11) and [section 2023(b) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2023/b], and shall take other steps to prevent a recurrence of such errors where such error was caused by the application of State agency practices, rules or procedures inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter or with regulations or policies of the Secretary issued under the authority of this chapter.

    (c) __Civil rights compliance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the certification of applicant households for the supplemental nutrition assistance program, there shall be no discrimination by reason of race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or political affiliation.

        (2) __Relation to other laws__ 

        The administration of the program by a State agency shall be consistent with the rights of households under the following laws (including implementing regulations):

            (A) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 ([42 U.S.C. 6101][/us/usc/t42/s6101] et seq.).

            (B) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ([29 U.S.C. 794][/us/usc/t29/s794]).

            (C) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ([42 U.S.C. 12101][/us/usc/t42/s12101] et seq.).

            (D) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ([42 U.S.C. 2000d][/us/usc/t42/s2000d] et seq.).

    (d) __Plan of operation by State agency; approval by Secretary; Indians__ 

        The State agency (as defined in section 2012(t)(1) 1 of this title) of each State desiring to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program shall submit for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted within the State in every political subdivision. The Secretary may not, as a part of the approval process for a plan of operation, require a State to submit for prior approval by the Secretary the State agency instructions to staff, interpretations of existing policy, State agency methods of administration, forms used by the State agency, or any materials, documents, memoranda, bulletins, or other matter, unless the State determines that the materials, documents, memoranda, bulletins, or other matter alter or amend the State plan of operation or conflict with the rights and levels of benefits to which a household is entitled. In the case of all or part of an Indian reservation, the State agency as defined in section 2012(t)(1) 1 of this title shall be responsible for conducting such program on such reservation unless the Secretary determines that the State agency (as defined in section 2012(t)(1) 1 of this title) is failing, subsequent to August 31, 1964, properly to administer such program on such reservation in accordance with the purposes of this chapter and further determines that the State agency as defined in section 2012(t)(2) 1 of this title is capable of effectively and efficiently conducting such program, in light of the distance of the reservation from State agency-operated certification and issuance centers, the previous experience of such tribal organization in the operation of programs authorized under the Indian Self-Determination Act ([25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450]) and similar Acts of Congress, the tribal organization’s management and fiscal capabilities, and the adequacy of measures taken by the tribal organization to ensure that there shall be no discrimination in the operation of the program on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin, in which event such State agency shall be responsible for conducting such program and submitting for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted. The Secretary, upon the request of a tribal organization, shall provide the designees of such organization with appropriate training and technical assistance to enable them to qualify as expeditiously as possible as a State agency pursuant to section 2012(t)(2) 1 of this title. A State agency, as defined in section 2012(t)(1) 1 of this title, before it submits its plan of operation to the Secretary for the administration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program on all or part of an Indian reservation, shall consult in good faith with the tribal organization about that portion of the State’s plan of operation pertaining to the implementation of the program for members of the tribe, and shall implement the program in a manner that is responsive to the needs of the Indians on the reservation as determined by ongoing consultation with the tribal organization.

    (e) __Requisites of State plan of operation__

            Except in a case of disqualification as a penalty for failure to comply with a public assistance program rule or regulation, no household shall have its application to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program denied nor its benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program terminated solely on the basis that its application to participate has been denied or its benefits have been terminated under any of the programs carried out under the statutes specified in the second sentence of [section 2014(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2014/a] and without a separate determination by the State agency that the household fails to satisfy the eligibility requirements for participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

Such services shall not include making final decisions on household eligibility or benefit levels.

    (n) __Verification by State agencies__

The plan shall be developed and made available for public comment through publication of the proposed plan in the Federal Register not later than October 1, 1986. The Secretary shall complete the plan, taking into consideration public comments received, not later than February 1, 1987. The elements of the plan may include intake procedures, eligibility determinations and calculation of benefits, verification procedures, coordination with related Federal and State programs, the issuance of benefits, reconciliation procedures, the generation of notices, and program reporting. In developing the plan, the Secretary shall take into account automated data processing and information systems already in existence in States and shall provide for consistency with such systems.

        (2) Not later than October 1, 1987, each State agency shall develop and submit to the Secretary for approval a plan for the use of an automated data processing and information retrieval system to administer the supplemental nutrition assistance program in such State. The State plan shall take into consideration the model plan developed by the Secretary under paragraph (1) and shall provide time frames for completion of various phases of the State plan. If a State agency already has a sufficient automated data processing and information retrieval system, the State plan may, subject to the Secretary’s approval, reflect the existing State system.

        (3) Not later than April 1, 1988, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to Congress an evaluation of the degree and sufficiency of each State’s automated data processing and computerized information systems for the administration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, including State plans submitted under paragraph (2). Such report shall include an analysis of additional steps needed for States to achieve effective and cost-efficient data processing and information systems. The Secretary, thereafter, shall periodically update such report.

        (4) Based on the Secretary’s findings in such report submitted under paragraph (3), the Secretary may require a State agency, as necessary to rectify identified shortcomings in the administration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program in the State, except where such direction would displace State initiatives already under way, to take specified steps to automate data processing systems or computerize information systems for the administration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program in the State if the Secretary finds that, in the absence of such systems, there will be program accountability or integrity problems that will substantially affect the administration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program in the State.

        (5)

            (A)

             Subject to subparagraph (B), in the case of a plan for an automated data processing and information retrieval system submitted by a State agency to the Secretary under paragraph (2), such State agency shall—

                (i) commence implementation of its plan not later than October 1, 1988; and

                (ii) meet the time frames set forth in the plan.
