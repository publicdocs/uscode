                    (II)

                     if the applicant for the loan makes an election pursuant to subparagraph (D) to include in the loan agreement the right of the applicant to prepay the loan, a rate equal to the amount by which—

                        (aa) the interest rate on commercial loans for a similar period that afford the borrower such a right; exceeds

                    (I) __Applicant__ 

                        The applicant may not select a term that ends more than 35 years after the beginning of the first term the applicant selects under clause (i).

                    (II) __Secretary__ 

                        The Secretary may prohibit an applicant from selecting a term that would result in the total term of the loan being greater than the expected useful life of the assets being financed.

            (B) __Authority to waive tier requirement__ 

                The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any case in which the Secretary determines (and sets forth the reasons for the waiver in writing) that the requirement would prevent emergency restoration of the telephone system of the applicant or result in severe hardship to the applicant.

            (C) __Effect of lack of funds__

                (ii) if the applicant is eligible for a loan, make a loan to the applicant under this paragraph in an amount equal to the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount of loans for which the applicant is eligible under this paragraph and under [section 948 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s948], as the amount made available for loans under this paragraph for the fiscal year bears to the total amount made available for loans under this paragraph and under [section 948 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s948] for the fiscal year.

            (C) __Effect of lack of funds__ 

                On request of any applicant who is eligible for a loan under this paragraph for which funds are not available, the applicant shall be considered to have applied for a loan guarantee under [section 936 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s936].

                If, not later than 1 year after final regulations are promulgated to carry out this paragraph, any State, either by statute or through the public utility commission of the State, develops a telecommunications modernization plan that meets the requirements of subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall approve the plan for the State.

                (iii) The plan must encourage and improve computer networks and information highways for subscribers in rural areas.

                (iv)

                 The plan must provide for—

                    (I)

                     subscribers in rural areas to be able to receive through telephone lines—

                        (aa) conference calling;

                        (bb) video images; and

                    (II) the proper routing of information to subscribers.

                (v) The plan must provide for uniform deployment schedules to ensure that advanced services are deployed at the same time in rural and nonrural areas.

                (vi) The plan must provide for such additional requirements for service standards as may be required by the Secretary.

            (C) __Finality of approval__ 

                A telecommunications modernization plan approved under subparagraph (A) may not subsequently be disapproved. Notwithstanding paragraphs (1)(A)(iii) and (2)(A)(iii), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be paragraph “(2)(A)(ii)”. </sup></sup>  and section 948(b)(4)(C)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be section “948(b)(4)(B)”. </sup></sup>  of this title, the Secretary and the Governor of the telephone bank may make a loan to a borrower serving a State that does not have a telecommunication modernization plan approved by the Secretary if the loan is made less than 1 year after the Secretary has adopted final regulations implementing this paragraph.
