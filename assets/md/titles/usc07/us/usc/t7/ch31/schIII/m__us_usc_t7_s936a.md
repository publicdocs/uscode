## § 936a. Prepayment of loans

    (a) __Conditions for prepayment__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (c), a borrower of a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed under [section 936 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s936] may prepay such loan (or any loan advance thereunder) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan (or advance), if—

        (1) the loan is outstanding on July 2, 1986;

        (2) private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replace the loan; and

        (3) the borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will be passed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength of the borrower in cases of financial hardship.

    (b) __Charges on prepayment prohibited__ 

        No sums in addition to the payment of the outstanding principal balance due on the loan may be charged as the result of such prepayment against the borrower, the fund, or the Secretary.

    (c) __Disqualification for prepayment on finding of adverse affect on Federal Financing Bank__ 

        (1) A borrower will not qualify for prepayment under this section if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prepay in such borrower’s case would adversely affect the operation of the Federal Financing Bank.

        (2) Paragraph (1) shall be effective in fiscal year 1987 only for any loan the prepayment of the principal amount of which will cause the cumulative amount of net proceeds from all such prepayments made during such year to exceed $2,017,500,000.

    (d) __Amount of permissible prepayments; establishment of eligibility criteria__ 

        (1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a), prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or [Public Law 99–349][/us/pl/99/349] in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.

        (2)

         The Secretary shall establish—

            (A) eligibility criteria to ensure that any loan prepayment activity required to be carried out under this subsection will be directed to those cooperative borrowers in greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment, as determined by the Secretary; and

            (B) such other eligibility criteria as the Secretary determines are necessary to carry out this subsection.

    (e) __Assignability and transferability of guarantees of loans__ 

        Any guarantee of a loan prepaid under this section shall be fully assignable under the provisions of [section 936 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s936] and transferable. However, the Secretary may require that any such guarantee, if transfered  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “transferred”. </sup></sup>  or assigned, be transferred or assigned to a loan or security that, if sold, will be grouped with nonguaranteed loans or securities and sold in a manner to ensure that such sale will not unreasonably compete with the marketing of obligations of the United States.
