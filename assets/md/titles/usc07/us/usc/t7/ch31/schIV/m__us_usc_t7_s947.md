## § 947. Borrowing power; telephone debentures; issuance; interest rates; terms and conditions; ratio to paid-in capital and retained earnings; investments in debentures; debentures as security; purchase and sale of debentures by the Secretary of the Treasury; treatment as public debt transactions of the United States; exclusion of transactions from budget totals

    (a) The telephone bank is authorized to obtain funds through the public or private sale of its bonds, debentures, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness (herein collectively called telephone debentures). Telephone debentures shall be issued at such times, bear interest at such rates, and contain such other terms and conditions as the Telephone Bank Board shall determine: Provided, however, That the amount of the telephone debentures which may be outstanding at any one time pursuant to this section shall not exceed twenty times the paid-in capital and retained earnings of the telephone bank. Telephone debentures shall not be exempt, either as to principal or interest, from any taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State or local taxing authority. Telephone debentures shall be lawful investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds, the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority and control of the United States or any officer or officers thereof.

    (b) The Telephone Bank is also authorized to issue telephone debentures to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury may in his discretion purchase any such debentures, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 as now or hereafter in force are extended to include such purchases. Each purchase of telephone debentures by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the telephone debentures acquired by him under this subsection. All purchases and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such debentures under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.

    (c) Purchases and resales by the Secretary of the Treasury as authorized in subsection (b) of this section shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.
