## § 921a. Policy of financing of rural telephone program

    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress that the growing capital needs of the rural telephone systems require the establishment of a rural telephone bank which will furnish assured and viable sources of supplementary financing with the objective that said bank will become an entirely privately owned, operated, and financed corporation. The Congress further finds that many rural telephone systems require financing under the terms and conditions provided in this subchapter.
