## § 911. Acceptance of services of Federal or State officers; application of civil service laws; expenditures for supplies and equipment

    In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter the Secretary may accept and utilize such voluntary and uncompensated services of Federal, State, and local officers and employees as are available, and he may appoint and fix the compensation of attorneys, engineers, and experts and he may, subject to the civil-service laws, appoint such other officers and employees as he may find necessary and prescribe their duties. The Secretary is authorized, from sums appropriated pursuant to [section 906 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s906], to make such expenditures (including expenditures for personal services; supplies and equipment; lawbooks and books of reference; directories and periodicals; travel expenses; rental at the seat of government and elsewhere; the purchase, operation, or maintenance of passenger-carrying vehicles; and printing and binding) as are appropriate and necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

([May 20, 1936, ch. 432][/us/act/1936-05-20/ch432], title I, § 11, [49 Stat. 1366][/us/stat/49/1366]; [Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 776][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch776], § 2, [63 Stat. 948][/us/stat/63/948]; [Pub. L. 103–354, title II][/us/pl/103/354/tII], § 235(a)(13), Oct. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 3221][/us/stat/108/3221].)

 __Codification__ 

    Provisions which authorized the appointment and fixing of compensation of attorneys, engineers, and experts “without regard to the provisions of the civil service laws applicable to officers and employees of the United States” were omitted from the Code as obsolete and superseded. Such appointments are now subject to the civil service laws unless specifically excepted by those laws or by laws enacted subsequent to Executive Order 8743, Apr. 23, 1941, issued by the President pursuant to [act Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I][/us/act/1940-11-26/ch919/tI], § 1, [54 Stat. 1211][/us/stat/54/1211], which covered most excepted positions into the classified (competitive) civil service. The Order is set out as a note under [section 3301 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3301], Government Organization and Employees. As to the compensation of such personnel, sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5. [Section 5102 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5102] now contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and [section 5103 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5103] authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–354][/us/pl/103/354] substituted “Secretary” for “Administrator” in two places.

    1949—Act Oct. 28, 1949, inserted “title I,” in credit of act May 20, 1936.
