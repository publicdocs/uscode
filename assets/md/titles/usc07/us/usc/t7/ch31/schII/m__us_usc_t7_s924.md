 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 153 of title 47][/us/usc/t47/s153], referred to in subsec. (a), was subsequently amended and no longer contains a subsec. (o). However, the term “broadcasting” is defined elsewhere in that section.

    1990—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 101–624][/us/pl/101/624] inserted “or reception” after “transmission” and “data,” after “voice,”, and substituted “by wire, fiber, radio, light, or other visual or electromagnetic means” for “through the use of electricity between the transmitting and receiving apparatus”.

    1962—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 87–862][/us/pl/87/862] included the transmission of sounds, signals, pictures, writing, or signs of all kinds within “telephone service”, and substituted “message telegram service or community antenna television system services or facilities other than those intended exclusively for educational purposes” for “telegraph services or facilities”.
