    (b) __Ascertainment of entitlement__ 

        On or before the first day of October in each year after the passage of sections 361a to 361i of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture shall ascertain as to each State whether it is entitled to receive its share of the annual appropriations for agricultural experiment stations under said sections and the amount which thereupon each is entitled, respectively, to receive.

        (2) __Failure to expend full allotment__ 

            (A) __In general__
