    (b) __Computation__ 

    A loan deficiency payment under this section shall be computed by multiplying—

        (1) the loan payment rate determined under subsection (c) of this section for the loan commodity; by

        (2) the quantity of the loan commodity produced by the eligible producers, excluding any quantity for which the producers obtain a loan under [section 7231 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7231].

    (c) __Loan payment rate__ 

    For purposes of this section, the loan payment rate shall be the amount by which—

        A payment to a producer eligible for a payment under subsection (a)(2) of this section that harvested a commodity on or before the date that is 30 days after the promulgation of the regulations implementing subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be determined as the date the producer lost beneficial interest in the commodity, as determined by the Secretary.

    (f) __Beneficial interest__ 

        Subject to subsection (e) of this section, a producer shall be eligible for a payment under this section only if the producer has a beneficial interest in the commodity, as determined by the Secretary.

    (g) __Effective date for payment rate determination__ 

    For the 2001 crop year, the Secretary shall determine the amount of the loan deficiency payment to be made under this section to the producers on a farm with respect to a quantity of a loan commodity using the payment rate in effect under subsection (c) of this section as of the earlier of the following:
