        A loan under this section during any fiscal year shall be made available not earlier than the beginning of the fiscal year and shall mature at the earlier of—

            (A) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the first day of the first month after the month in which the loan is made; or

        (2) __Supplemental loans__ 

        In the case of a loan made under this section in the last 3 months of a fiscal year, the processor may repledge the sugar as collateral for a second loan in the subsequent fiscal year, except that the second loan shall—

            (A) be made at the loan rate in effect at the time the first loan was made; and

            (B) mature in 9 months less the quantity of time that the first loan was in effect.

    (d) __Loan type; processor assurances__ 

        (1) __Nonrecourse loans__ 

            The Secretary shall carry out this section through the use of nonrecourse loans.

        (2) __Processor assurances__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary shall obtain from each processor that receives a loan under this section such assurances as the Secretary considers adequate to ensure that the processor will provide payments to producers that are proportional to the value of the loan received by the processor for the sugar beets and sugarcane delivered by producers to the processor.

            (B) __Minimum payments__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may establish appropriate minimum payments for purposes of this paragraph.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    In the case of sugar beets, the minimum payment established under clause (i) shall not exceed the rate of payment provided for under the applicable contract between a sugar beet producer and a sugar beet processor.

        (3) __Administration__ 

            The Secretary may not impose or enforce any prenotification requirement, or similar administrative requirement not otherwise in effect on May 13, 2002, that has the effect of preventing a processor from electing to forfeit the loan collateral (of an acceptable grade and quality) on the maturity of the loan.

    (e) __Loans for in-process sugar__ 

        (1) __Definition of in-process sugars and syrups__ 

            In this subsection, the term “in-process sugars and syrups” does not include raw sugar, liquid sugar, invert sugar, invert syrup, or other finished product that is otherwise eligible for a loan under subsection (a) or (b).

        (2) __Availability__ 

            The Secretary shall make nonrecourse loans available to processors of a crop of domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets for in-process sugars and syrups derived from the crop.

        (3) __Loan rate__ 

            The loan rate shall be equal to 80 percent of the loan rate applicable to raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the source material for the in-process sugars and syrups.

        (4) __Further processing on forfeiture__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                As a condition of the forfeiture of in-process sugars and syrups serving as collateral for a loan under paragraph (2), the processor shall, within such reasonable time period as the Secretary may prescribe and at no cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation, convert the in-process sugars and syrups into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar of acceptable grade and quality for sugars eligible for loans under subsection (a) or (b).

            (B) __Transfer to corporation__ 

                Once the in-process sugars and syrups are fully processed into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, the processor shall transfer the sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation.

            (C) __Payment to processor__ 

            On transfer of the sugar, the Secretary shall make a payment to the processor in an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying—

                (i)

                 the difference between—

                    (I) the loan rate for raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as appropriate; and

                    (II) the loan rate the processor received under paragraph (3); by

                (ii) the quantity of sugar transferred to the Secretary.

        (5) __Loan conversion__ 

            If the processor does not forfeit the collateral as described in paragraph (4), but instead further processes the in-process sugars and syrups into raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar and repays the loan on the in-process sugars and syrups, the processor may obtain a loan under subsection (a) or (b) for the raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as appropriate.

        (6) __Term of loan__ 

            The term of a loan made under this subsection for a quantity of in-process sugars and syrups, when combined with the term of a loan made with respect to the raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar derived from the in-process sugars and syrups, may not exceed 9 months, consistent with subsection (c).

    (f) __Avoiding forfeitures; Corporation inventory disposition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to subsection (d)(3), to the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall operate the program established under this section at no cost to the Federal Government by avoiding the forfeiture of sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation.

        (2) __Inventory disposition__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                To carry out paragraph (1), the Commodity Credit Corporation may accept bids to obtain raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar in the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation from (or otherwise make available such commodities, on appropriate terms and conditions, to) processors of sugarcane and processors of sugar beets (acting in conjunction with the producers of the sugarcane or sugar beets processed by the processors) in return for the reduction of production of raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar, as appropriate.

            (B) __Bioenergy feedstock__ 

                If a reduction in the quantity of production accepted under subparagraph (A) involves sugar beets or sugarcane that has already been planted, the sugar beets or sugarcane so planted may not be used for any commercial purpose other than as a bioenergy feedstock.

            (C) __Additional authority__ 

                The authority provided under this paragraph is in addition to any authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation under any other law.

    (g) __Information reporting__ 

        (1) __Duty of processors and refiners to report__ 

            A sugarcane processor, cane sugar refiner, and sugar beet processor shall furnish the Secretary, on a monthly basis, such information as the Secretary may require to administer sugar programs, including the quantity of purchases of sugarcane, sugar beets, and sugar, and production, importation, distribution, and stock levels of sugar.

        (2) __Duty of producers to report__ 

            (A) __Proportionate share States__ 

                As a condition of a loan made to a processor for the benefit of a producer, the Secretary shall require each producer of sugarcane located in a State (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) in which there are in excess of 250 producers of sugarcane to report, in the manner prescribed by the Secretary, the sugarcane yields and acres planted to sugarcane of the producer.

            (B) __Other States__
