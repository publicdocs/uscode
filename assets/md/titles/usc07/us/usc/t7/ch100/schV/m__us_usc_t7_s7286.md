            At the option of a producer, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make negotiable certificates authorized under subsection (b)(3) available to the producer, in the form of program payments or by sale, in a manner that the Corporation determines will encourage the orderly marketing of commodities pledged as collateral for loans made to producers under subchapter III of this chapter, title I of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \[[7 U.S.C. 7901][/us/usc/t7/s7901] et seq.\], title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 \[[7 U.S.C. 8701][/us/usc/t7/s8701] et seq.\], and Subtitle 1 B of title I of the Agricultural Act of 2014 \[[7 U.S.C. 9031][/us/usc/t7/s9031] et seq.\].
