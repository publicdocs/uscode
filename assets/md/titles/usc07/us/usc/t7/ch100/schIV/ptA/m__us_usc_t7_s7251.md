## § 7251. Milk price support program

    (a) __Support activities__ 

        The Secretary of Agriculture shall support the price of milk produced in the 48 contiguous States through the purchase of cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk produced from the milk.

    (b) __Rate__ 

    The price of milk shall be supported at the following rates per hundredweight for milk containing 3.67 percent butterfat:

        (1) During calendar year 1996, $10.35.

        (2) During calendar year 1997, $10.20.

        (3) During calendar year 1998, $10.05.

        (4) During each of calendar years 1999 through 2001, $9.90.

        (5) During the period beginning on January 1, 2002, and ending on May 31, 2002, $9.90.

    (c) __Purchase prices__ 

        The support purchase prices under this section for each of the products of milk (butter, cheese, and nonfat dry milk) announced by the Secretary shall be the same for all of that product sold by persons offering to sell the product to the Secretary. The purchase prices shall be sufficient to enable plants of average efficiency to pay producers, on average, a price that is not less than the rate of price support for milk in effect under subsection (b).

    (d) __Special rule for butter and nonfat dry milk purchase prices__ 

        (1) __Allocation of purchase prices__ 

            The Secretary may allocate the rate of price support between the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter in a manner that will result in the lowest level of expenditures by the Commodity Credit Corporation or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary considers appropriate. Not later than 10 days after making or changing an allocation, the Secretary shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate of the allocation. [Section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] shall not apply with respect to the implementation of this section.

        (2) __Timing of purchase price adjustments__ 

            The Secretary may make any such adjustments in the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter the Secretary considers to be necessary not more than twice in each calendar year.

    (e) __Refunds of 1995 and 1996 assessments__ 

        (1) __Refund required__ 

            The Secretary shall provide for a refund of the entire reduction required under section 204(h)(2) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 ([7 U.S.C. 1446e(h)(2)][/us/usc/t7/s1446e/h/2]), as in effect on the day before the amendment made by subsection (g), in the price of milk received by a producer during calendar year 1995 or 1996, if the producer provides evidence that the producer did not increase marketings in calendar year 1995 or 1996 when compared to calendar year 1994 or 1995, respectively.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            This subsection shall not apply with respect to a producer for a particular calendar year if the producer has already received a refund under section 204(h) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 for the same fiscal year before the effective date of this section.

        (3) __Treatment of refund__ 

            A refund under this subsection shall not be considered as any type of price support or payment for purposes of sections 3811 and 3821 of title 16.

    (f) __Commodity Credit Corporation__ 

        The Secretary shall carry out the program authorized by this section through the Commodity Credit Corporation.

    (g) __Omitted__ 

    (h) __Period of effectiveness__ 

        This section (other than subsection (g)) shall be effective only during the period beginning on the first day of the first month beginning after April 4, 1996, and ending on May 31, 2002. The program authorized by this section shall terminate on May 31, 2002, and shall be considered to have expired notwithstanding [section 907 of title 2][/us/usc/t2/s907].
