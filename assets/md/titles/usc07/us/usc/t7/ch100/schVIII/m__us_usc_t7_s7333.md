                (i) on which the plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing; and

                (ii) that has never been tilled, or the producer cannot substantiate that the ground has ever been tilled, for the production of an annual crop as of the date of enactment of this paragraph.

            (B) __Reduction in benefits__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    During the first 4 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop after February 7, 2014, shall be subject to a reduction in benefits under this section as described in this subparagraph.

                (ii) __De minimis acreage exemption__

        (2) __Actual production history__ 

            The Secretary shall determine yield coverage using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.

        (3) __Assignment of yield__ 

            If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.

        (4) __Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) __Documentation__ 

                    If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

                (ii) __Prohibition__ 

                    Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.

            (B) __Exception__

                    (I) the County Executive Director and the State Executive Director recommend an exemption from the requirement to the Administrator of the Agency; and

                    (II) the Administrator approves the recommendation.

        (5) __Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield__ 

            A producer who receives an assigned yield for the current year of a natural disaster because required production records were not submitted to the local office of the Department shall not be eligible for an assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless the required production records of the previous 1 or more years (as applicable) are provided to the local office.

        (6) __Yield variations due to different farming practices__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

    (f) __Contract payments__ 

        A producer who has received a guaranteed payment for production, as opposed to delivery, of a crop pursuant to a contract shall have the production of the producer adjusted upward by the amount of the production equal to the amount of the contract payment received.

    (g) __Use of Commodity Credit Corporation__ 

        The Secretary may use the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out this section.

    (h) __Exclusions__ 

    Noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section shall not cover losses due to—

        (1) the neglect or malfeasance of the producer;

        (2) the failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in those areas and under such circumstances where it is customary to reseed; or

        (3) the failure of the producer to follow good farming practices, as determined by the Secretary.

    (i) __Payment and income limitations__ 

        (1) __Definitions__ 

            In this subsection, the terms “legal entity” and “person” have the meanings given those terms in [section 1308(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1308/a].

        (3) __Limitation on multiple benefits for same loss__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a producer who is eligible to receive benefits under this section is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program administered by the Secretary, the producer shall be required to elect whether to receive benefits under this section or under the other program, but not both.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to emergency loans under subtitle C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act ([7 U.S.C. 1961][/us/usc/t7/s1961] et seq.).
