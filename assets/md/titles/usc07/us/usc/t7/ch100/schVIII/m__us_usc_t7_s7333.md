            (B) __Ineligibility for benefits__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Subject to clause (ii) and subparagraph (C), native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop after the date of enactment of this paragraph shall be ineligible during the first 5 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, for benefits under—

                    (I) this section; and

        (2) __Records__ 

            To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer shall provide annually to the Secretary records of crop acreage, acreage yields, and production for each crop, as required by the Secretary.

        (3) __Acreage reports__ 

            A producer shall provide annual reports on acreage planted or prevented from being planted, as required by the Secretary, by the designated acreage reporting date for the crop and location as established by the Secretary.

    (c) __Loss requirements__ 

        (1) __Cause__ 

            To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer of an eligible crop shall have suffered a loss of a noninsured commodity as the result of a cause described in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

        (4) __Area trigger__ 

            The Secretary shall provide assistance to individual producers without any requirement of an area loss.

    (d) __Payment__ 

    The Secretary shall make available to a producer eligible for noninsured assistance under this section a payment computed by multiplying—

        (1) the quantity that is less than 50 percent of the established yield for the crop; by

        (2)

            (A) in the case of each of the 1996 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); or

            (B) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, 55 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); by

        (3)

         a payment rate for the type of crop (as determined by the Secretary) that—

            (A)

             in the case of a crop that is produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, reflects the decreasing cost incurred in the production cycle for the crop that is—

        (1) __Establishment__ 

            The Secretary shall establish farm yields for purposes of providing noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section.

        (2) __Actual production history__ 

            The Secretary shall determine yield coverage using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.

        (3) __Assignment of yield__ 

            If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.

        (4) __Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                (i) __Documentation__ 

                    If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

                (ii) __Prohibition__ 

                    Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            A crop or a producer shall not be subject to this subsection if—

                (i) the planted acreage of the producer for the crop has been inspected by a third party acceptable to the Secretary; or

                (ii)

                    (I) the County Executive Director and the State Executive Director recommend an exemption from the requirement to the Administrator of the Agency; and

                    (II) the Administrator approves the recommendation.

        (5) __Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield__ 

            A producer who receives an assigned yield for the current year of a natural disaster because required production records were not submitted to the local office of the Department shall not be eligible for an assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless the required production records of the previous 1 or more years (as applicable) are provided to the local office.

        (6) __Yield variations due to different farming practices__ 

            The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

    (f) __Contract payments__ 

        A producer who has received a guaranteed payment for production, as opposed to delivery, of a crop pursuant to a contract shall have the production of the producer adjusted upward by the amount of the production equal to the amount of the contract payment received.

    (g) __Use of Commodity Credit Corporation__ 

        The Secretary may use the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out this section.

    Noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section shall not cover losses due to—

        (1) the neglect or malfeasance of the producer;

        (2) the failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in those areas and under such circumstances where it is customary to reseed; or

        (3) the failure of the producer to follow good farming practices, as determined by the Secretary.

    (i) __Payment and income limitations__ 

        (1) __Definitions__ 

            In this subsection, the terms “legal entity” and “person” have the meanings given those terms in [section 1308(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1308/a].

        (3) __Limitation on multiple benefits for same loss__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a producer who is eligible to receive benefits under this section is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program administered by the Secretary, the producer shall be required to elect whether to receive benefits under this section or under the other program, but not both.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to emergency loans under subtitle C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act ([7 U.S.C. 1961][/us/usc/t7/s1961] et seq.).

        (4) __Adjusted gross income limitation__ 

            A person or legal entity that has an average adjusted gross income in excess of the average adjusted gross income limitation applicable under [section 1308–3a(b)(1)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1308–3a/b/1/A], or a successor provision, shall not be eligible to receive noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section.
