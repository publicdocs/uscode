## § 55. Fees and charges for cotton classing and related services; criteria; disposition of moneys and samples

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall cause to be collected such fees and charges for licenses issued to classifiers of cotton under [section 53 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s53], for determinations made under [section 54 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s54], and for the establishment of standards and sale of copies of standards under sections 56, 57, and 57a of this title, as will cover, as nearly as practicable, and after taking into consideration net proceeds from any sale of samples, the costs incident to providing services and standards under such sections, including administrative and supervisory costs. The Secretary may provide by regulation conditions under which cotton samples submitted or used in the performance of services authorized by this chapter shall become the property of the United States and may be sold with the proceeds credited to the foregoing account: Provided, That such cotton samples shall not be subject to the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41. Any fees or charges, late payment penalties, or proceeds from the sales of samples collected under this subsection, and any interest earned through the investment of such funds shall be credited to the current appropriation account that incurs the costs of the services provided under this chapter, and shall remain available without fiscal year limitation to pay the expenses of the Secretary incident to providing services and standards under this chapter and [section 15b of this title][/us/usc/t7/s15b]. Such funds may be invested by the Secretary in insured or fully collateralized, interest-bearing accounts or, at the discretion of the Secretary, by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States Government debt instruments.

    (b) The price established by the Secretary of Agriculture under the foregoing provisions of this section for practical forms representing the official cotton standards of the United States shall cover, as nearly as practicable, the estimated actual cost to the Department of Agriculture for developing and preparing such practical forms.
