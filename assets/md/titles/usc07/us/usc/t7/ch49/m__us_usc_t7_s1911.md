## § 1911. Consultation of Secretary of Agriculture with farmers, farm and commodity organizations and other persons and organizations; travel and per diem expenses

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever the Secretary of Agriculture determines that additional legislative authority is necessary to develop new agricultural programs involving supply adjustments or marketing regulations through marketing orders, marketing quotas, or price support programs with respect to any agricultural commodity, or to make substantial revisions in any existing agricultural legislation or programs, he may consult and advise with farmers, farm organizations, and appropriate commodity organizations, if any, for the commodity involved, to review the problems involved, the need for new legislation, and the provisions which should be included in any such proposed legislation.

    (b) In addition, whenever and to the extent he deems such action necessary or desirable, the Secretary of Agriculture may consult and advise with any person or group of persons, or organizations, including farmers, handlers, processors, or others connected with the production, processing, handling, or use of the commodity involved, with respect to the problems involved and need for legislation and the provisions which should be included in any such proposed legislation.

    (c) In order that the Secretary of Agriculture may be assured of being able to obtain the advice of any such person or organization, he is authorized, whenever he determines such action necessary, to pay for each day’s attendance at meetings and while traveling to and from such meetings, transportation expenses and in lieu of subsistence, a per diem in the amount authorized under subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5 for Federal employees. No salary or other compensation shall be paid.
