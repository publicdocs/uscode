## § 1508. Crop insurance

    (a) __Authority to offer insurance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If sufficient actuarial data are available (as determined by the Corporation), the Corporation may insure, or provide reinsurance for insurers of, producers of agricultural commodities grown in the United States under 1 or more plans of insurance determined by the Corporation to be adapted to the agricultural commodity concerned. To qualify for coverage under a plan of insurance, the losses of the insured commodity must be due to drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary).

        (2) __Period__ 

            Except in the cases of tobacco, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, insurance shall not extend beyond the period during which the insured commodity is in the field. As used in the preceding sentence, in the case of an aquacultural species, the term “field” means the environment in which the commodity is produced.

        (3) __Exclusion of losses due to certain actions of producer__ 

            (A) __Exclusions__ 

            Insurance provided under this subsection shall not cover losses due to—

                (i) the neglect or malfeasance of the producer;

                (ii) the failure of the producer to reseed to the same crop in such areas and under such circumstances as it is customary to reseed; or

                (iii) the failure of the producer to follow good farming practices, including scientifically sound sustainable and organic farming practices.

            (B) __Good farming practices__ 

                (i) __Informal administrative process__ 

                    A producer shall have the right to a review of a determination regarding good farming practices made under subparagraph (A)(iii) in accordance with an informal administrative process to be established by the Corporation.

                (ii) __Administrative review__ 

                    (I) __No adverse decision__ 

                        The determination shall not be considered an adverse decision for purposes of subtitle H of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 ([7 U.S.C. 6991][/us/usc/t7/s6991] et seq.).

                    (II) __Reversal or modification__ 

                        Except as provided in clause (i), the determination may not be reversed or modified as the result of a subsequent administrative review.

                (iii) __Judicial review__ 

                    (I) __Right to review__ 

                        A producer shall have the right to judicial review of the determination without exhausting any right to a review under clause (i).

                    (II) __Reversal or modification__ 

                        The determination may not be reversed or modified as the result of judicial review unless the determination is found to be arbitrary or capricious.

            (C) __Limitation on revenue coverage for potatoes__ 

                No policy or plan of insurance provided under this subchapter (including a policy or plan of insurance approved by the Board under subsection (h) of this section) shall cover losses due to a reduction in revenue for potatoes except as covered under a whole farm policy or plan of insurance, as determined by the Corporation.

        (4) __Expansion to other areas or single producers__ 

            (A) __Area expansion__ 

                The Corporation may offer plans of insurance or reinsurance for production of agricultural commodities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau in the same manner as provided in this section for production of agricultural commodities in the United States.

            (B) __Producer expansion__ 

                In an area in the United States or specified in subparagraph (A) where crop insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity, the Corporation may offer to enter into a written agreement with an individual producer operating in the area for insurance coverage under this subchapter if the producer has actuarially sound data relating to the production by the producer of the commodity or similar commodities and the data is acceptable to the Corporation.

        (5) __Dissemination of crop insurance information__ 

            (A) __Available information__ 

            The Corporation shall make available to producers through local offices of the Department—

                (i) current and complete information on all aspects of Federal crop insurance; and

                (ii) a listing of insurance agents and companies offering to sell crop insurance in the area of the producers.

    (b) __Catastrophic risk protection__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Corporation shall offer a catastrophic risk protection plan to indemnify producers for crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, when the producer is unable, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary), to plant other crops for harvest on the acreage for the crop year.

        (2) __Amount of coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Subject to subparagraph (B)—

                (i) in the case of each of the 1995 through 1998 crop years, catastrophic risk protection shall offer a producer coverage for a 50 percent loss in yield, on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 60 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage (as determined by the Corporation); and

                (ii) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, catastrophic risk protection shall offer a producer coverage for a 50 percent loss in yield, on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 55 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage (as determined by the Corporation).

            (B) __Reduction in actual payment__ 

                The amount paid to a producer on a claim under catastrophic risk protection may reflect a reduction that is proportional to the out-of-pocket expenses that are not incurred by the producer as a result of not planting, growing, or harvesting the crop for which the claim is made, as determined by the Corporation.

        (3) __Alternative catastrophic coverage__ 

        Beginning with the 2001 crop year, the Corporation shall offer producers of an agricultural commodity the option of selecting either of the following:

                (ii) at the option of the Secretary that is based on considerations of need, local offices of the Department.

            (B) __Need__ 

                For purposes of considering need under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary may take into account the most efficient and cost-effective use of resources, the availability of personnel, fairness to local producers, the needs and convenience of local producers, and the availability of private insurance carriers.

            (C) __Delivery of coverage__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In full consultation with approved insurance providers, the Secretary may continue to offer catastrophic risk protection in a State (or a portion of a State) through local offices of the Department if the Secretary determines that there is an insufficient number of approved insurance providers operating in the State or portion of the State to adequately provide catastrophic risk protection coverage to producers.

                (ii) __Coverage by approved insurance providers__ 

                    To the extent that catastrophic risk protection coverage by approved insurance providers is sufficiently available in a State (or a portion of a State) as determined by the Secretary, only approved insurance providers may provide the coverage in the State or portion of the State.

                (iii) __Timing of determinations__ 

                    Not later than 90 days after April 4, 1996, the Secretary shall announce the results of the determinations under clause (i) for policies for the 1997 crop year. For subsequent crop years, the Secretary shall make the announcement not later than April 30 of the year preceding the year in which the crop will be produced, or at such other times during the year as the Secretary finds practicable in consultation with affected crop insurance providers for those States (or portions of States) in which catastrophic coverage remains available through local offices of the Department.

                (iv) __Current policies__ 

                    This clause shall take effect beginning with the 1997 crop year. Subject to clause (ii) all catastrophic risk protection policies written by local offices of the Department shall be transferred to the approved insurance provider for performance of all sales, service, and loss adjustment functions. Any fees in connection with such policies that are not yet collected at the time of the transfer shall be payable to the approved insurance providers assuming the policies. The transfer process for policies for the 1997 crop year with sales closing dates before January 1, 1997, shall begin at the time of the Secretary’s announcement under clause (iii) and be completed by the sales closing date for the crop and county. The transfer process for all subsequent policies (including policies for the 1998 and subsequent crop years) shall begin at a date that permits the process to be completed not later than 45 days before the sales closing date.

        (5) __Administrative fee__ 

            (A) __Basic fee__ 

                Each producer shall pay an administrative fee for catastrophic risk protection in the amount of $300 per crop per county.

            (B) __Payment of catastrophic risk protection fee on behalf of producers__ 

                (i) __Payment authorized__ 

                    If State law permits a licensing fee to be paid by an insurance provider to a cooperative association or trade association and rebated to a producer through the payment of catastrophic risk protection administrative fees, a cooperative association or trade association located in that State may pay, on behalf of a member of the association in that State or a contiguous State who consents to be insured under such an arrangement, all or a portion of the administrative fee required by this paragraph for catastrophic risk protection.

                (ii) __Selection of provider__ 

                    Nothing in this subparagraph limits the option of a producer to select the licensed insurance agent or other approved insurance provider from whom the producer will purchase a policy or plan of insurance or to refuse coverage for which a payment is offered to be made under clause (i).

                (iii) __Delivery of insurance__ 

                    Catastrophic risk protection coverage for which a payment is made under clause (i) shall be delivered by a licensed insurance agent or other approved insurance provider.

                (iv) __Additional coverage encouraged__ 

                    A cooperative association or trade association, and any approved insurance provider with whom a licensing fee is made, shall encourage producer members to purchase appropriate levels of coverage in order to meet the risk management needs of the member producers.

            (C) __Time for payment__ 

                The administrative fee required by this paragraph shall be paid by the producer on the same date on which the premium for a policy of additional coverage would be paid by the producer.

            (D) __Use of fees__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The amounts paid under this paragraph shall be deposited in the crop insurance fund established under [section 1516(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1516/c], to be available for the programs and activities of the Corporation.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    No funds deposited in the crop insurance fund under this subparagraph may be used to compensate an approved insurance provider or agent for the delivery of services under this subsection.

            (E) __Waiver of fee__ 

                The Corporation shall waive the amounts required under this paragraph for limited resource farmers, as defined by the Corporation.

        (6) __Participation requirement__ 

            A producer may obtain catastrophic risk coverage for a crop of the producer on land in the county only if the producer obtains the coverage for the crop on all insurable land of the producer in the county.

        (7) __Eligibility for Department programs__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Effective for the spring-planted 1996 and subsequent crops (and fall-planted 1996 crops at the option of the Secretary), to be eligible for any payment or loan under the Agricultural Market Transition Act \[[7 U.S.C. 7201][/us/usc/t7/s7201] et seq.\], for the conservation reserve program, or for any benefit described in [section 2008f of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2008f], a person shall—

                (i) obtain at least the catastrophic level of insurance for each crop of economic significance in which the person has an interest; or

                (ii) provide a written waiver to the Secretary that waives any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

            (B) __“Crop of economic significance” defined__ 

                As used in this paragraph, the term “crop of economic significance” means a crop that has contributed, or is expected to contribute, 10 percent or more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer.

        (8) __Limitation due to risk__ 

            The Corporation may limit catastrophic risk coverage in any county or area, or on any farm, on the basis of the insurance risk concerned.

        (9) __Transitional coverage for 1995 crops__ 

            Effective only for a 1995 crop planted or for which insurance attached prior to January 1, 1995, the Corporation shall allow producers of the crops until not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 \[Oct. 13, 1994\] to obtain catastrophic risk protection for the crop. On enactment of such Act, a producer who made timely purchases of a crop insurance policy before the date of enactment of such Act, under the provisions of this subchapter then in effect, shall be eligible for the same benefits to which a producer would be entitled under comparable additional coverage under subsection (c) of this section.

        (10) __Simplification__ 

            (A) __Catastrophic risk protection plans__ 

                In developing and carrying out the policies and procedures for a catastrophic risk protection plan under this subchapter, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize the paperwork required and the complexity and costs of procedures governing applications for, processing, and servicing of the plan for all parties involved.

            (B) __Other plans__ 

                To the extent that the policies and procedures developed under subparagraph (A) may be applied to other plans of insurance offered under this subchapter without jeopardizing the actuarial soundness or integrity of the crop insurance program, the Corporation shall apply the policies and procedures to the other plans of insurance within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Corporation) after the effective date of this paragraph.

        (11) __Loss adjustment__ 

            The rate for reimbursing an approved insurance provider or agent for expenses incurred by the approved insurance provider or agent for loss adjustment in connection with a policy of catastrophic risk protection shall not exceed 6 percent of the premium for catastrophic risk protection that is used to define loss ratio.

    (c) __General coverage levels__ 

        (1) __Additional coverage generally__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Corporation shall offer to producers of agricultural commodities grown in the United States plans of crop insurance that provide additional coverage.

            (B) __Purchase__ 

                To be eligible for additional coverage, a producer must apply to an approved insurance provider for purchase of additional coverage if the coverage is available from an approved insurance provider. If additional coverage is unavailable privately, the Corporation may offer additional coverage plans of insurance directly to producers.

        (2) __Transfer of relevant information__ 

            If a producer has already applied for catastrophic risk protection at the local office of the Department and elects to purchase additional coverage, the relevant information for the crop of the producer shall be transferred to the approved insurance provider servicing the additional coverage crop policy.

        (3) __Yield and loss basis__ 

            A producer shall have the option of purchasing additional coverage based on an individual yield and loss basis or on an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered by the Corporation.

        (4) __Level of coverage__ 

            The level of coverage shall be dollar denominated and may be purchased at any level not to exceed 85 percent of the individual yield or 95 percent of the area yield (as determined by the Corporation). Not later than the beginning of the 1996 crop year, the Corporation shall provide producers with information on catastrophic risk and additional coverage in terms of dollar coverage (within the allowable limits of coverage provided in this paragraph).

        (5) __Expected market price__ 

            (A) __Establishment or approval__ 

                For the purposes of this subchapter, the Corporation shall establish or approve the price level (referred to in this subchapter as the “expected market price”) of each agricultural commodity for which insurance is offered.

            (B) __General rule__ 

                Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (C), the expected market price of an agricultural commodity shall be not less than the projected market price of the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation.

            (C) __Other authorized approaches__ 

            The expected market price of an agricultural commodity—

                (i) may be based on the actual market price of the agricultural commodity at the time of harvest, as determined by the Corporation;

                (ii) in the case of revenue and other similar plans of insurance, may be the actual market price of the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation;

                (iii) in the case of cost of production or similar plans of insurance, shall be the projected cost of producing the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation; or

                (iv) in the case of other plans of insurance, may be an appropriate amount, as determined by the Corporation.

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Corporation shall contract individually with 5 expert reviewers described in subclause (II) to develop and recommend a methodology for determining an expected market price for sorghum for both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance to more accurately reflect the actual price at harvest.

                    (II) __Requirements__ 

                    The expert reviewers under subclause (I) shall be comprised of agricultural economists with experience in grain sorghum and corn markets, of whom—

                        (aa) 2 shall be agricultural economists of institutions of higher education;

                        (bb) 2 shall be economists from within the Department; and

                        (cc) 1 shall be an economist nominated by the grain sorghum industry.

                (iii) __Recommendations__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Not later than 90 days after the date of contracting with the expert reviewers under clause (ii), the expert reviewers shall submit, and the Corporation shall make available to the public, the recommendations of the expert reviewers.

                    (II) __Consideration__ 

                        The Corporation shall consider the recommendations under subclause (I) when determining the appropriate pricing methodology to determine the expected market price for grain sorghum under both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance.

                    (III) __Publication__ 

                        Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Corporation receives the recommendations of the expert reviewers, the Corporation shall publish the proposed pricing methodology for both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance for notice and comment and, during the comment period, conduct at least 1 public meeting to discuss the proposed pricing methodologies.

                        Not later than 180 days after the close of the comment period in clause (iii)(III), but effective not later than the 2010 crop year, the Corporation shall implement a pricing methodology for grain sorghum under the production and revenue-based plans of insurance that is transparent and replicable.

                    (II) __Interim methodology__ 

                        Until the date on which the new pricing methodology is implemented, the Corporation may continue to use the pricing methodology that the Corporation determines best establishes the expected market price.

                    (III) __Availability__ 

                        On an annual basis, the Corporation shall make available the pricing methodology and data used to determine the expected market prices for grain sorghum under the production and revenue-based plans of insurance, including any changes to the methodology used to determine the expected market prices for grain sorghum from the previous year.

        (6) __Price elections__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), insurance coverage shall be made available to a producer on the basis of any price election that equals or is less than the price election established by the Corporation. The coverage shall be quoted in terms of dollars per acre.

            (B) __Minimum price elections__ 

                The Corporation may establish minimum price elections below which levels of insurance shall not be offered.

            (C) __Wheat classes and malting barley__ 

                The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer producers different price elections for classes of wheat and malting barley (including contract prices in the case of malting barley), in addition to the standard price election, that reflect different market prices, as determined by the Corporation. The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer additional coverage for each class determined under this subparagraph and charge a premium for each class that is actuarially sound.

        (7) __Fire and hail coverage__ 

            For levels of additional coverage equal to 65 percent or more of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, a producer may elect to delete from the additional coverage any coverage against damage caused by fire and hail if the producer obtains an equivalent or greater dollar amount of coverage for damage caused by fire and hail from an approved insurance provider. On written notice of the election to the company issuing the policy providing additional coverage and submission of evidence of substitute coverage on the commodity insured, the premium of the producer shall be reduced by an amount determined by the Corporation to be actuarially appropriate, taking into account the actuarial value of the remaining coverage provided by the Corporation. In no event shall the producer be given credit for an amount of premium determined to be greater than the actuarial value of the protection against losses caused by fire and hail that is included in the additional coverage for the crop.

        (8) __State premium subsidies__ 

            The Corporation may enter into an agreement with any State or agency of a State under which the State or agency may pay to the approved insurance provider an additional premium subsidy to further reduce the portion of the premium paid by producers in the State.

        (9) __Limitations on additional coverage__ 

            The Board may limit the availability of additional coverage under this subsection in any county or area, or on any farm, on the basis of the insurance risk involved. The Board shall not offer additional coverage equal to less than 50 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage.

            The reinsurance shall be provided on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine to be consistent with subsections (b) and (c) of this section and sound reinsurance principles.

        (3) __Share of risk__ 

            The reinsurance agreements of the Corporation with the reinsured companies shall require the reinsured companies to bear a sufficient share of any potential loss under the agreement so as to ensure that the reinsured company will sell and service policies of insurance in a sound and prudent manner, taking into consideration the financial condition of the reinsured companies and the availability of private reinsurance.

        (4) __Rate__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the rate established by the Board to reimburse approved insurance providers and agents for the administrative and operating costs of the providers and agents shall not exceed—

                (i) for the 1998 reinsurance year, 27 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio; and

                (ii) for each of the 1999 and subsequent reinsurance years, 24.5 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio.

            (B) __Proportional reductions__ 

                A policy of additional coverage that received a rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs for the 1998 reinsurance year that is lower than the rate specified in subparagraph (A)(i) shall receive a reduction in the rate of reimbursement that is proportional to the reduction in the rate of reimbursement between clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Other reductions__ 

                Beginning with the 2002 reinsurance year, in the case of a policy or plan of insurance approved by the Board that was not reinsured during the 1998 reinsurance year but, had it been reinsured, would have received a reduced rate of reimbursement during the 1998 reinsurance year, the rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs established for the policy or plan of insurance shall take into account the factors used to determine the rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs during the 1998 reinsurance year, including the expected difference in premium and actual administrative and operating costs of the policy or plan of insurance relative to an individual yield policy or plan of insurance and other appropriate factors, as determined by the Corporation.

            (D) __Time for reimbursement__ 

                Effective beginning with the 2012 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall reimburse approved insurance providers and agents for the allowable administrative and operating costs of the providers and agents as soon as practicable after October 1 (but not later than October 31) after the reinsurance year for which reimbursements are earned.

            (E) __Reimbursement rate reduction__ 

                In the case of a policy of additional coverage that received a rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs for the 2008 reinsurance year, for each of the 2009 and subsequent reinsurance years, the reimbursement rate for administrative and operating costs shall be 2.3 percentage points below the rates in effect as of the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 for all crop insurance policies used to define loss ratio, except that only ½ of the reduction shall apply in a reinsurance year to the total premium written in a State in which the State loss ratio is greater than 1.2.

            (F) __Reimbursement rate for area policies and plans of insurance__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (E), for each of the 2009 and subsequent reinsurance years, the reimbursement rate for area policies and plans of insurance widely available as of the date of enactment of this subparagraph shall be 12 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio for that reinsurance year.

        (5) __Cost and regulatory reduction__ 

            Consistent with section 118 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, and consistent with maintenance of program integrity, prevention of fraud and abuse, the need for program expansion, and improvement of quality of service to customers, the Board shall alter program procedures and administrative requirements in order to reduce the administrative and operating costs of approved insurance providers and agents in an amount that corresponds to any reduction in the reimbursement rate required under paragraph (4) during the 5-year period beginning on October 13, 1994.

        (6) __Agency discretion__ 

            The determination of whether the Corporation is achieving, or has achieved, corresponding administrative cost savings shall not be subject to administrative review, and is wholly committed to agency discretion within the meaning of [section 701(a)(2) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s701/a/2].

        (7) __Plan__ 

            The Corporation shall submit to Congress a plan outlining the measures that will be used to achieve the reduction required under paragraph (5). If the Corporation can identify additional cost reduction measures, the Corporation shall describe the measures in the plan.

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), notwithstanding section 536 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 ([7 U.S.C. 1506][/us/usc/t7/s1506] note; [Public Law 105–185][/us/pl/105/185]) and section 148 of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 ([7 U.S.C. 1506][/us/usc/t7/s1506] note; [Public Law 106–224][/us/pl/106/224]), the Corporation may renegotiate the financial terms and conditions of each Standard Reinsurance Agreement—

                (i) to be effective for the 2011 reinsurance year beginning July 1, 2010; and

                (ii) once during each period of 5 reinsurance years thereafter.

            (B) __Exceptions__ 

                (i) __Adverse circumstances__ 

                    Subject to clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall not apply in any case in which the approved insurance providers, as a whole, experience unexpected adverse circumstances, as determined by the Secretary.

                (ii) __Effect of Federal law changes__ 

                    If Federal law is enacted after the date of enactment of this paragraph that requires revisions in the financial terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement, and changes in the Agreement are made on a mandatory basis by the Corporation, the changes shall not be considered to be a renegotiation of the Agreement for purposes of subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Notification requirement__ 

                If the Corporation renegotiates a Standard Reinsurance Agreement under subparagraph (A)(iii), <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Subpar. (A) does not contain a cl. (iii). </sup></sup>  the Corporation shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate of the renegotiation.

                Alternatives considered under clause (i) shall include—

                    (I)

                     methods that—

                        (aa) are graduated and base reimbursement rates in a State on changes in premiums in that State;

                        (bb) are graduated and base reimbursement rates in a State on the loss ratio for crop insurance for that State; and

                        (cc) are graduated and base reimbursement rates on individual policies on the level of total premium for each policy; and

                    (II) any other method that takes into account current financial conditions of the program and ensures continued availability of the program to producers on a nationwide basis.

        (9) __Due date for payment of underwriting gains__ 

        Effective beginning with the 2011 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall make payments for underwriting gains under this subchapter on—

            (A) for the 2011 reinsurance year, October 1, 2012; and

            (B) for each reinsurance year thereafter, October 1 of the following calendar year.

    (l) __Optional coverages__ 

        The Corporation may offer specific risk protection programs, including protection against prevented planting, wildlife depredation, tree damage and disease, and insect infestation, under such terms and conditions as the Board may determine, except that no program may be undertaken if insurance for the specific risk involved is generally available from private companies.

    (m) __Quality loss adjustment coverage__ 

        (1) __Effect of coverage__ 

            If a policy or plan of insurance offered under this subchapter includes quality loss adjustment coverage, the coverage shall provide for a reduction in the quantity of production of the agricultural commodity considered produced during a crop year, or a similar adjustment, as a result of the agricultural commodity not meeting the quality standards established in the policy or plan of insurance.

        (2) __Additional quality loss adjustment__ 

            (A) __Producer option__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to the quality loss adjustment coverage available under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall offer producers the option of purchasing quality loss adjustment coverage on a basis that is smaller than a unit with respect to an agricultural commodity that satisfies each of the following:

                (i) The agricultural commodity is sold on an identity-preserved basis.

                (ii) All quality determinations are made solely by the Federal agency designated to grade or classify the agricultural commodity.

                (iii) All quality determinations are made in accordance with standards published by the Federal agency in the Federal Register.

                (iv) The discount schedules that reflect the reduction in quality of the agricultural commodity are established by the Secretary.

            (B) __Basis for adjustment__ 

                Under this paragraph, the Corporation shall set the quality standards below which quality losses will be paid based on the variability of the grade of the agricultural commodity from the base quality for the agricultural commodity.

        (3) __Review of criteria and procedures__ 

            (A) __Review__ 

                The Corporation shall contract with a qualified person to review the quality loss adjustment procedures of the Corporation so that the procedures more accurately reflect local quality discounts that are applied to agricultural commodities insured under this subchapter.

            (B) __Procedures__ 

                Effective beginning not later than the 2004 reinsurance year, based on the review, the Corporation shall make adjustments in the procedures, taking into consideration the actuarial soundness of the adjustment and the prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse.

        (4) __Quality of agricultural commodities delivered to warehouse operators__ 

        In administering this subchapter, the Secretary shall accept, in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions, evidence of the quality of agricultural commodities delivered to—

            (A) warehouse operators that are licensed under the United States Warehouse Act ([7 U.S.C. 241][/us/usc/t7/s241] et seq.);

    (n) __Limitation on multiple benefits for same loss__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a producer who is eligible to receive benefits under catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) of this section is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program administered by the Secretary, the producer shall be required to elect whether to receive benefits under this subchapter or under the other program, but not both. A producer who purchases additional coverage under subsection (c) of this section may also receive assistance for the same loss under other programs administered by the Secretary, except that the amount received for the loss under the additional coverage together with the amount received under the other programs may not exceed the amount of the actual loss of the producer.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to emergency loans under subtitle C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act ([7 U.S.C. 1961][/us/usc/t7/s1961] et seq.).

    (o) __Crop production on native sod__ 

        (1) __Definition of native sod__ 

        In this subsection, the term “native sod” means land—

            (A) on which the plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing; and

                (i) this subchapter; and

                (ii) [section 7333 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7333].
