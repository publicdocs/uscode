## § 1508a. Double insurance and prevented planting

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __First crop__ 

            The term “first crop” means the first crop of the first agricultural commodity planted for harvest, or prevented from being planted, on specific acreage during a crop year and insured under this subchapter.

        (2) __Second crop__ 

            The term “second crop” means a second crop of the same agricultural commodity as the first crop, or a crop of a different agricultural commodity following the first crop, planted on the same acreage as the first crop for harvest in the same crop year, except the term does not include a replanted crop.

        (3) __Replanted crop__ 

            The term “replanted crop” means any agricultural commodity replanted on the same acreage as the first crop for harvest in the same crop year if the replanting is required by the terms of the policy of insurance covering the first crop.

    (b) __Double insurance__ 

        (1) __Options on loss to first crop__ 

        Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e), if a first crop insured under this subchapter in a crop year has a total or partial insurable loss, the producer of the first crop may elect one of the following options:

            (A) __No second crop planted__ 

            The producer may—

                (i) elect to not plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

                (ii) collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop.

            (B) __Second crop planted__ 

            The producer may—

                (i) plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

                (ii) collect an indemnity payment established by the Corporation for the first crop, but not to exceed 35 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop.

        (2) __Effect of no loss to second crop__ 

        If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer may collect an indemnity payment for the first crop that is equal to—

            (A) 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop; less

            (B) the amount previously collected under paragraph (1)(B)(ii).

        (3) __Premium for first crop if second crop planted__ 

            (A) __Initial premium__ 

                If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii). The Corporation shall adjust the total premium for the first crop to reflect the reduced indemnity.

            (B) __Effect of no loss to second crop__ 

            If the producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is equal to—

                (i) the full premium owed by the producer for the first crop; less

                (ii) the amount of premium previously paid under subparagraph (A).

    (c) __Prevented planting coverage__ 

        (1) __Options on loss to first crop__ 

        Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e), if a first crop insured under this subchapter in a crop year is prevented from being planted, the producer of the first crop may elect one of the following options:

            (A) __No second crop planted__ 

            The producer may—

                (i) elect to not plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

                (ii) subject to paragraph (4), collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the prevented planting guarantee for the acreage for the first crop.

            (B) __Second crop planted__ 

            The producer may—

                (i) plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

                (ii) subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), collect an indemnity payment established by the Corporation for the first crop, but not to exceed 35 percent of the prevented planting guarantee for the acreage for the first crop.

        (2) __Premium for first crop if second planted__ 

            If the producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall pay a premium for the first crop that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii). The Corporation shall adjust the total premium for the first crop to reflect the reduced indemnity.

        (3) __Effect on actual production history__ 

            Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d), if a producer make an election under paragraph (1)(B) for a crop year, the Corporation shall assign the producer a recorded yield for that crop year for the first crop equal to 60 percent of the producer’s actual production history for the agricultural commodity involved, for purposes of determining the producer’s actual production history for subsequent crop years.

        (4) __Area conditions required for payment__ 

            The Corporation shall limit prevented planting payments for producers to those situations in which other producers, in the area where a first crop is prevented from being planted is located, are also generally affected by the conditions that prevented the first crop from being planted.

        (5) __Planting date__ 

            If a producer plants the second crop before the latest planting date established by the Corporation for the first crop, the Corporation shall not make a prevented planting payment with regard to the first crop.

    (d) __Exception for established double cropping practices__ 

    A producer may receive full indemnity payments on two or more crops planted for harvest in the same crop year and insured under this subchapter if each of the following conditions are met:

        (1) There is an established practice of planting two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year in the area, as determined by the Corporation.

        (2) An additional coverage policy or plan of insurance is offered with respect to the agricultural commodities planted on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year in the area.

        (3) The producer has a history of planting two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year or the applicable acreage has historically had two or more crops planted for harvest in the same crop year.

        (4) The second or more crops are customarily planted after the first crop for harvest on the same acreage in the same year in the area.

    (e) __Subsequent crops__ 

        Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d), if a producer elects to plant a crop (other than a replanted crop) subsequent to a second crop on the same acreage as the first crop and second crop for harvest in the same crop year, the producer shall not be eligible for insurance under this subchapter, or noninsured crop assistance under [section 7333 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7333], for the subsequent crop.
