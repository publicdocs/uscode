                An applicant who submits a policy under [section 1508(h) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1508/h] shall be eligible for the reimbursement of reasonable research and development costs directly related to the policy if the policy is approved by the Board for sale to producers.

        (2) __Advance payments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board may approve the request of an applicant for advance payment of a portion of reasonable research and development costs prior to submission and approval of the policy by the Board under [section 1508(h) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1508/h].

            (B) __Procedures__ 

                The Board shall establish procedures for approving advance payment of reasonable research and development costs to applicants.
