    (b) __Payment threshold__ 

        A participating dairy operation shall receive a margin protection payment whenever the average actual dairy production margin for a consecutive 2-month period is less than the coverage level threshold selected by the participating dairy operation.

    (c) __Amount of margin protection payment__ 

    The margin protection payment for the participating dairy operation shall be determined as follows:

            (A) the coverage percentage selected by the participating dairy operation; and

            (B) the production history of the participating dairy operation divided by 6.
