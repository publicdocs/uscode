    (c) __Effect of failure to make unanimous election__ 

    If all the producers on a farm fail to make a unanimous election under subsection (a) for the 2014 crop year—

        (1) the Secretary shall not make any payments with respect to the farm for the 2014 crop year under section 9016 or 9017 of this title; and

        (2) the producers on the farm shall be deemed to have elected price loss coverage under [section 9016 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s9016] for all covered commodities on the farm for the 2015 through 2018 crop years.

    (d) __Effect of selection of county coverage__

    (e) __Effect of selection of individual coverage__ 

    If all the producers on a farm select individual coverage under subsection (b)(2), in addition to the selection and election under this section applying to each producer on the farm, the Secretary shall consider, for purposes of making the calculations required by subsections (b)(2) and (c)(3) of [section 9017 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s9017], the producer’s share of all farms in the same State—

        (1) in which the producer has an interest; and

        (2) for which individual coverage has been selected.

    (f) __Prohibition on reconstitution__ 

        The Secretary shall ensure that producers on a farm do not reconstitute the farm to void or change an election or selection made under this section.
