## § 9016. Price loss coverage

    (a) __Price loss coverage payments__ 

    If all of the producers on a farm make the election under subsection (a) of [section 9015 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s9015] to obtain price loss coverage or, subject to subsection (c)(1) of such section, are deemed to have made such election under subsection (c)(2) of such section, the Secretary shall make price loss coverage payments to producers on the farm on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis if the Secretary determines that, for any of the 2014 through 2018 crop years—

        (1) the effective price for the covered commodity for the crop year; is less than

        (2) the reference price for the covered commodity for the crop year.

    (b) __Effective price__ 

    The effective price for a covered commodity for a crop year shall be the higher of—

        (1) the national average market price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary; or

        (2) the national average loan rate for a marketing assistance loan for the covered commodity in effect for such crop year under subchapter II.

    (c) __Payment rate__ 

    The payment rate shall be equal to the difference between—

        (1) the reference price for the covered commodity; and

        (2) the effective price determined under subsection (b) for the covered commodity.

    (d) __Payment amount__ 

    If price loss coverage payments are required to be provided under this section for any of the 2014 through 2018 crop years for a covered commodity, the amount of the price loss coverage payment to be paid to the producers on a farm for the crop year shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

        (1) the payment rate for the covered commodity under subsection (c);

        (2) the payment yield for the covered commodity; and

        (3) the payment acres for the covered commodity.

    (e) __Time for payments__ 

        If the Secretary determines under this section that price loss coverage payments are required to be provided for the covered commodity, the payments shall be made beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the covered commodity.

    (f) __Effective price for barley__ 

        In determining the effective price for barley under subsection (b), the Secretary shall use the all-barley price.
