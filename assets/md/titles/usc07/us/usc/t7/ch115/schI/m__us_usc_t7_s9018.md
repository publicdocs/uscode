## § 9018. Producer agreements

    (a) __Compliance with certain requirements__ 

        (1) __Requirements__ 

        Before the producers on a farm may receive payments under this subchapter with respect to the farm, the producers shall agree, during the crop year for which the payments are made and in exchange for the payments—

            (A) to comply with applicable conservation requirements under subtitle B of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 ([16 U.S.C. 3811][/us/usc/t16/s3811] et seq.);

            (B) to comply with applicable wetland protection requirements under subtitle C of title XII of that Act ([16 U.S.C. 3821][/us/usc/t16/s3821] et seq.);

            (C) to effectively control noxious weeds and otherwise maintain the land in accordance with sound agricultural practices, as determined by the Secretary; and

            (D) to use the land on the farm, in a quantity equal to the attributable base acres for the farm and any base acres for an agricultural or conserving use, and not for a nonagricultural commercial, industrial, or residential use, as determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Compliance__ 

            The Secretary may issue such rules as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure producer compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1).

        (3) __Modification__ 

            At the request of the transferee or owner, the Secretary may modify the requirements of this subsection if the modifications are consistent with the objectives of this subsection, as determined by the Secretary.

    (b) __Transfer or change of interest in farm__ 

        (1) __Termination__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in paragraph (2), a transfer of (or change in) the interest of the producers on a farm for which payments under this subchapter are provided shall result in the termination of the payments, unless the transferee or owner of the acreage agrees to assume all obligations under subsection (a).

            (B) __Effective date__ 

                The termination shall take effect on the date determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            If a producer entitled to a payment under this subchapter dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, the Secretary shall make the payment in accordance with rules issued by the Secretary.

    (c) __Acreage reports__ 

        As a condition on the receipt of any benefits under this subchapter or subchapter II, the Secretary shall require producers on a farm to submit to the Secretary annual acreage reports with respect to all cropland on the farm.

    (d) __Production reports__ 

    As an additional condition on receiving agriculture risk coverage payments for individual coverage, the Secretary shall require a producer on a farm to submit to the Secretary annual production reports with respect to all covered commodities produced on all farms in the same State—

        (1) in which the producer has an interest; and

        (2) for which individual coverage has been selected.

    (e) __Effect of inaccurate reports__ 

        No penalty with respect to benefits under this subchapter or subchapter II shall be assessed against a producer on a farm for an inaccurate acreage or production report unless the Secretary determines that the producer on the farm knowingly and willfully falsified the acreage or production report.

    (f) __Tenants and sharecroppers__ 

        In carrying out this subchapter, the Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers.

    (g) __Sharing of payments__ 

        The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of payments made under this subchapter among the producers on a farm on a fair and equitable basis.
