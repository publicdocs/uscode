## § 9019. Transition assistance for producers of upland cotton

    (a) __Availability__ 

        (1) __Purpose__ 

            It is the purpose of this section to provide transition assistance to producers of upland cotton in light of the repeal of [section 8713 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s8713], the inapplicability of sections 9016 and 9017 of this title to upland cotton, and the delayed implementation of the Stacked Income Protection Plan required by [section 1508b of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1508b], as added by section 11017 of this Act.

        (2) __2014 crop year__ 

            For the 2014 crop of upland cotton, the Secretary shall provide transition assistance, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section, to producers on a farm for which cotton base acres were in existence for the 2013 crop year.

        (3) __2015 crop year__ 

        For the 2015 crop of upland cotton, the Secretary shall provide transition assistance, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section, to producers on a farm—

            (A) for which cotton base acres were in existence for the 2013 crop year; and

            (B) that is located in a county in which the Stacked Income Protection Plan required by [section 1508b of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1508b] is not available to producers of upland cotton for the 2015 crop year.

    (b) __Transition assistance rate__ 

    The transition assistance rate shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

        (1) the June 12, 2013, midpoint estimate for the marketing year average price of upland cotton received by producers for the marketing year beginning August 1, 2013, minus the December 10, 2013, midpoint estimate for the marketing year average price of upland cotton received by producers for the marketing year beginning August 1, 2013, as contained in the applicable World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report published by the Department of Agriculture; and

        (2) the national program yield for upland cotton of 597 pounds per acre.

    (c) __Calculation of transition assistance amount__ 

    The amount of transition assistance to be provided under this section to producers on a farm for a crop year shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

        (1) for the 2014 crop year, 60 percent, and for the 2015 crop year, 36.5 percent, of the cotton base acres referred to in subsection (a) for the farm, subject to adjustment or reduction for conservation measures as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of [section 9012 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s9012];

        (2) the transition assistance rate in effect for the crop year under subsection (b); and

        (3) the payment yield for upland cotton for the farm established for purposes of [section 8713(c)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s8713/c/3], divided by the national program yield for upland cotton of 597 pounds per acre.

    (d) __Time for payment__ 

        The Secretary may not make transition assistance payments for a crop year under this section before October 1 of the calendar year in which the crop of upland cotton is harvested.

    (e) __Payment limitations__ 

        Sections 1308 through 1308–3 of this title, as in effect on September 30, 2013, shall apply to the receipt of transition assistance under this section in the same manner as such sections applied to [section 8713 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s8713].
