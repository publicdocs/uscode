## § 9055. Production history of participating dairy operations

    (a) __Production history__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subsection (b), when a dairy operation first registers to participate in the margin protection program, the production history of the dairy operation for the margin protection program is equal to the highest annual milk marketings of the participating dairy operation during any one of the 2011, 2012, or 2013 calendar years.

        (2) __Adjustment__ 

            In subsequent years, the Secretary shall adjust the production history of a participating dairy operation determined under paragraph (1) to reflect any increase in the national average milk production.

    (b) __Election by new dairy operations__ 

    In the case of a participating dairy operation that has been in operation for less than a year, the participating dairy operation shall elect 1 of the following methods for the Secretary to determine the production history of the participating dairy operation:

        (1) The volume of the actual milk marketings for the months the participating dairy operation has been in operation extrapolated to a yearly amount.

        (2) An estimate of the actual milk marketings of the participating dairy operation based on the herd size of the participating dairy operation relative to the national rolling herd average data published by the Secretary.

    (c) __Required information__ 

        A participating dairy operation shall provide all information that the Secretary may require in order to establish the production history of the participating dairy operation for purposes of participating in the margin protection program.
