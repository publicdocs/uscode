## § 8. Application for designation as contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility; time; suspension or revocation of designation; hearing; review by court of appeals

    (a) Any person desiring to be designated or registered as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility shall make application to the Commission for the designation or registration and accompany the same with a showing that it complies with the conditions set forth in this chapter, and with a sufficient assurance that it will continue to comply with the the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  requirements of this chapter. The Commission shall approve or deny an application for designation or registration as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility within 180 days of the filing of the application. If the Commission notifies the person that its application is materially incomplete and specifies the deficiencies in the application, the running of the 180-day period shall be stayed from the time of such notification until the application is resubmitted in completed form: Provided, That the Commission shall have not less than sixty days to approve or deny the application from the time the application is resubmitted in completed form. If the Commission denies an application, it shall specify the grounds for the denial. In the event of a refusal to designate or register as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility any person that has made application therefor, the person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Commission, with the right to appeal an adverse decision after such hearing to the court of appeals as provided for in other cases in subsection (b) of this section.

    (b) The Commission is authorized to suspend for a period not to exceed 6 months or to revoke the designation or registration of any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility on a showing that the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility is not enforcing or has not enforced its rules of government, made a condition of its designation or registration as set forth in sections 7 through 7a–1 of this title or [section 7b–1 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7b–1], or that the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility or electronic trading facility, or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof, otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission thereunder. Such suspension or revocation shall only be made after a notice to the officers of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility or electronic trading facility affected and upon a hearing on the record: Provided, That such suspension or revocation shall be final and conclusive, unless within fifteen days after such suspension or revocation by the Commission such person appeals to the court of appeals for the circuit in which it has its principal place of business, by filing with the clerk of such court a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such person will pay the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs. The clerk of the court in which such a petition is filed shall immediately cause a copy thereof to be delivered to the Commission and file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112]. The testimony and evidence taken or submitted before the Commission, duly filed as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by the court of appeals as the evidence in the case. Such a court may affirm or set aside the order of the Commission or may direct it to modify its order. No such order of the Commission shall be modified or set aside by the court of appeals unless it is shown by the person that the order is unsupported by the weight of the evidence or was issued without due notice and a reasonable opportunity having been afforded to such person for a hearing, or infringes the Constitution of the United States, or is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission.

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–546, § 209(a)(1)][/us/pl/102/546/s209/a/1], (2), designated first par. as subsec. (a) and redesignated former par. (a) as subsec. (b).

    Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 102–546, § 209(a)(3)][/us/pl/102/546/s209/a/3], substituted “subsection (b)” for “paragraph (a)”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 102–546, § 402(9)(A)][/us/pl/102/546/s402/9/A], which directed amendment of first sentence by striking “the Secretary of Agriculture or”, could not be executed because of amendment by [Pub. L. 93–463, § 103(a)][/us/pl/93/463/s103/a]. See 1974 Amendment note below.

    [Pub. L. 102–546, § 402(1)(B)][/us/pl/102/546/s402/1/B], substituted “Commission” for “commission” wherever appearing.

    1984—Par. (a). [Pub. L. 98–620][/us/pl/98/620] struck out provisions requiring proceedings in such cases in the court of appeals to be made a preferred cause and expedited in every way.

    1983—[Pub. L. 97–444][/us/pl/97/444] required approval or denial of application within one year period of filing of application, stay of such period following notification that application was incomplete and deficient until resubmission of application, minimum period prior to acting upon resubmitted application, and specification of grounds for denial of application.

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–405, § 13(1)][/us/pl/95/405/s13/1], in provisions before par. (a) inserted “on the record” after “opportunity for a hearing”.

    Par. (a). [Pub. L. 95–405, § 13(2)][/us/pl/95/405/s13/2], inserted “on the record” after “upon a hearing”.

    1974—[Pub. L. 93–463, § 103(a)][/us/pl/93/463/s103/a], substituted “Commission” for “Secretary of Agriculture” in first par.

    Par. (a). [Pub. L. 93–463, § 103(c)][/us/pl/93/463/s103/c], struck out “the Secretary of Agriculture, who shall thereupon notify the other members of” after “The clerk of the court in which such a petition is filed shall immediately cause a copy thereof to be delivered to”.

    [Pub. L. 93–463, § 103(a)][/us/pl/93/463/s103/a], provided for substitution of “Commission” for “Secretary of Agriculture” except where such words would be stricken by section 103(b), which directed striking the words “the Secretary of Agriculture or” where they appeared in the phrase “the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission”. Because the word “commission” was not capitalized in that phrase in par. (a), section 103(b) did not apply to par. (a) and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of “the Commission or the commission” for “the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission”.

    1968—[Pub. L. 90–258, § 14][/us/pl/90/258/s14], inserted provision affording any board of trade refused a contract market designation a hearing before the Commission with right to appeal in adverse decision to the court of appeals as provided for in par.

    Par. (a). [Pub. L. 90–258, § 15][/us/pl/90/258/s15], amended par. (a) generally, striking out such parts both of first sentence and of proviso of last sentence as described the commission as made up of the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, and Attorney General (covered in definition of “Commission” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2], including representation of such officials by their designees), extending grounds for suspension or revocation of designation to include violations of any provisions of this chapter or rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Agriculture or commission, requiring delivery of appeal petitions to Secretary of Agriculture rather than any member of the commission, who would notify the other members, and filing of commission records of proceedings on appeal by the Secretary of Agriculture and not the commission, striking out provisions describing Secretary of Agriculture as Chairman (now found in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2]), superseding such part of proviso of seventh sentence as authorized appeals to the commission from Secretary of Agriculture’s refusal of a contract market designation by provisions of first par. of this section, and striking out such other part as made decision of court on appeal from commission final and binding on the parties.

    1958—[Pub. L. 85–791][/us/pl/85/791] substituted “thereupon file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112]” for “forthwith prepare, certify, and file in the court a full and accurate transcript of the record in such proceedings including the notice to the board of trade, a copy of the charges, the evidence, and the report and order” in third notice, and struck out “certified and” after “duly” in fourth sentence.

 __Change of Name__ 

    Act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted “court of appeals” for “circuit court of appeals” wherever appearing in this section.
