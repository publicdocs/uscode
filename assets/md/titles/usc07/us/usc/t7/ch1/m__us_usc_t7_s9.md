    (1) __Prohibition against manipulation__ 

    It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate by not later than 1 year after July 21, 2010, provided no rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission shall require any person to disclose to another person nonpublic information that may be material to the market price, rate, or level of the commodity transaction, except as necessary to make any statement made to the other person in or in connection with the transaction not misleading in any material respect.

        (A) __Special provision for manipulation by false reporting__ 

            Unlawful manipulation for purposes of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, delivering, or causing to be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce, by any means of communication whatsoever, a false or misleading or inaccurate report concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, knowing, or acting in reckless disregard of the fact that such report is false, misleading or inaccurate.

            Mistakenly transmitting, in good faith, false or misleading or inaccurate information to a price reporting service would not be sufficient to violate paragraph (1)(A).

    (2) __Prohibition regarding false information__ 

        It shall be unlawful for any person to make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the Commission, including in any registration application or any report filed with the Commission under this chapter, or any other information relating to a swap, or a contract of sale of a commodity, in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, or to omit to state in any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any statement of a material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.

    (3) __Other manipulation__ 

        In addition to the prohibition in paragraph (1), it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.

    (4) __Enforcement__

    [Pub. L. 111–203][/us/pl/111/203], § 741(b)(3), in first sentence, inserted “or of any swap,” before “or has willfully made”.

    2008—[Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246], § 13103(a), in cl. (3) of third sentence inserted “(A)” after “assess such person” and added subcl. (B).

    2000—[Pub. L. 106–554][/us/pl/106/554] substituted “registered entity” for “contract market” wherever appearing, “registered entities” for “contract markets” wherever appearing, and “privileges” for “trading privileges” in two places.

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–546][/us/pl/102/546], § 402(9)(B), which directed amendment of first sentence by striking “the Secretary of Agriculture or”, could not be executed because of amendment by [Pub. L. 93–463][/us/pl/93/463], § 103(a). See 1974 Amendment note below.

    [Pub. L. 102–546][/us/pl/102/546], §§ 209(a)(1), 212(b), 223, 402(1)(C), (6), substituted, in first sentence, “Commission thereunder” for “commission thereunder”, in sentence beginning “Upon evidence received”, inserted “(1)”, substituted “(2) if” for “and, if”, “suspend” for “may suspend”, “(3)” for “and may”, “the higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to such person” for “$100,000”, and inserted before period “and (4) require restitution to customers of damages proximately caused by violations of such persons”, and in sentence beginning “After the issuance”, substituted “offending person” for “offending person.”.

    1983—[Pub. L. 97–444][/us/pl/97/444] struck out “as futures commission merchant or any person associated therewith as described in [section 6k of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6k], commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, or as floor broker hereunder” after “such person, if registered” and also after “such person is registered” and inserted “, or in the case of an order denying registration, the circuit in which the petitioner’s principal place of business listed on petitioner’s application for registration is located,” after “court of appeals of the circuit in which the petitioner is doing business”.

    1974—[Pub. L. 93–463][/us/pl/93/463], §§ 103(e), 204(b), 205(b), 212(a)(1), (2), 408, substituted “it” for “he”, inserted “or any person associated therewith as described in [section 6k of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6k],” after “futures commission merchant” wherever appearing, inserted “commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator” before “or as floor broker” wherever appearing, inserted provision for the assessment of civil penalties of not more than $100,000 for each violation, set a limit of fifteen days after the issuance of an order within which period the person against whom the order was issued must file with the court of appeals his petition that the order be set aside, and substituted “an Administrative Law Judge” and “Administrative Law Judge” for “a referee” and “referee”, respectively.

    [Pub. L. 93–463][/us/pl/93/463], § 103(a), provided for substitution of “Commission” for “Secretary of Agriculture” except where such words would be stricken by section 103(b), which directed striking the words “the Secretary of Agriculture or” where they appeared in the phrase “the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission”. Section 103(a) was executed wherever the term “Secretary of Agriculture” appeared in this section including in the phrase “the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission” in the first sentence. Because the word “commission” was not capitalized in that phrase in the first sentence, section 103(b) did not apply to that phrase and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of “the Commission or the commission” for “the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission”.

    1968—[Pub. L. 90–258][/us/pl/90/258] amended first sentence generally, providing for denial of trading privileges to persons other than contract markets and suspension or revocation of registration of futures commission merchants and floor brokers, who are manipulating or have attempted to manipulate prices, for willful, material, misstatements in, or omissions from, reports or registration statements, and for violations of orders of Secretary of Agriculture or commission, and authorizing the Secretary to prohibit such persons from trading on or subject to rules of any contract market.

    1960—[Pub. L. 86–507][/us/pl/86/507] inserted “or by certified mail” after “registered mail”.

    1958—[Pub. L. 85–791][/us/pl/85/791] substituted “transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Agriculture and thereupon the Secretary of Agriculture shall file in the court the record theretofore made, as provided in [section 2112 of Title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112]” for “served upon the Secretary of Agriculture by delivering such copy to him and thereupon the Secretary of Agriculture shall forthwith certify and file in the court a transcript of the record theretofore made, including evidence received” in seventh sentence, and substituted “petition” for “transcript” in eighth sentence.

    1936—Act June 15, 1936, among other changes, amended section by inserting provisions relating to the service of complaints and penalties for violations of this chapter.
