        (1) __Cotton futures contract__ 

            The term “cotton futures contract” means any contract of sale of cotton for future delivery made at, on, or in any exchange, board of trade, or similar institution or place of business which has been designated a “contract market” by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act \[[7 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t7/s1] et seq.\] and the term “contract of sale” as so used shall be held to include sales, agreements of sale, and agreements to sell, except that any cotton futures contract that, by its terms, is settled in cash is excluded from the coverage of this paragraph and section.

        (2) __Future delivery__ 

            The term “future delivery” shall not include any cash sale of cotton for deferred shipment or delivery.

        (3) __Person__ 

            The term “person” includes an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.

        (4) __Secretary__ 

            The term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States.

            The term “standards” means the official cotton standards of the United States established by the Secretary pursuant to the United States Cotton Standards Act, as amended \[[7 U.S.C. 51][/us/usc/t7/s51] et seq.\].

    (d) __Bona fide spot markets and commercial differences__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            For purposes of this section, the only markets which shall be considered bona fide spot markets shall be those which the Secretary shall, from time to time, after investigation, determine and designate to be such, and of which he shall give public notice.

        (2) __Determination__ 

            In determining, pursuant to the provisions of this section, what markets are bona fide spot markets, the Secretary is directed to consider only markets in which spot cotton is sold in such volume and under such conditions as customarily to reflect accurately the value of middling cotton and the differences between the prices or values of middling cotton and of other grades of cotton for which standards shall have been established by the Secretary; except that if there are not sufficient places, in the markets of which are made bona fide sales of spot cotton of grades for which standards are established by the Secretary, to enable him to designate at least five spot markets in accordance with subsection (f)(3), he shall, from data as to spot sales collected by him, make rules and regulations for determining the actual commercial differences in the value of spot cotton of the grades established by him as reflected by bona fide sales of spot cotton, of the same or different grades, in the market selected and designated by him, from time to time, for that purpose, and in that event differences in value of cotton of various grades involved in contracts made pursuant to subsection (f)(1) and (2) shall be determined in compliance with such rules and regulations. It shall be the duty of any person engaged in the business of dealing in cotton, when requested by the Secretary or any agent acting under his instructions, to answer correctly to the best of his knowledge, under oath or otherwise, all questions touching his knowledge of the number of bales, the classification, the price or bona fide price offered, and other terms of purchase or sale, of any cotton involved in any transaction participated in by him, or to produce all books, letters, papers, or documents in his possession or under his control relating to such matter. A person complying with the preceding sentence shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising or resulting from such compliance.

        (3) __Withholding information__ 

            Any person engaged in the business of dealing in cotton who shall, within a reasonable time prescribed by the Secretary or any agent acting under his instructions, willfully fail or refuse to answer questions or to produce books, letters, papers, or documents, as required under paragraph (2) of this subsection, or who shall willfully give any answer that is false or misleading, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.

For purposes of this paragraph, such values in the such spot markets shall be based upon the standards for grades of cotton established by the Secretary. Whenever the value of one grade is to be determined from the sale or sales of spot cotton of another grade or grades, such value shall be fixed in accordance with rules and regulations which shall be prescribed for the purpose by the Secretary.
