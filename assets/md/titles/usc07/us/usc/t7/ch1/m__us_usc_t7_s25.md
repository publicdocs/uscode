## § 25. Private rights of action

    (a) __Actual damages; actionable transactions; exclusive remedy__ 

        (1)

         Any person (other than a registered entity or registered futures association) who violates this chapter or who willfully aids, abets, counsels, induces, or procures the commission of a violation of this chapter shall be liable for actual damages resulting from one or more of the transactions referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of this paragraph and caused by such violation to any other person—

            (A) who received trading advice from such person for a fee;

            (B) who made through such person any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery (or option on such contract or any commodity) or any swap; or who deposited with or paid to such person money, securities, or property (or incurred debt in lieu thereof) in connection with any order to make such contract or any swap;

            (C)

             who purchased from or sold to such person or placed through such person an order for the purchase or sale of—

                (i) an option subject to [section 6c of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6c] (other than an option purchased or sold on a registered entity or other board of trade);

                (ii) a contract subject to [section 23 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s23]; or  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The word “or” probably should not appear. </sup></sup> 

                (iii) an interest or participation in a commodity pool; or

                (iv) a swap; or

            (D)

             who purchased or sold a contract referred to in subparagraph (B) hereof or swap if the violation constitutes—

                (i) the use or employment of, or an attempt to use or employ, in connection with a swap, or a contract of sale of a commodity, in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate by not later than 1 year after July 21, 2010; or

                (ii) a manipulation of the price of any such contract or swap or the price of the commodity underlying such contract or swap.

        (2) Except as provided in subsection (b), the rights of action authorized by this subsection and by sections 7(d)(13), 7a–1(c)(2)(H), and 21(b)(10) of this title shall be the exclusive remedies under this chapter available to any person who sustains loss as a result of any alleged violation of this chapter. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or abridge the rights of the parties to agree in advance of a dispute upon any forum for resolving claims under this section, including arbitration.

        (3)

         In any action arising from a violation in the execution of an order on the floor of a registered entity, the person referred to in paragraph (1) shall be liable for—

            (A) actual damages proximately caused by such violation. If an award of actual damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under [section 2(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2/a/1] for the floor broker’s violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award; and

            (B) where the violation is willful and intentional, punitive or exemplary damages equal to no more than two times the amount of such actual damages. If an award of punitive or exemplary damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under [section 2(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2/a/1] for the floor broker’s violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award if the floor broker fails to do so, except that such requirement shall apply to the futures commission merchant only if it willfully and intentionally selected the floor broker with the intent to assist or facilitate the floor broker’s violation.

        (4) __Contract enforcement between eligible counterparties.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            No hybrid instrument sold to any investor shall be void, voidable, or unenforceable, and no party to a hybrid instrument shall be entitled to rescind, or recover any payment made with respect to, the hybrid instrument under this section or any other provision of Federal or State law, based solely on the failure of the hybrid instrument to comply with the terms or conditions of [section 2(f) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2/f] or regulations of the Commission.

            (B)  __Swaps__  __.—__ 

            No agreement, contract, or transaction between eligible contract participants or persons reasonably believed to be eligible contract participants shall be void, voidable, or unenforceable, and no party to such agreement, contract, or transaction shall be entitled to rescind, or recover any payment made with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction under this section or any other provision of Federal or State law, based solely on the failure of the agreement, contract, or transaction—

                (i) to meet the definition of a swap under [section 1a of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1a]; or

                (ii) to be cleared in accordance with [section 2(h)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2/h/1].

        (5) __Legal certainty for long-term swaps entered into before__  __July 21, 2010__  __.—__ 

            (A)  __Effect on swaps__  __.—__ 

            Unless specifically reserved in the applicable swap, neither the enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, nor any requirement under that Act or an amendment made by that Act, shall constitute a termination event, force majeure, illegality, increased costs, regulatory change, or similar event under a swap (including any related credit support arrangement) that would permit a party to terminate, renegotiate, modify, amend, or supplement 1 or more transactions under the swap.

            (B)  __Position limits__  __.—__ 

            Any position limit established under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 shall not apply to a position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of any rule, regulation, or order under the Act that establishes the position limit; provided, however, that such positions shall be attributed to the trader if the trader’s position is increased after the effective date of such position limit rule, regulation, or order.

        (6)  __Contract enforcement for foreign futures contracts__  __.—__ 

        A contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery traded or executed on or through the facilities of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States for purposes of [section 6(a) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s6/a] shall not be void, voidable, or unenforceable, and a party to such a contract shall not be entitled to rescind or recover any payment made with respect to the contract, based on the failure of the foreign board of trade to comply with any provision of this chapter.

    (b) __Liabilities of organizations and individuals; bad faith requirement; exclusive remedy__
