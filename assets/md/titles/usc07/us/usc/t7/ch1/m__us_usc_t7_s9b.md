## § 9b. Rules prohibiting deceptive and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices

    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), not later than six months after the effective date of rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission under [section 6102(a) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s6102/a], the Commission shall promulgate, or require each registered futures association to promulgate, rules substantially similar to such rules to prohibit deceptive and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices by any person registered or exempt from registration under this chapter in connection with such person’s business as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, leverage transaction merchant, floor broker, or floor trader, or a person associated with any such person.

    (2)

     The Commission is not required to promulgate rules under paragraph (1) if it determines that—

        (A) rules adopted by the Commission under this chapter provide protection from deceptive and abusive telemarketing by persons described under paragraph (1) substantially similar to that provided by rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission under [section 6102(a) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s6102/a]; or

        (B) such a rule promulgated by the Commission is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest, or for the protection of customers in the futures and options markets, or would be inconsistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.

        If the Commission determines that an exception described in subparagraph (A) or (B) applies, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register its determination with the reasons for it.
