## § 7b–1. Designation of securities exchanges and associations as contract markets

    (a)

     Any board of trade that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, is a national securities association registered pursuant to section 78o–3(a) of title 15, or is an alternative trading system shall be a designated contract market in security futures products if—

        Such designation shall be effective contemporaneously with the submission of notice, in written or electronic form, to the Commission.
