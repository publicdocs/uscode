## § 301. Land grant aid of colleges

    There is granted to the several States, for the purposes hereinafter mentioned in this subchapter, an amount of public land, to be apportioned to each State a quantity equal to thirty thousand acres for each Senator and Representative in Congress to which the States are respectively entitled by the apportionment under the census of 1860: Provided, That no mineral lands shall be selected or purchased under the provisions of said sections.

 __Codification__ 

    Act July 2, 1862, with the exception of section 7, was not incorporated into the Revised Statutes, probably because the grants made thereby were regarded as executed, and the provisions incidental thereto as temporary. By [act Mar. 3, 1883, ch. 102][/us/act/1883-03-03/ch102], [22 Stat. 484][/us/stat/22/484], however, section 4 of the original act was amended to read as set out under [section 304 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s304].

 __Short Title__ 

    Act July 2, 1862, which is classified to this subchapter, is popularly known as the “Morrill Act” and also as the “First Morrill Act”.
