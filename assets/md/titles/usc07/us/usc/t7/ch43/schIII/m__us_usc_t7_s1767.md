 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 961(d) of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s961/d], referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “section 571(d) of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, as amended” and was repealed by section 2205(l) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, [Pub. L. 96–465, title II][/us/pl/96/465], Oct. 17, 1980, [94 Stat. 2159][/us/stat/94/2159]. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is classified principally to chapter 52 (§ 3901 et seq.) of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse. Section 2401(c) of the 1980 Act ([22 U.S.C. 4172(c)][/us/usc/t22/s4172/c]) provides in part that references in law to provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 shall be deemed to include reference to the corresponding provisions of the 1980 Act. For provisions corresponding to section 571(d) of the 1946 Act, see section 503(b)(2) of the 1980 Act ([22 U.S.C. 3983(b)(2)][/us/usc/t22/s3983/b/2]).

    This Act, referred to in subsec. (c), is [act Aug. 28, 1954, ch. 1041][/us/act/1954-08-28/ch1041], [68 Stat. 897][/us/stat/68/897], as amended, known as the Agricultural Act of 1954. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1741 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1741] and Tables.
