## § 1736p. Trade policy declaration

It is hereby declared to be the agricultural trade policy of the United States to—

    (1) be the premier supplier of agricultural and food products to world markets and expand exports of high value products;

    (2) support the principle of free trade and the promotion of fair trade in agricultural commodities and products;

    (3) cooperate fully in all efforts to negotiate with foreign countries further reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures and trade-distorting subsidies;

    (4) aggressively counter unfair foreign trade practices as a means of encouraging fairer trade;

    (5) remove foreign policy constraints to maximize United States economic interests through agricultural trade; and

    (6) provide for consideration of United States agricultural trade interests in the design of national fiscal and monetary policy that may foster continued strength in the value of the dollar.
