    (a) __Substantial injury__ 

        Local currencies that are made available for use under this chapter may not be used to finance the production for export of agricultural commodities (or products thereof) that would compete in the world market with similar agricultural commodities (or products thereof) produced in the United States, if such competition would cause substantial injury to the United States producers, as determined by the President.

    (b) __Exception for narcotics control__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a), the President may provide assistance under this chapter, including assistance through the use of local currencies generated by the sale of commodities under such chapter, for economic development activities undertaken in an eligible country that is a major illicit drug producing country (as defined in section 2291(i)(2)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be section “2291(e)(2)”. </sup></sup>  of title 22), for the purpose of reducing the dependence of the economy of such country on the production of crops from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived.
