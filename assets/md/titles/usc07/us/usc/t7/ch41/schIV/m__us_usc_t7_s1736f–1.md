            (B) wheat, rice, corn, and sorghum (referred to in this section as “eligible commodities”) acquired in accordance with paragraph (2) to replenish eligible commodities released from the trust, including wheat to replenish wheat released from the reserve established under the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 but not replenished as of April 4, 1996;

            (C) such rice, corn, and sorghum as the Secretary may, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, acquire as a result of exchanging an equivalent value of wheat in the trust established under this section; and

             funds made available—

                (i) under paragraph (2)(B);

                (ii) as a result of an exchange of any commodity held in the trust for an equivalent amount of funds from the market, if the Secretary determines that such a sale of the commodity on the market will not unduly disrupt domestic markets; or

        (2) __Replenishment of trust__

            Any funds used to acquire eligible commodities through purchases from producers or in the market to replenish the trust shall be derived—

                Any funds or commodities held in the trust may be released to provide food, and cover any associated costs, under title II of the Food for Peace Act ([7 U.S.C. 1721][/us/usc/t7/s1721] et seq.)—
