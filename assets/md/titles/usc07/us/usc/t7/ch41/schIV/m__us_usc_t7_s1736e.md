## § 1736e. Debt forgiveness

    (a) __Authority__ 

    The President, taking into account the financial resources of a country, may waive payments of principal and interest that such country would otherwise be required to make to the Commodity Credit Corporation under dollar sales agreements under subchapter II if—

        (1) that country is a least developed country; and

        (2)

         either—

            (A) an International Monetary Fund standby agreement is in effect with respect to that country;

            (B) a structural adjustment program of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or of the International Development Association is in effect with respect to that country;

            (C) a structural adjustment facility, enhanced structural adjustment facility, or similar supervised arrangement with the International Monetary Fund is in effect with respect to that country; or

            (D) even though such an agreement, program, facility, or arrangement is not in effect, the country is pursuing national economic policy reforms that would promote democratic, market-oriented, and long term economic development.

    (b) __Request for debt relief by President__ 

    The President may provide debt relief under subsection (a) only if a notification is submitted to Congress at least 10 days prior to providing the debt relief. Such a notification shall—

        (1) specify the amount of official debt the President proposes to liquidate; and

        (2) identify the countries for which debt relief is proposed and the basis for their eligibility for such relief.

    (c) __Appropriations action required__ 

        The aggregate amount of principal and interest waived under this section may not exceed the amount approved for such purpose in an Act appropriating funds to carry out this chapter.

    (d) __Limitation on new credit assistance__ 

        If the authority of this section is used to waive payments otherwise required to be made by a country pursuant to this chapter, the President may not provide any new credit assistance for that country under this chapter during the 2-year period beginning on the date such waiver authority is exercised, unless the President provides to the Congress, before the assistance is provided, a written justification for the provision of such new credit assistance.

    (e) __Applicability__ 

        The authority of this section applies with respect to credit sales agreements entered into before November 28, 1990.

 __Amendments__ 

    1991—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 102–237][/us/pl/102/237], § 326, substituted “subchapter II” for “this subchapter” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 102–237][/us/pl/102/237], § 336, inserted “at least 10 days prior to providing the debt relief” before period at end of first sentence.

    Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 102–237][/us/pl/102/237], § 322, substituted “November 28, 1990” for “the date of enactment of this Act”.

 __Effective Date of 1990 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 101–624][/us/pl/101/624] effective Jan. 1, 1991, see [section 1513 of Pub. L. 101–624][/us/pl/101/624/s1513], set out as a note under [section 1691 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1691].

 __Delegation of Functions__ 

    Functions of President under this section delegated to Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with Food Assistance Policy Council and Department of the Treasury, by section 4(d) of Ex. Ord. No. 12752, Feb. 25, 1991, 56 F.R. 8256, set out as a note under [section 1691 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1691].

 __Renegotiation of Payment Terms of Loans for Sale of Agricultural Commodities__ 

[Pub. L. 102–27, title II][/us/pl/102/27/tII], Apr. 10, 1991, [105 Stat. 147][/us/stat/105/147], as amended by [Pub. L. 110–246, title III][/us/pl/110/246/tIII], § 3001(c), June 18, 2008, [122 Stat. 1821][/us/stat/122/1821], provided that: 

> “Title I of the Public Law 480 \[[7 U.S.C. 1701][/us/usc/t7/s1701] et seq.\] program allowed for the repayment of loans for the sale of agricultural commodities in foreign or local currencies until December 31, 1971. Since that time, until the law was changed in the 1985 farm bill \[probably means [Pub. L. 99–198][/us/pl/99/198], see Tables for classification\], all sales have been on dollar credit terms. In view of the present financial situation, it is impossible for many countries to repay their loans in dollars. Therefore, the President may use the authority in section 411 and section 604 of the Food for Peace Act \[[7 U.S.C. 1736e][/us/usc/t7/s1736e], 1738c\] to renegotiate the payment on Public Law 480 debt in eligible countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.”
