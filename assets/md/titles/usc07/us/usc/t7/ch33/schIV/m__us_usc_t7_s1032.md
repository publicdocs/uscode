For the purpose of making such loans or advances, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such loans or advances to the Secretary of Agriculture. Repayments to the Secretary of Treasury on such loans or advances shall be treated as a public-debt transaction of the United States.
