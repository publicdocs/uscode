## § 7469. Investigations and power to subpoena

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary may make such investigations as the Secretary considers necessary—

        (1) for the effective carrying out of the responsibilities of the Secretary under this subchapter; or

        (2) to determine whether a person subject to this subchapter has engaged or is engaging in any act that constitutes a violation of this subchapter, or any order, rule, or regulation issued under this subchapter.

    (b) __Power to subpoena__ 

        (1) __Investigations__ 

            For the purpose of an investigation made under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations and may issue subpoenas to require the production of any records that are relevant to the inquiry. The production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States.

        (2) __Administrative hearings__ 

            For the purpose of an administrative hearing held under section 7467 or 7468 of this title, the presiding officer is authorized to administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel the attendance of witnesses, take evidence, and require the production of any records that are relevant to the inquiry.

    (c) __Aid of courts__ 

        In the case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena to, any person, the Secretary may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where the person resides or carries on business, to enforce a subpoena issued by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section. The court may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena.

    (d) __Contempt__ 

        Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of the court.
