            The demand for a refund shall be made at such time and in such form as specified by the order.

        (5) __Payment of refund__ 

            A person entitled to a refund shall be paid promptly after the board receives satisfactory proof that the assessment for which the refund is demanded was paid on behalf of the person who makes the demand.

        (6) __Proration__ 

            If the funds in the escrow account required by paragraph (1) are insufficient to pay the amount of all refunds that persons subject to an order otherwise would have a right to receive under this subsection, the board shall prorate the amount of the funds among all the persons.

        (7) __Closing of escrow account__ 

        If the order is approved in a referendum conducted under [section 7417(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7417/b/1]—

            (B) the funds shall be available to the board for disbursement as authorized in the order.
