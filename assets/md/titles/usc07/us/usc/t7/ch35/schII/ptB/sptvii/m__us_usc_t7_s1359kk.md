    (a) __Establishment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, at the beginning of the quota year, the Secretary shall establish the tariff-rate quotas for raw cane sugar and refined sugars at the minimum level necessary to comply with obligations under international trade agreements that have been approved by Congress.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to specialty sugar.

    (b) __Adjustment__ 

        (1) __Before April 1__

            (A) the Secretary shall take action to increase the supply of sugar in accordance with sections 1359cc(b)(2) and 1359ee(b) of this title, including an increase in the tariff-rate quota for raw cane sugar to accommodate the reassignment to imports; and

            (B) if there is still a shortage of sugar in the United States market, and marketing of domestic sugar has been maximized, and domestic raw cane sugar refining capacity has been maximized, the Secretary may increase the tariff-rate quota for refined sugars sufficient to accommodate the supply increase, if the further increase will not threaten to result in the forfeiture of sugar pledged as collateral for a loan under [section 7272 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7272].

        (2) __On or after April 1__ 

        On or after April 1 of each fiscal year—
