## § 1359cc. Establishment of flexible marketing allotments

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall establish flexible marketing allotments for sugar for any crop year in which the allotments are required under [section 1359bb(b) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359bb/b] in accordance with this section.

    (b) __Overall allotment quantity__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Secretary shall establish the overall quantity of sugar to be allotted for the crop year (referred to in this subpart as the “overall allotment quantity”) at a level that is—

            (A) sufficient to maintain raw and refined sugar prices above forfeiture levels to avoid forfeiture of sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation; but

            (B) not less than a quantity equal to 85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop year.

        (2) __Adjustment__ 

        Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust the overall allotment quantity to maintain—

            (A) raw and refined sugar prices above forfeiture levels to avoid the forfeiture of sugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation; and

            (B) adequate supplies of raw and refined sugar in the domestic market.

    (c) __Marketing allotment for sugar derived from sugar beets and sugar derived from sugarcane__ 

    The overall allotment quantity for the crop year shall be allotted between—

        (1) sugar derived from sugar beets by establishing a marketing allotment for a crop year at a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the crop year by 54.35 percent; and

        (2) sugar derived from sugarcane by establishing a marketing allotment for a crop year at a quantity equal to the product of multiplying the overall allotment quantity for the crop year by 45.65 percent.

    (d) __Filling cane sugar and beet sugar allotments__ 

        (1) __Cane sugar__ 

            Each marketing allotment for cane sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar processed from domestically grown sugarcane.

        (2) __Beet sugar__ 

            Each marketing allotment for beet sugar established under this section may only be filled with sugar domestically processed from sugar beets or in-process beet sugar.

    (e) __State cane sugar allotments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane shall be further allotted, among the States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner as provided in this subsection and [section 1359dd(b)(1)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359dd/b/1/D].

        (2) __Offshore allotment__ 

            (A) __Collectively__ 

                Prior to the allotment of sugar derived from sugarcane to any other State, 325,000 short tons, raw value shall be allotted to the offshore States.

            (B) __Individually__ 

            The collective offshore State allotment provided for under subparagraph (A) shall be further allotted among the offshore States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of—

                (i) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from the 1996 through 2000 crops;

                (ii) the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments for the crop year; and

                (iii) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the 3-year average of the 1998 through 2000 crop years.

        (3) __Mainland allotment__ 

        The allotment for sugar derived from sugarcane, less the amount provided for under paragraph (2), shall be allotted among the mainland States in the United States in which sugarcane is produced, after a hearing (if requested by the affected sugarcane processors and growers) and on such notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of—

            (A) past marketings of sugar, based on the average of the 2 highest years of production of raw cane sugar from the 1996 through 2000 crops;

            (B) the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments for the crop year; and

            (C) past processings of sugar from sugarcane, based on the 3 crop years with the greatest processings (in the mainland States collectively) during the 1991 through 2000 crop years.

    (f) __Filling cane sugar allotments__ 

        Except as provided in [section 1359ee of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359ee], a State cane sugar allotment established under subsection (e) for a crop year may be filled only with sugar processed from sugarcane grown in the State covered by the allotment.

    (g) __Adjustment of marketing allotments__ 

        (1) __Adjustments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, based on reestimates under [section 1359bb(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359bb/a/3], adjust upward or downward marketing allotments in a fair and equitable manner, as the Secretary determines appropriate, to reflect changes in estimated sugar consumption, stocks, production, or imports.

            (B) __Limitation__ 

                In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary may not reduce the overall allotment quantity to a quantity of less than 85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop year.

        (2) __Allocation to processors__ 

            In the case of any increase or decrease in an allotment, each allocation to a processor of the allotment under [section 1359dd of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359dd], and each proportionate share established with respect to the allotment under [section 1359ff(c) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1359ff/c], shall be increased or decreased by the same percentage that the allotment is increased or decreased.

        (3) __Carry-over of reductions__ 

            Whenever a marketing allotment for a crop year is required to be reduced during the crop year under this subsection, if, at the time of the reduction, the quantity of sugar marketed exceeds the processor’s reduced allocation, the allocation of an allotment next established for the processor shall be reduced by the quantity of the excess sugar marketed.
