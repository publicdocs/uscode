    (b) __Corporations or other entities__ 

        For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a corporation or other entity shall be considered a person that is ineligible for production adjustment payments, price support program loans, payments, or benefits if more than 10 percent of the beneficial ownership of the entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act \[[8 U.S.C. 1101][/us/usc/t8/s1101] et seq.\], unless such persons provide a substantial amount of personal labor in the production of crops on such farm.
