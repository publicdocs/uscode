    (a) __Definitions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In this section:

            (A) __Average adjusted gross income__ 

                The term “average adjusted gross income”, with respect to a person or legal entity, means the average of the adjusted gross income or comparable measure of the person or legal entity over the 3 taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by the Secretary.

            (B) __Average adjusted gross farm income__ 

                The term “average adjusted gross farm income”, with respect to a person or legal entity, means the average of the portion of adjusted gross income of the person or legal entity that is attributable to activities related to farming, ranching, or forestry for the 3 taxable years described in subparagraph (A), as determined by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (c).

            (C) __Average adjusted gross nonfarm income__ 

            The term “average adjusted gross nonfarm income”, with respect to a person or legal entity, means the difference between—

        (3) __Allocation of income__ 

        On the request of any person filing a joint tax return, the Secretary shall provide for the allocation of average adjusted gross income, average adjusted gross farm income, and average adjusted gross nonfarm income among the persons filing the return if—

            (A) the person provides a certified statement by a certified public accountant or attorney that specifies the method by which the average adjusted gross income, average adjusted gross farm income, and average adjusted gross nonfarm income would have been declared and reported had the persons filed 2 separate returns; and

            (B) the Secretary determines that the method described in the statement is consistent with the information supporting the filed joint tax return.
