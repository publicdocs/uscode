    (b) The right of a producer to demand a refund under subsection (a) of this section shall terminate if the proposed amendment of the order implementing the Cotton Research and Promotion Amendments Act of 1990 is approved in the referendum provided for under [section 2107 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s2107]. Such right shall terminate 30 days after the date the Secretary announces the results of such referendum if such proposed amendment is approved.
