    (a) __Action to restrain collection of tax or obtain declaratory judgment forbidden__ 

        No suit, action, or proceeding (including probate, administration, and receivership proceedings) shall be brought or maintained in any court if such suit, action, or proceeding is for the purpose or has the effect (1) of preventing or restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed or the amount of any penalty or interest accrued under this chapter on or after August 24, 1935, or (2) of obtaining a declaratory judgment under sections 2201 and 2202 of title 28 in connection with any such tax or such amount of any such interest or penalty. In probate, administration, receivership, or other similar proceedings, the claim of the United States for any such tax or such amount of any such interest or penalty, in the amount assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, shall be allowed and ordered to be paid, but the right to claim the refund or credit thereof and to maintain such claim pursuant to the applicable provisions of law, including subsection (d) of this section, may be reserved in the court’s order.

    (b) __Taxes imposed prior to__  __August 24, 1935__  __, legalized and ratified__
