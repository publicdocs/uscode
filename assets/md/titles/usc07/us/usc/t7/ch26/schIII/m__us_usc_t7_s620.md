## § 620. Falsely ascribing deductions or charges to taxes; penalty

    (a) Whoever in connection with the purchase of, or offer to purchase, any commodity, subject to any tax under this chapter, or which is to be subjected to any tax under this chapter, makes any statement, written or oral, (1) intended or calculated to lead any person to believe that any amount deducted from the market price or the agreed price of the commodity consists of a tax imposed under this chapter, or (2) ascribing a particular part of the deduction from the market price or the agreed price of the commodity, to a tax imposed under this chapter, knowing that such statement is false or that the tax is not so great as the amount deducted from the market price or the agreed price of the commodity, ascribed to such tax, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not exceeding six months, or both.

    (b) Whoever in connection with the processing of any commodity subject to any tax under this chapter, whether commercially, for toll, upon an exchange, or otherwise, makes any statement, written or oral, (1) intended or calculated to lead any person to believe that any part of the charge for said processing, whether commercially, for toll, upon an exchange, or otherwise, consists of a tax imposed under this chapter, or (2) ascribing a particular part of the charge for processing, whether commercially, for toll, upon an exchange, or otherwise, to a tax imposed under this chapter, knowing that such statement is false, or that the tax is not so great as the amount charged for said processing ascribed to such tax, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not exceeding six months, or both.

    (c) Whoever in connection with any settlement, under a contract to buy any commodity, and/or to sell such commodity, or any product or byproduct thereof, subject to any tax under this chapter, makes any statement, written or oral, (1) intended or calculated to lead any person to believe that any amount deducted from the gross sales price, in arriving at the basis of settlement under the contract, consists of a tax under this chapter, or (2) ascribing a particular amount deducted from the gross sales price, in arriving at the basis of settlement under the contract, to a tax imposed under this chapter, knowing that such statement is false, or that the tax is not so great as the amount so deducted and/or ascribed to such tax, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not exceeding six months, or both.
