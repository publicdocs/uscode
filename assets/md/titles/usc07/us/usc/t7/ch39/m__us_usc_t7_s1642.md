For the purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any report made or record kept, or of obtaining information required to be furnished in any report, but not so furnished, the President is authorized to examine such books, papers, records, accounts, correspondence, contracts, documents, and memoranda as are relevant to transactions under the International Wheat Agreement and are within the control of any such person.

    (c) __Penalty for violation__ 

        Any person failing to make any report or keep any record as required by or pursuant to this section, or making any false report or record or knowingly violating any rule or regulation of the President issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for each violation.

    (d) __Forfeiture for excessive exports or imports__

Any criminal proceeding may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred. Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or rules and regulations thereunder, or to enjoin any violation of such chapter or rules and regulations, may be brought in any such district wherein the defendant is found or is a resident or transacts business. The remedies, fines, and forfeitures provided for in this chapter shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any of the remedies, fines, and forfeitures under existing law.

    (f) __Delegation of authority__
