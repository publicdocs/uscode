            (B) the rate at which a marketing assistance loan for the loan commodity may be repaid under [section 7934 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7934].

        (2) __Unshorn pelts__ 

        In the case of unshorn pelts, the payment rate shall be the amount by which—

            (A) the loan rate established under [section 7932 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7932] for ungraded wool; exceeds

            (B) the rate at which a marketing assistance loan for ungraded wool may be repaid under [section 7934 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7934].

            (B) the rate at which a marketing assistance loan for the loan commodity may be repaid under [section 7934 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7934].

    (d) __Exception for extra long staple cotton__

        The Secretary shall determine the amount of the loan deficiency payment to be made under this section to the producers on a farm with respect to a quantity of a loan commodity or commodity referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section using the payment rate in effect under subsection (c) of this section as of the date the producers request the payment.

    (f) __Special loan deficiency payment rules__ 

        (1) __First-time loan commodities__ 

            For the 2002 crop of wool, mohair, honey, dry peas, lentils and small chickpeas, in the case of producers of such a crop that would be eligible for a loan deficiency payment under this section except for the fact that the producers lost beneficial interest in the crop prior to the date of publication of the regulations implementing this section, the producers shall be eligible for a loan deficiency payment as of the date producers marketed or otherwise lost beneficial interest in the crop, as determined by the Secretary.
