    (c) __National dairy policy defined__ 

    In this section, the term “national dairy policy” means the dairy policy of the United States as evidenced by the following policies and programs:

        (1) Federal milk marketing orders issued under [section 608c of this title][/us/usc/t7/s608c].

([Pub. L. 107–171, title I, § 1507][/us/pl/107/171/s1507], May 13, 2002, [116 Stat. 210][/us/stat/116/210].)

 __References in Text__ 

    H.R. 1827, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), which would have granted consent to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the Southern Dairy Compact, the Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact, and the Intermountain Dairy Compact, was not enacted into law during the 107th Congress.

    S. 1157, referred to in subsec. (c)(2), which would have granted consent to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the Southern Dairy Compact, the Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact, and the Intermountain Dairy Compact, was not enacted into law during the 107th Congress.

    [Section 7981 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7981], referred to in subsec. (c)(5), was in the original “section 1401”, and was translated as reading “section 1501”, meaning [section 1501 of Pub. L. 107–171][/us/pl/107/171/s1501] to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [section 1501 of Pub. L. 107–171][/us/pl/107/171/s1501] relates to Federal milk price support program. [Section 1401 of Pub. L. 107–171][/us/pl/107/171/s1401] amended sections 7272 and 7283 of this title.
