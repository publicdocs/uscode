            (D) to use the land on the farm, in a quantity equal to the attributable base acres for the farm and any base acres for peanuts for the farm under subchapter III of this chapter for an agricultural or conserving use, and not for a nonagricultural commercial or industrial use, as determined by the Secretary; and

            (E) to effectively control noxious weeds and otherwise maintain the land in accordance with sound agricultural practices, as determined by the Secretary, if the agricultural or conserving use involves the noncultivation of any portion of the land referred to in subparagraph (D).

        (2) __Compliance__ 

            The Secretary may issue such rules as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure producer compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1).

        (3) __Modification__ 

            At the request of the transferee or owner, the Secretary may modify the requirements of this subsection if the modifications are consistent with the objectives of this subsection, as determined by the Secretary.

    (b) __Transfer or change of interest in farm__ 

        (1) __Termination__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), a transfer of (or change in) the interest of the producers on a farm in base acres for which direct payments or counter-cyclical payments are made shall result in the termination of the payments with respect to the base acres, unless the transferee or owner of the acreage agrees to assume all obligations under subsection (a) of this section. The termination shall take effect on the date determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            If a producer entitled to a direct payment or counter-cyclical payment dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, the Secretary shall make the payment, in accordance with rules issued by the Secretary.

        As a condition on the receipt of any benefits under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary shall require producers on a farm to submit to the Secretary annual acreage reports with respect to all cropland on the farm.

    (d) __Tenants and sharecroppers__ 

        In carrying out this subchapter, the Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers.

    (e) __Sharing of payments__
