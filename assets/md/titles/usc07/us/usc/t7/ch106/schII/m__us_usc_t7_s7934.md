Northern Europe (referred to in this section as the “Northern Europe price”).

        (2) __Further adjustment__

        For the 2001 crop year only, in the case of the producers on a farm that marketed or otherwise lost beneficial interest in a loan commodity for which a marketing assistance loan was made under [section 7231 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7231] before repaying the loan, the Secretary shall permit the producers to repay the loan at the appropriate repayment rate that was in effect for the loan commodity under [section 7234 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s7234] on the date that the producers lost beneficial interest, as determined by the Secretary, if the Secretary determines the producers acted in good faith.
