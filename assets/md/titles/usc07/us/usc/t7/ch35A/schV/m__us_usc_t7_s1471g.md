([Oct. 31, 1949, ch. 792][/us/act/1949-10-31/ch792], title VI, § 609, as added [Pub. L. 100–387, title I, § 101(a)][/us/pl/100/387/s101/a], Aug. 11, 1988, [102 Stat. 930][/us/stat/102/930]; amended [Pub. L. 110–234, title I, § 1603(g)(2)][/us/pl/110/234/s1603/g/2], May 22, 2008, [122 Stat. 1011][/us/stat/122/1011]; [Pub.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 1703(a) of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), probably means [section 1603 of Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246/s1603], because [Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246] does not contain a section 1703 and subsec. (b)(3) of [section 1603 of Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246/s1603] amended [section 1308 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1308] by striking out provisions relating to issuance of regulations defining “person”.

    The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, referred to in subsecs. (c) and (d), is [Pub. L. 100–387][/us/pl/100/387], Aug. 11, 1988, [102 Stat. 924][/us/stat/102/924]. Section 211(c) of that act is set out as a note under [section 1421 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1421]. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under [section 1421 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1421] and Tables.
