## § 1444e–1. Loans and purchases for 1986 through 1996 crops of corn

    (a)

     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective only for each of the 1986 through 1996 crops of feed grains, the Secretary of Agriculture may make available loans and purchases, as provided in this section, to producers on a farm who—

        (1)

         for silage—

            (A) cut corn (including mutilated corn) that the producers have produced in such crop year; or

            (B) purchase or exchange corn (including mutilated corn) that has been produced in such crop year by another producer (including a producer that is not participating in an acreage limitation or set-aside program for such crop established by the Secretary); and

        (2) participate in an acreage limitation or set-aside program for such crop of corn established by the Secretary.

    (b)

     Such loans and purchases may be made on a quantity of corn of the same crop, other than the corn obtained for silage, acquired by the producer equivalent to a quantity determined by multiplying—

        (1) the acreage of corn obtained for silage; by

        (2) the lower of the farm program payment yield or the actual yield on a field, as determined by the Secretary, that is similar to the field from which such silage was obtained.
