     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section—

        (1) if producers have not disapproved marketing quotas for such crop, the level of support to cooperators shall be 90 per centum of the parity price for the 1950 crop of any basic agricultural commodity for which marketing quotas or acreage allotments are in effect;

        (2) if producers have not disapproved marketing quotas for such crop, the level of support to cooperators shall be not less than 80 per centum of the parity price for the 1951 crop of any basic agricultural commodity for which marketing quotas or acreage allotments are in effect;

        (3) the level of price support to cooperators for any crop of a basic agricultural commodity for which marketing quotas have been disapproved by producers shall be 50 per centum of the parity price of such commodity;

        (4) Repealed. [Oct. 31, 1949, ch. 792][/us/act/1949-10-31/ch792], title I, § 104(b)(3), as added Aug. 28, 1958, [Pub. L. 85–835, title II, § 201][/us/pl/85/835/s201], [72 Stat. 994][/us/stat/72/994];

        (5) price support may be made available to noncooperators at such levels, not in excess of the level of price support to cooperators, as the Secretary determines will facilitate the effective operation of the program. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. </sup></sup> 

        (6) Except  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized. </sup></sup>  as provided in subsection (c) of this section and [section 1422 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1422], the level of support to cooperators shall be not more than 90 per centum and not less than 82½ per centum of the parity price for the 1955 crop of any basic agricultural commodity with respect to which producers have not disapproved marketing quotas; within such limits, the minimum level of support shall be fixed as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.1

        (7) Where a State is designated under [section 1335(e) of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1335/e], as outside the commercial wheat-producing area for any crop of wheat, the level of price support for wheat to cooperators in such State for such crop of wheat shall be 75 per centum of the level of price support to cooperators in the commercial wheat-producing area.

    (d)  __Rice__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary shall make available to producers of each crop of rice on a farm price support at a level that is not less than 50 percent, or more than 90 percent of the parity price for rice as the Secretary determines will not result in increasing stocks of rice to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
