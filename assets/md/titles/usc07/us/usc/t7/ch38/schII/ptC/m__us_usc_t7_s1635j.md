## § 1635j. Mandatory reporting for swine

    (a) __Establishment__ 

    The Secretary shall establish a program of swine price information reporting that will—

        (1) provide timely, accurate, and reliable market information;

        (2) facilitate more informed marketing decisions; and

        (3) promote competition in the swine slaughtering industry.

    (b) __General reporting provisions applicable to packers and the Secretary__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall establish and implement a price reporting program in accordance with this section that includes the reporting and publication of information required under this section.

        (2) __Packer-owned swine__ 

            Information required under this section for packer-owned swine shall include quantity and carcass characteristics, but not price.

        (3) __Packer-sold swine__ 

        If information regarding the type of purchase is required under this section, the information shall be reported according to the numbers and percentages of each type of purchase comprising—

            (A) packer-sold swine; and

            (B) all other swine.

        (4) __Additional information__ 

            (A) __Review__ 

                The Secretary shall review the information required to be reported by packers under this section at least once every 2 years.

            (B) __Outdated information__ 

            After public notice and an opportunity for comment, subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall promulgate regulations that specify additional information that shall be reported under this section if the Secretary determines under the review under subparagraph (A) that—

                (i) information that is currently required no longer accurately reflects the methods by which swine are valued and priced by packers; or

                (ii) packers that slaughter a significant majority of the swine produced in the United States no longer use backfat or lean percentage factors as indicators of price.

            (C) __Limitation__ 

            Under subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not require packers to provide any new or additional information that—

                (i) is not generally available or maintained by packers; or

                (ii) would be otherwise unduly burdensome to provide.

    (c) __Daily reporting; barrows and gilts__ 

        (1) __Prior day report__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The corporate officers or officially designated representatives of each packer processing plant that processes barrows or gilts shall report to the Secretary, for each business day of the packer, such information as the Secretary determines necessary and appropriate to—

                (ii) provide for the timely access to the information by producers, packers, and other market participants.

            (B) __Reporting deadline and plants required to report__

                (ii)

                 all slaughter data for the total number of barrows and gilts slaughtered, including—

                    (I)

                     information concerning the net price, which shall be equal to the total amount paid by a packer to a producer (including all premiums, less all discounts) per hundred pounds of carcass weight of barrows and gilts delivered at the plant—

                        (aa) including any sum deducted from the price per hundredweight paid to a producer that reflects the repayment of a balance owed by the producer to the packer or the accumulation of a balance to later be repaid by the packer to the producer; and

                    (II)

                     information concerning the average net price, which shall be equal to the quotient (stated per hundred pounds of carcass weight of barrows and gilts) obtained by dividing—

                        (aa) the total amount paid for the barrows and gilts slaughtered at a packing plant during the applicable reporting period, including all premiums and discounts, and including any sum deducted from the price per hundredweight paid to a producer that reflects the repayment of a balance owed by the producer to the packer, or the accumulation of a balance to later be repaid by the packer to the producer, less all discounts; by

                    (VI) the average sort loss, which shall be equal to the average discount (in dollars per hundred pounds carcass weight) for barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, resulting from the fact that the barrows and gilts did not fall within the individual packer’s established carcass weight or lot variation range;

                    (VIII) the average lean percentage, which shall be equal to the average percentage of the carcass weight comprised of lean meat for the barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, except that when a packer is required to report the average lean percentage under this subclause, the packer shall make available to the Secretary the underlying data, applicable methodology and formulae, and supporting materials used to determine the average lean percentage, which the Secretary may convert to the carcass measurements or lean percentage of the barrows and gilts of the individual packer to correlate to a common percent lean measurement; and

                    (IX) the total slaughter quantity, which shall be equal to the total number of barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, including all types of purchases and barrows and gilts that qualify as packer-owned swine; and
