## § 2204d. Encouragement of private contracting

    (a) __In general__ 

        For the purpose of promoting local job creation and private sector investment in rural communities, the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged, where appropriate and feasible, to use private enterprise concerns located in rural areas, rather than government employees or government enterprises, to provide commercial activities or products to carry out the purposes of this title. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

    (b) __Plan required__ 

        The Secretary shall develop and implement a plan that will result in increasing the use of contracts awarded to private firms by the Department of Agriculture, and maximizing the use of grant, loan, or other financial assistance made for the purpose of rural development to provide the goods and services purchased to carry out the purposes of this title.1
