## § 2279a. Fair and equitable treatment of socially disadvantaged producers

    (a) __Fair crop acreage bases and farm program payment yields__ 

        If the Secretary of Agriculture determines that crop acreage bases or farm program payment yields established for farms owned or operated by socially disadvantaged producers are not established in accordance with title V of the Agricultural Act of 1949 ([7 U.S.C. 1461][/us/usc/t7/s1461] et seq.), the Secretary shall adjust the bases and yields to conform to the requirements of such title and make available any appropriate commodity program benefits.

    (b) __Fair application of Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act__ 

        If the Secretary of Agriculture determines that application of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act ([7 U.S.C. 1921][/us/usc/t7/s1921] et seq.) with respect to socially disadvantaged producers is not consistent with the requirements of such Act, the Secretary shall make such changes in the administration of such Act as the Secretary considers necessary to provide for the fair and equitable treatment of socially disadvantaged producers under such Act.

    (c) __Report on treatment of socially disadvantaged producers__ 

        (1) __Report required__ 

        The Comptroller General of the United States shall prepare a report to determine—

            (A) whether socially disadvantaged producers are underrepresented on State, county, area, or local committees established under [section 590h(b)(5) of title 16][/us/usc/t16/s590h/b/5] or local review committees established under [section 1363 of this title][/us/usc/t7/s1363] because of racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice; and

            (B) if such underrepresentation exists, whether it inhibits or interferes with the participation of socially disadvantaged producers in programs of the Department of Agriculture.

        (2) __Submission of report__ 

            Not later than February 1, 1995, the Comptroller General shall submit the report required by this subsection to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

    (d) __“Socially disadvantaged producer” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “socially disadvantaged producer” means a producer who is a member of a group whose members have been subjected to racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.
