        The total amount of the fees assessed for each fiscal year pursuant to this section shall be sufficient, and shall not exceed the amount necessary, to recoup the total expenses of the First Responder Network Authority in carrying out its duties and responsibilities described under this subchapter for the fiscal year involved.

    (c) __Annual approval__ 

        The NTIA shall review the fees assessed under this section on an annual basis, and such fees may only be assessed if approved by the NTIA.
