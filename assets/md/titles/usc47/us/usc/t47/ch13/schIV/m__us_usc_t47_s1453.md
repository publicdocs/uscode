        (2) __Required determinations__ 

        The Commission may make the modification described in paragraph (1) only if the Commission, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary, determines that—

            (A) licensed users will be protected by technical solutions, including use of existing, modified, or new spectrum-sharing technologies and solutions, such as dynamic frequency selection; and

            (B) the primary mission of Federal spectrum users in the 5350–5470 MHz band will not be compromised by the introduction of unlicensed devices.

    (b) __Study by NTIA__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Defense and other impacted agencies, shall conduct a study evaluating known and proposed spectrum-sharing technologies and the risk to Federal users if unlicensed U–NII devices were allowed to operate in the 5350–5470 MHz band and in the 5850–5925 MHz band.
