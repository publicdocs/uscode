## § 1104. Administration of loan guarantees

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service (in this chapter referred to as the “Administrator”) shall issue and otherwise administer loan guarantees that have been approved by the Board in accordance with sections 1102 and 1103 of this title.

    (b) __Security for protection of United States financial interests__ 

        (1) __Terms and conditions__ 

        An applicant shall agree to such terms and conditions as are satisfactory, in the judgment of the Board, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on a loan guaranteed under this chapter, the applicant—

            (A) shall maintain assets, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis;

            (B) shall not make any discretionary dividend payments that impair its ability to repay obligations guaranteed under this chapter;

            (C) shall remain sufficiently capitalized; and

            (D) shall submit to, and cooperate fully with, any audit of the applicant under [section 1105(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1105/a/2].

        (2) __Collateral__ 

            (A) __Existence of adequate collateral__ 

                An applicant shall provide the Board such documentation as is necessary, in the judgment of the Board, to provide satisfactory evidence that appropriate and adequate collateral secures a loan guaranteed under this chapter.

            (B) __Form of collateral__ 

                Collateral required by subparagraph (A) shall consist solely of assets of the applicant, any affiliate of the applicant, or both (whichever the Board considers appropriate), including primary assets to be used in the delivery of signals for which the loan is guaranteed.

            (C) __Review of valuation__ 

                The value of collateral securing a loan guaranteed under this chapter may be reviewed by the Board, and may be adjusted downward by the Board if the Board reasonably believes such adjustment is appropriate.

        (3) __Lien on interests in assets__ 

            Upon the Board’s approval of a loan guarantee under this chapter, the Administrator shall have liens on assets securing the loan, which shall be superior to all other liens on such assets, and the value of the assets (based on a determination satisfactory to the Board) subject to the liens shall be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan amount covered by the loan guarantee, or that value approved by the Board under [section 1103(d)(3)(B)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1103/d/3/B/iii].

        (4) __Perfected security interest__ 

            With respect to a loan guaranteed under this chapter, the Administrator and the lender shall have a perfected security interest in assets securing the loan that are fully sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and the lender.

        (5) __Insurance__ 

            In accordance with practices in the private capital market, as determined by the Board, the applicant for a loan guarantee under this chapter shall obtain, at its expense, insurance sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States, as determined by the Board.

    (e) __Adjustment__ 

    The Board may approve the adjustment of any term or condition of a loan guarantee or a loan guaranteed under this chapter, including the rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest, or security requirements only if—

        (2) consent has been obtained from the parties to the loan agreement;

        (3) the adjustment is consistent with the underwriting criteria developed under [section 1103(g) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1103/g];

        (4) the adjustment does not adversely affect the interest of the Federal Government in the assets or collateral of the applicant;

        (5) the adjustment does not adversely affect the ability of the applicant to repay the loan; and
