## § 765g. Exclusivity arrangements

    (a) __In general__ 

        No satellite operator shall acquire or enjoy the exclusive right of handling telecommunications to or from the United States, its territories or possessions, and any other country or territory by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which the satellite operator or any persons or companies controlling or controlled by the operator are parties.

    (b) __Exception__ 

    In enforcing the provisions of this section, the Commission—

        (1) shall not require the termination of existing satellite telecommunications services under contract with, or tariff commitment to, such satellite operator; but

        (2) may require the termination of new services only to the country that has provided the exclusive right to handle telecommunications, if the Commission determines the public interest, convenience, and necessity so requires.
