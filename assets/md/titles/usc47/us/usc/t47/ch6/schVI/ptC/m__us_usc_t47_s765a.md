## § 765a. Signatory role

    (a) __Limitations on signatories__ 

        (1) __National security limitations__ 

            The Federal Communications Commission, after a public interest determination, in consultation with the executive branch, may restrict foreign ownership of a United States signatory if the Commission determines that not to do so would constitute a threat to national security.

        (2) __No signatories required__ 

            The United States Government shall not require signatories to represent the United States in INTELSAT or Inmarsat or in any successor entities after a pro-competitive privatization is achieved consistent with sections 763, 763a, and 763c  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title.

    (b) __Clarification of privileges and immunities of COMSAT__ 

        (1) __Generally not immunized__ 

            Notwithstanding any other law or executive agreement, COMSAT shall not be entitled to any privileges or immunities under the laws of the United States or any State on the basis of its status as a signatory of INTELSAT or Inmarsat.

        (2) __Limited immunity__ 

            COMSAT or any successor in interest shall not be liable for action taken by it in carrying out the specific, written instruction of the United States issued in connection with its relationships and activities with foreign governments, international entities, and the intergovernmental satellite organizations.

        (3) __No joint or several liability__ 

            If COMSAT is found liable for any action taken in its status as a signatory or a representative of the party to INTELSAT, any such liability shall be limited to the portion of the judgment that corresponds to COMSAT’s percentage of the ownership of INTELSAT at the time the activity began which lead to the liability.

        (4) __Provisions prospective__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to liability for any action taken by COMSAT before March 17, 2000.

    (c) __Parity of treatment__ 

        Notwithstanding any other law or executive agreement, the Commission shall have the authority to impose similar regulatory fees on the United States signatory which it imposes on other entities providing similar services.
