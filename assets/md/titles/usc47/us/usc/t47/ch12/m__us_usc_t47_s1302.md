## § 1302. Advanced telecommunications incentives

    (a) __In general__ 

        The Commission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) by utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.

    (b) __Inquiry__ 

        The Commission shall, within 30 months after February 8, 1996, and annually thereafter, initiate a notice of inquiry concerning the availability of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) and shall complete the inquiry within 180 days after its initiation. In the inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. If the Commission’s determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.

    (c) __Demographic information for unserved areas__ 

    As part of the inquiry required by subsection (b), the Commission shall compile a list of geographical areas that are not served by any provider of advanced telecommunications capability (as defined by subsection (d)(1))  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and to the extent that data from the Census Bureau is available, determine, for each such unserved area—

        (1) the population;

        (2) the population density; and

        (3) the average per capita income.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this subsection:  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “section:”. </sup></sup>
