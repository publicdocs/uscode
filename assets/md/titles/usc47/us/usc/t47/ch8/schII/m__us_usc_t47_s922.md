## § 922. National spectrum allocation planning

    The Assistant Secretary and the Chairman of the Commission shall meet, at least biannually, to conduct joint spectrum planning with respect to the following issues:

    (1) the extent to which licenses for spectrum use can be issued pursuant to [section 309(j) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s309/j] to increase Federal revenues;

    (2) the future spectrum requirements for public and private uses, including State and local government public safety agencies;

    (3) the spectrum allocation actions necessary to accommodate those uses; and

    (4) actions necessary to promote the efficient use of the spectrum, including spectrum management techniques to promote increased shared use of the spectrum that does not cause harmful interference as a means of increasing commercial access.
