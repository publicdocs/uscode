## § 928. Spectrum Relocation Fund

    (a) __Establishment of Spectrum Relocation Fund__ 

        There is established on the books of the Treasury a separate fund to be known as the “Spectrum Relocation Fund” (in this section referred to as the “Fund”), which shall be administered by the Office of Management and Budget (in this section referred to as “OMB”), in consultation with the NTIA.

    (b) __Crediting of receipts__ 

        The Fund shall be credited with the amounts specified in [section 309(j)(8)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s309/j/8/D].

    (c) __Use of funds__ 

        The amounts in the Fund from auctions of eligible frequencies are authorized to be used to pay relocation or sharing costs of an eligible Federal entity incurring such costs with respect to relocation from or sharing of those frequencies.

    (d) __Fund availability__ 

        (1) __Appropriation__ 

            There are hereby appropriated from the Fund such sums as are required to pay the relocation or sharing costs specified in subsection (c) of this section.

        (2) __Transfer conditions__ 

        None of the funds provided under this subsection may be transferred to any eligible Federal entity—

            (A) unless the eligible Federal entity has submitted a transition plan to the NTIA as required by paragraph (1) of [section 923(h) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/h], the Technical Panel has found such plan sufficient under paragraph (4) of such section, and the NTIA has made available such plan on its website as required by paragraph (5) of such section;

            (B) unless the Director of OMB has determined, in consultation with the NTIA, the appropriateness of such costs and the timeline for relocation or sharing; and

            (C) until 30 days after the Director of OMB has submitted to the Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a detailed plan describing specifically how the sums transferred from the Fund will be used to pay relocation or sharing costs in accordance with such subsection and the timeline for such relocation or sharing.

            Unless disapproved within 30 days, the amounts in the Fund shall be available immediately. If the plan is disapproved, the Director may resubmit a revised plan.

        (3) __Transfers for pre-auction costs__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (B), the Director of OMB may transfer to an eligible Federal entity, at any time (including prior to a scheduled auction), such sums as may be available in the Fund to pay relocation or sharing costs related to pre-auction estimates or research, as such costs are described in [section 923(g)(3)(A)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/g/3/A/iii].

            (B) __Notification__ 

            No funds may be transferred pursuant to subparagraph (A) unless—

                (i)

                 the notification provided under paragraph (2)(C) includes a certification from the Director of OMB that—

                    (I) funds transferred before an auction will likely allow for timely implementation of relocation or sharing, thereby increasing net expected auction proceeds by an amount not less than the time value of the amount of funds transferred; and

                    (II) the auction is intended to occur not later than 5 years after transfer of funds; and

                (ii)

                 the transition plan submitted by the eligible Federal entity under [section 923(h)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/h/1] provides—

                    (I) to the fullest extent possible, for sharing and coordination of eligible frequencies with non-Federal users, including reasonable accommodation by the eligible Federal entity for the use of eligible frequencies by non-Federal users during the period that the entity is relocating its spectrum uses (in this clause referred to as the “transition period”);

                    (II) for non-Federal users to be able to use eligible frequencies during the transition period in geographic areas where the eligible Federal entity does not use such frequencies;

                    (III) that the eligible Federal entity will, during the transition period, make itself available for negotiation and discussion with non-Federal users not later than 30 days after a written request therefor; and

                    (IV) that the eligible Federal entity will, during the transition period, make available to a non-Federal user with appropriate security clearances any classified information (as defined in [section 798(b) of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s798/b]) regarding the relocation process, on a need-to-know basis, to assist the non-Federal user in the relocation process with such eligible Federal entity or other eligible Federal entities.

            (C) __Applicability to certain costs__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Director of OMB may transfer under subparagraph (A) not more than $10,000,000 for costs incurred after June 28, 2010, but before February 22, 2012.

                (ii) __Supplement not supplant__ 

                    Any amounts transferred by the Director of OMB pursuant to clause (i) shall be in addition to any amounts that the Director of OMB may transfer for costs incurred on or after February 22, 2012.

        (4) __Reversion of unused funds__ 

            Any amounts in the Fund that are remaining after the payment of the relocation or sharing costs that are payable from the Fund shall revert to and be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury, for the sole purpose of deficit reduction, not later than 8 years after the date of the deposit of such proceeds to the Fund, unless within 60 days in advance of the reversion of such funds, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the NTIA, notifies the congressional committees described in paragraph (2)(C) that such funds are needed to complete or to implement current or future relocation or sharing arrangements.

    (e) __Transfer to eligible Federal entities__ 

        (1) __Transfer__ 

            (A) Amounts made available pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall be transferred to eligible Federal entities, as defined in [section 923(g)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/g/1].

            (B)

             An eligible Federal entity may receive more than one such transfer, but if the sum of the subsequent transfer or transfers exceeds 10 percent of the original transfer—

                (i) such subsequent transfers are subject to prior approval by the Director of OMB as required by subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section;

                (ii) the notice to the committees containing the plan required by subsection (d)(2)(C) of this section shall be not less than 45 days prior to the date of the transfer that causes such excess above 10 percent; and

                (iii) such notice shall include, in addition to such plan, an explanation of need for such subsequent transfer or transfers.

            (C) Such transferred amounts shall be credited to the appropriations account of the eligible Federal entity which has incurred, or will incur, such costs, and shall, subject to paragraph (2), remain available until expended.

        (2) __Retransfer to fund__ 

            An eligible Federal entity that has received such amounts shall report its expenditures to OMB and shall transfer any amounts in excess of actual relocation or sharing costs back to the Fund immediately after the NTIA has notified the Commission that the relocation of the entity or implementation of the sharing arrangement by the entity is complete, or has determined that such entity has unreasonably failed to complete such relocation or the implementation of such arrangement in accordance with the timeline required by subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section.

    (f) __Additional payments from Fund__ 

        (1) __Amounts available__ 

            Notwithstanding subsections (c) through (e), after February 22, 2012, there are appropriated from the Fund and available to the Director of OMB for use in accordance with paragraph (2) not more than 10 percent of the amounts deposited in the Fund from auctions occurring after such date of licenses for the use of spectrum vacated by eligible Federal entities.

            (B) __Conditions__ 

            In the case of any payment by the Director of OMB under subparagraph (A)—

                (i) such payment shall be based on the market value of the eligible frequencies, the timeliness with which the eligible Federal entity clears its use of such frequencies, and the need for such frequencies in order for the entity to conduct its essential missions;

                (ii) the eligible Federal entity shall use such payment for the purposes specified in clauses (i) through (v) of [section 923(g)(3)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/g/3/A] to achieve comparable capability of systems affected by the reallocation of eligible frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use;

                (iii) such payment may not be made if the amount remaining in the Fund after such payment will be less than 10 percent of the winning bids in the auction of the spectrum with respect to which the Federal entity is incurring relocation or sharing costs; and

                (iv) such payment may not be made until 30 days after the Director of OMB has notified the congressional committees described in subsection (d)(2)(C).

        (2) __Use of amounts__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Director of OMB may use amounts made available under paragraph (1) to make payments requested by Federal entities for research and development, engineering studies, economic analyses, activities with respect to systems, or other planning activities intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the spectrum use of Federal entities in order to make available frequencies described in subparagraph (C) for reallocation for non-Federal use or shared Federal and non-Federal use, or a combination thereof, and for auction in accordance with such reallocation.

            (B) __Systems that improve efficiency and effectiveness of Federal spectrum use__ 

            For purposes of a payment under subparagraph (A) for activities with respect to systems that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the spectrum use of Federal entities, such systems include the following:

                (i)

                 unless—

                    (I) the Federal entity has submitted to the Technical Panel established under [section 923(h)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s923/h/3] a plan describing the activities that the Federal entity will conduct with such payment;
