> “Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \[Feb. 8, 1996\], the Commission shall, pursuant to section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 \[[47 U.S.C. 303][/us/usc/t47/s303]\], promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer’s ability to receive video programming services through devices designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or direct broadcast satellite services.”

 __Parental Choice in Television Programming__ 

[Pub. L. 104–104, title V][/us/pl/104/104/tV], § 551(a), Feb. 8, 1996, [110 Stat. 139][/us/stat/110/139], provided that: 

> “The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) Television influences children’s perception of the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.

>     “(2) Television station operators, cable television system operators, and video programmers should follow practices in connection with video programming that take into consideration that television broadcast and cable programming has established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American children.

>     “(3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of television each week and some children are exposed to as much as 11 hours of television a day.

>     “(4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming are prone to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior.

>     “(5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on television by the time the child completes elementary school.

>     “(6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on television, eroding the ability of parents to develop responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.

>     “(7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual video programming and strongly support technology that would give them greater control to block video programming in the home that they consider harmful to their children.

>     “(8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering parents to limit the negative influences of video programming that is harmful to children.

>     “(9) Providing parents with timely information about the nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other programming that they believe harmful to their children is a nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that compelling governmental interest.”

 __Advisory Committee Requirements__ 

[Pub. L. 104–104, title V][/us/pl/104/104/tV], § 551(b)(2), Feb. 8, 1996, [110 Stat. 140][/us/stat/110/140], provided that: 

> “In establishing an advisory committee for purposes of the amendment made by paragraph (1) of this subsection \[amending this section\], the Commission shall—

>     “(A) ensure that such committee is composed of parents, television broadcasters, television programming producers, cable operators, appropriate public interest groups, and other interested individuals from the private sector and is fairly balanced in terms of political affiliation, the points of view represented, and the functions to be performed by the committee;

>     “(B) provide to the committee such staff and resources as may be necessary to permit it to perform its functions efficiently and promptly; and

>     “(C) require the committee to submit a final report of its recommendations within one year after the date of the appointment of the initial members.”

> “It is the policy of the United States to encourage broadcast television, cable, satellite, syndication, other video programming distributors, and relevant related industries (in consultation with appropriate public interest groups and interested individuals from the private sector) to—

>     “(1) establish a technology fund to encourage television and electronics equipment manufacturers to facilitate the development of technology which would empower parents to block programming they deem inappropriate for their children and to encourage the availability thereof to low income parents;

>     “(2) report to the viewing public on the status of the development of affordable, easy to use blocking technology; and

>     “(3) establish and promote effective procedures, standards, systems, advisories, or other mechanisms for ensuring that users have easy and complete access to the information necessary to effectively utilize blocking technology and to encourage the availability thereof to low income parents.”

 __AM Radio Improvement Standard__ 

    [Pub. L. 102–538, title II][/us/pl/102/538/tII], § 214, Oct. 27, 1992, [106 Stat. 3546][/us/stat/106/3546], required the Federal Communications Commission to initiate a rulemaking to adopt an AM radio improvement standard within 60 days after Oct. 27, 1992, and to adopt such standard within 1 year after Oct. 27, 1992.

> “The Federal Communications Commission shall promulgate regulations to prohibit the broadcasting of indecent programming—

>     “(1) between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on any day by any public radio station or public television station that goes off the air at or before 12 midnight; and

>     “(2) between 6 a.m. and 12 midnight on any day for any radio or television broadcasting station not described in paragraph (1).

>     The regulations required under this subsection shall be promulgated in accordance with [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553], United States Code, and shall become final not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \[Aug. 26, 1992\].”

 __Congressional Findings Regarding Access by Hearing-Impaired People to Television Medium__ 

[Pub. L. 101–431][/us/pl/101/431], § 2, Oct. 15, 1990, [104 Stat. 960][/us/stat/104/960], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1) to the fullest extent made possible by technology, deaf and hearing-impaired people should have equal access to the television medium;

>     “(2) closed-captioned television transmissions have made it possible for thousands of deaf and hearing-impaired people to gain access to the television medium, thus significantly improving the quality of their lives;

>     “(3) closed-captioned television will provide access to information, entertainment, and a greater understanding of our Nation and the world to over 24,000,000 people in the United States who are deaf or hearing-impaired;

>     “(4) closed-captioned television will provide benefits for the nearly 38 percent of older Americans who have some loss of hearing;

>     “(5) closed-captioned television can assist both hearing and hearing-impaired children with reading and other learning skills, and improve literacy skills among adults;

>     “(6) closed-captioned television can assist those among our Nation’s large immigrant population who are learning English as a second language with language comprehension;

>     “(7) currently, a consumer must buy a TeleCaption decoder and connect the decoder to a television set in order to display the closed-captioned television transmissions;

>     “(8) technology is now available to enable that closed-caption decoding capability to be built into new television sets during manufacture at a nominal cost by 1991; and

>     “(9) the availability of decoder-equipped television sets will significantly increase the audience that can be served by closed-captioned television, and such increased market will be an incentive to the television medium to provide more captioned programming.”

 __Direction on Use of Funds Regarding Spectrum Allocation and Assignments for Public Safety Purposes__ 

[Pub. L. 98–214][/us/pl/98/214], § 9, Dec. 8, 1983, [97 Stat. 1470][/us/stat/97/1470], provided that:

>     “(a) Funds authorized to be appropriated under section 2 of this Act \[amending [section 156 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s156]\] shall be used by the Federal Communications Commission to establish a plan which adequately ensures that the needs of State and local public safety authorities would be taken into account in making allocations of the electromagnetic spectrum. In establishing such a plan the Commission shall (1) review the current and future needs of such public safety authorities in light of suitable and commercially available equipment and (2) consider the need for a nationwide contiguous frequency allocation for public safety purposes.

>     “(b) Pending adoption of a plan, the Commission, while making assignments and allocations, shall duly recognize the needs of State and local public safety authorities.”
