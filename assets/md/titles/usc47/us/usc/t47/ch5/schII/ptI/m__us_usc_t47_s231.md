 __Effective Date__ 

    Section effective 30 days after Oct. 21, 1998, see [section 1406 of Pub. L. 105–277][/us/pl/105/277/s1406], set out as a note under [section 223 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s223].

 __Congressional Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 105–277, div. C, title XIV][/us/pl/105/277/dC/tXIV], § 1402, Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2681–736][/us/stat/112/2681-736], provided that: 

> “The Congress finds that—

>     “(1) while custody, care, and nurture of the child resides first with the parent, the widespread availability of the Internet presents opportunities for minors to access materials through the World Wide Web in a manner that can frustrate parental supervision or control;

>     “(2) the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from materials that are harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest;

>     “(3) to date, while the industry has developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;

>     “(4) a prohibition on the distribution of material harmful to minors, combined with legitimate defenses, is currently the most effective and least restrictive means by which to satisfy the compelling government interest; and

>     “(5) notwithstanding the existence of protections that limit the distribution over the World Wide Web of material that is harmful to minors, parents, educators, and industry must continue efforts to find ways to protect children from being exposed to harmful material found on the Internet.”
