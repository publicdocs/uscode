## “SEC. 3013. SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE FEES.

>     “In addition to any fees assessed under the Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. 151][/us/usc/t47/s151] et seq.), the Federal Communications Commission shall assess extraordinary fees for licenses in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000, which shall be deposited in the Treasury during fiscal year 2006 as offsetting receipts.”

\[[Pub. L. 111–4, § 3(d)][/us/pl/111/4/s3/d], Feb. 11, 2009, [123 Stat. 113][/us/stat/123/113], provided that: 

> “The amendments made by this section \[amending [section 3005(c)(1) of Pub. L. 109–171][/us/pl/109/171/s3005/c/1], set out above\] shall not take effect until the enactment of additional budget authority after the date of enactment of this Act \[Feb. 11, 2009\] to carry out the analog-to-digital converter box program under section 3005 of the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 \[[section 3005 of Pub. L. 109–171][/us/pl/109/171/s3005], set out above\].”

\]

 __Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 107–195, § 2][/us/pl/107/195/s2], June 19, 2002, [116 Stat. 715][/us/stat/116/715], provided that: 

> “Congress finds the following:

>     “(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.

>     “(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.

>     “(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.

>     “(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.

>     “(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.

>     “(6)

>      The Commission’s rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations—

>         “(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and

>         “(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.”

> “The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)][/us/usc/t47/s309/j/11]).”

> “Nothing in this Act \[see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under [section 609 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s609]\] shall be construed to relieve television broadcast station licensees of the obligation to complete the digital television service conversion as required by section 309(j)(14) of the Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. 309(j)(14)][/us/usc/t47/s309/j/14]).”
