## § 228. Regulation of carrier offering of pay-per-call services

    (a) __Purpose__ 

    It is the purpose of this section—

        (1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and

        (2) to recognize the Commission’s authority to prescribe regulations and enforcement procedures and conduct oversight to afford reasonable protection to consumers of pay-per-call services and to assure that violations of Federal law do not occur.

    (b) __General authority for regulations__ 

    The Commission by regulation shall, within 270 days after October 28, 1992, establish a system for oversight and regulation of pay-per-call services in order to provide for the protection of consumers in accordance with this chapter and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Commission’s final rules shall—

        (1) include measures that provide a consumer of pay-per-call services with adequate and clear descriptions of the rights of the caller;

        (2) define the obligations of common carriers with respect to the provision of pay-per-call services;

        (3) include requirements on such carriers to protect against abusive practices by providers of pay-per-call services;

        (4) identify procedures by which common carriers and providers of pay-per-call services may take affirmative steps to protect against nonpayment of legitimate charges; and

        (5) require that any service described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (i)(1) of this section be offered only through the use of certain telephone number prefixes and area codes.

    (c) __Common carrier obligations__ 

    Within 270 days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following requirements for common carriers:

        (1) __Contractual obligations to comply__ 

            Any common carrier assigning to a provider of pay-per-call services a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section shall require by contract or tariff that such provider comply with the provisions of titles II and III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act \[[15 U.S.C. 5711][/us/usc/t15/s5711] et seq.; 5721 et seq.\] and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to those titles.

        (2) __Information availability__ 

        A common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of a pay-per-call service shall make readily available on request to Federal and State agencies and other interested persons—

            (A) a list of the telephone numbers for each of the pay-per-call services it carries;

            (B) a short description of each such service;

            (C) a statement of the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for each such service;

            (D) a statement of the pay-per-call service’s name, business address, and business telephone; and

            (E) such other information as the Commission considers necessary for the enforcement of this section and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations.

        (3) __Compliance procedures__ 

            A common carrier that by contract or tariff assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of pay-per-call services shall terminate, in accordance with procedures specified in such regulations, the offering of a pay-per-call service of a provider if the carrier knows or reasonably should know that such service is not provided in compliance with title II or III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act \[[15 U.S.C. 5711][/us/usc/t15/s5711] et seq.; 5721 et seq.\] or the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to such titles.

        (4) __Subscriber disconnection prohibited__ 

            A common carrier shall not disconnect or interrupt a subscriber’s local exchange telephone service or long distance telephone service because of nonpayment of charges for any pay-per-call service.

        (5) __Blocking and presubscription__ 

        A common carrier that provides local exchange service shall—

            (A)

             offer telephone subscribers (where technically feasible) the option of blocking access from their telephone number to all, or to certain specific, prefixes or area codes used by pay-per-call services, which option—

                (i) shall be offered at no charge (I) to all subscribers for a period of 60 days after the issuance of the regulations under subsection (b) of this section, and (II) to any subscriber who subscribes to a new telephone number until 60 days after the time the new telephone number is effective; and

                (ii) shall otherwise be offered at a reasonable fee; and

            (B) offer telephone subscribers (where the Commission determines it is technically and economically feasible), in combination with the blocking option described under subparagraph (A), the option of presubscribing to or blocking only specific pay-per-call services for a reasonable one-time charge.

            The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph may permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered by contract or tariff, but such costs may not be recovered from local or long-distance ratepayers. Nothing in this subsection precludes a common carrier from filing its rates and regulations regarding blocking and presubscription in its interstate tariffs.

        (6) __Verification of charitable status__ 

            A common carrier that assigns by contract or tariff a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of pay-per-call services that the carrier knows or reasonably should know is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions shall obtain from such provider proof of the tax exempt status of any person or organization for which contributions are solicited.

        (7) __Billing for 800 calls__ 

        A common carrier shall prohibit by tariff or contract the use of any 800 telephone number, or other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, in a manner that would result in—

            (B) the calling party being connected to a pay-per-call service;

            (C)

             the calling party being charged for information conveyed during the call unless—

                (ii) the information provider’s name;

                (iii) the information provider’s business address;

                (ii) the phone bill shall include, in prominent type, the following disclaimer:    “Common carriers may not disconnect local or long distance telephone service for failure to pay disputed charges for information services.”; and

                (iii) the phone bill shall clearly list the 800 number dialed.

            (C) __Use of PINs to prevent unauthorized use__ 

            A written agreement does not meet the requirements of this paragraph unless it—

                (i) includes a unique personal identification number or other subscriber-specific identifier and requires a subscriber to use this number or identifier to obtain access to the information provided and includes instructions on its use; and

                (ii) assures that any charges for services accessed by use of the subscriber’s personal identification number or subscriber-specific identifier be assessed to subscriber’s source of payment elected pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).

        (5) __Enforcement of existing regulations__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from enforcing regulations prescribed prior to October 28, 1992, in fulfilling the requirements of this section to the extent that such regulations are consistent with the provisions of this section.
