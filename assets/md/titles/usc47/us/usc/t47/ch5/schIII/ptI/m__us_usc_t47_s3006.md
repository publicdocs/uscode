## “SEC. 3006. PUBLIC SAFETY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS.

>     “(a) __Creation of Program.—__ 

>     The Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security—

>         “(1)

>          may take such administrative action as is necessary to establish and implement—

>             “(A)

>              a grant program to assist public safety agencies in the planning and coordination associated with, the acquisition of, deployment of, or training for the use of interoperable communications equipment, software and systems that—

>                 “(i) utilize reallocated public safety spectrum for radio communication;

>                 “(ii) enable interoperability with communications systems that can utilize reallocated public safety spectrum for radio communication; or

>                 “(iii) otherwise improve or advance the interoperability of public safety communications systems that utilize other public safety spectrum bands; and

>             “(B) are used to establish and implement \[sic\] a strategic technology reserve to pre-position or secure interoperable communications in advance for immediate deployment in an emergency or major disaster;

>         “(2) shall make payments of not to exceed $1,000,000,000, in the aggregate, through fiscal year 2010 from the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund established under section 309(j)(8)(E) of the Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(E)][/us/usc/t47/s309/j/8/E]) to carry out the grant program established under paragraph (1), of which at least $75,000,000, in the aggregate, shall be used for purposes described in paragraph (1)(B); and

>         “(3) shall permit any funds allocated for use under paragraph (1)(B) to be used for purposes identified under paragraph (1)(A), if the public safety agency demonstrates that it has already implemented such a strategic technology reserve or demonstrates higher priority public safety communications needs.

>     “(b) __Eligibility.—__ 

>     To be eligible for assistance under the grant program established under subparagraph (a)(1)(A), an applicant shall submit an application, at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Assistant Secretary may require, including a detailed explanation of how assistance received under the program would be used to improve communications interoperability and ensure interoperability with other public safety agencies in an emergency or a major disaster.

>     “(c) __Criteria for Strategic Technology Reserves.—__ 

>         “(1) __In general.—__ 

>         In evaluating permitted uses under subparagraph (a)(1)(B), the Assistant Secretary shall consider the continuing technological evolution of communications technologies and devices, with its implicit risk of obsolescence, and shall ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, that a substantial part of the reserve involves prenegotiated contracts and other arrangements for rapid deployment of equipment, supplies, and systems (and communications service related to such equipment, supplies, and systems), rather than the warehousing or storage of equipment and supplies currently available at the time the reserve is established.

>         “(2) __Requirements and characteristics.—__ 

>         Funds provided to meet uses described in paragraph (1) shall be used in support of reserves that—

>             “(A) are capable of re-establishing communications when existing critical infrastructure is damaged or destroyed in an emergency or a major disaster;

>             “(B) include appropriate current, widely-used equipment, such as Land Mobile Radio Systems, cellular telephones and satellite-enabled equipment (and related communications service), Cells-On-Wheels, Cells-On-Light-Trucks, or other self-contained mobile cell sites that can be towed, backup batteries, generators, fuel, and computers;

>             “(C) include equipment on hand for the Governor of each State, key emergency response officials, and appropriate State or local personnel;

>             “(D) include contracts (including prenegotiated contracts) for rapid delivery of the most current technology available from commercial sources; and

>             “(E) include arrangements for training to ensure that personnel are familiar with the operation of the equipment and devices to be delivered pursuant to such contracts.

>         “(3) __Additional characteristics.—__ 

>         Portions of the reserve may be virtual and may include items donated on an in-kind contribution basis.

>         “(4) __Allocation of funds.—__ 

>         In evaluating permitted uses under subparagraph (a)(1)(B), the Assistant Secretary shall take into account barriers to immediate deployment, including time and distance, that may slow the rapid deployment of equipment, supplies, and systems (and communications service related to such equipment, supplies, and systems) in the event of an emergency in any State.

>     “(d) __Voluntary Consensus Standards.—__ 

>     In carrying out this section, the Assistant Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall identify and, if necessary, encourage the development and implementation of, voluntary consensus standards for interoperable communications systems to the greatest extent practicable, but shall not require any such standard.

>     “(e) __Inspector General Report and Audits.—__ 

>         “(1) __Report.—__ 

>         Beginning with the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 \[Aug. 3, 2007\], the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce shall conduct an annual assessment of the management of the grant program implemented under subsection (a)(1) and transmit a report containing the findings of that assessment and any recommendations related thereto to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.

>         “(2) __Audits.—__ 

>         Beginning with the first fiscal year beginning after the date of enactment of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce shall conduct financial audits of entities receiving grants from the program implemented under subsection (a)(1), and shall ensure that, over the course of 4 years, such audits cover recipients in a representative sample of not fewer than 25 States or territories. The results of any such audits shall be made publicly available via web site, subject to redaction as the Inspector General determines necessary to protect classified and other sensitive information.

>     “(f) __Rule of Construction.—__ 

>     Nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to preclude the use of funds under this section by any public safety agency for interim- or long-term Internet Protocol-based interoperable solutions.

>     “(h)    \[(g) __\] Credit.—__ 

>         The Assistant Secretary may borrow from the Treasury beginning on October 1, 2006, such sums as may be necessary, but not to exceed $1,000,000,000, to implement this section. The Assistant Secretary shall reimburse the Treasury, without interest, as funds are deposited into the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund.

>         “(i)

>             \[(h)\] Condition of Grants.—In order to obtain a grant under the grant program, a public safety agency shall agree to provide, from non-Federal sources, not less than 20 percent of the costs of acquiring and deploying the interoperable communications systems funded under the grant program.

>         “(j)

>         \[(i)\] Definitions.—For purposes of this section:    “(1) __Public safety agency.—__ 

>             The term ‘public safety agency’ means any State, local, or tribal government entity, or nongovernmental organization authorized by such entity, whose sole or principal purpose is to protect the safety of life, health, or property.

>             “(2) __Interoperable communications systems.—__ 

>             The term ‘interoperable communications systems’ means communications systems which enable public safety agencies to share information amongst local, State, Federal, and tribal public safety agencies in the same area via voice or data signals.
