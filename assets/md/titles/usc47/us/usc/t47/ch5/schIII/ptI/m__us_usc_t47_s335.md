## § 335. Direct broadcast satellite service obligations

    (a) __Proceeding required to review DBS responsibilities__ 

        The Commission shall, within 180 days after October 5, 1992, initiate a rulemaking proceeding to impose, on providers of direct broadcast satellite service, public interest or other requirements for providing video programming. Any regulations prescribed pursuant to such rulemaking shall, at a minimum, apply the access to broadcast time requirement of [section 312(a)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s312/a/7] and the use of facilities requirements of [section 315 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s315] to providers of direct broadcast satellite service providing video programming. Such proceeding also shall examine the opportunities that the establishment of direct broadcast satellite service provides for the principle of localism under this chapter, and the methods by which such principle may be served through technological and other developments in, or regulation of, such service.

    (b) __Carriage obligations for noncommercial, educational, State public affairs, and informational programming__ 

        (1) __Channel capacity required__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall require, as a condition of any provision, initial authorization, or authorization renewal for a provider of direct broadcast satellite service providing video programming, that the provider of such service reserve a portion of its channel capacity, equal to not less than 4 percent nor more than 7 percent, exclusively for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature.

        (2) __Use of unused channel capacity__ 

            A provider of such service may utilize for any purpose any unused channel capacity required to be reserved under this subsection pending the actual use of such channel capacity for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature.

        (3) __Prices, terms, and conditions; editorial control__ 

            A provider of direct broadcast satellite service shall meet the requirements of this subsection by making channel capacity available to national educational programming suppliers, upon reasonable prices, terms, and conditions, as determined by the Commission under paragraph (4). The provider of direct broadcast satellite service shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this subsection.

        (4) __Limitations__ 

        In determining reasonable prices under paragraph (3)—

            (A) the Commission shall take into account the nonprofit character of the programming provider and any Federal funds used to support such programming;

            (B) the Commission shall not permit such prices to exceed, for any channel made available under this subsection, 50 percent of the total direct costs of making such channel available; and

            (C)

             in the calculation of total direct costs, the Commission shall exclude—
