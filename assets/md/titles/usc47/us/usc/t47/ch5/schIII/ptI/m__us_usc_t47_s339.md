## § 339. Carriage of distant television stations by satellite carriers

    (a) __Provisions relating to carriage of distant signals__ 

        (1) __Carriage permitted__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to [section 119 of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119], any satellite carrier shall be permitted to provide the signals of no more than two network stations in a single day for each television network to any household not located within the local markets of those network stations.

            (B) __Additional service__ 

                In addition to signals provided under subparagraph (A), any satellite carrier may also provide service under the statutory license of [section 122 of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s122], to the local market within which such household is located. The service provided under section 122 of such title may be in addition to the two signals provided under section 119 of such title.

        (2) __Replacement of distant signals with local signals__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (1), the following rules shall apply after December 8, 2004:

            (A) __Rules for grandfathered subscribers__ 

                (i) __For those receiving distant signals__ 

                In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station solely by reason of [section 119(e) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/e] (in this subparagraph referred to as a “distant signal”), and who, as of October 1, 2009, is receiving the distant signal of that network station, the following shall apply:

                    (I)

                     In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to the subscriber the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338], the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber—

                        (aa) if, within 60 days after receiving the notice of the satellite carrier under [section 338(h)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338/h/1], the subscriber elects to retain the distant signal; but

                        (bb) only until such time as the subscriber elects to receive such local signal.

                    (II) Notwithstanding subclause (I), the carrier may not retransmit the distant signal to any subscriber who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station solely by reason of [section 119(e) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/e], unless such carrier, within 60 days after December 8, 2004, submits to that television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(i).

                (ii) __For those not receiving distant signals__ 

                    In the case of any subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the distant signal of a network station solely by reason of [section 119(e) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/e] and who did not receive a distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network on October 1, 2009, the carrier may not provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber.

            (B) __Rules for other subscribers__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station under this section (in this subparagraph referred to as a “distant signal”), other than subscribers to whom subparagraph (A) applies, the following shall apply:

                    (I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338], the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if the subscriber’s satellite carrier, not later than March 1, 2005, submits to that television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(i).

                    (II)

                     In a case in which the satellite carrier does not make available to that subscriber, on January 1, 2005, the signal of a local network station pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338], the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if—

                        (aa) that subscriber seeks to subscribe to such distant signal before the date on which such carrier commences to carry pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] the signals of stations from the local market of such local network station; and

                        (bb) the satellite carrier, within 60 days after such date, submits to each television network the list and statement required by subparagraph (F)(ii).

                (ii) __Special circumstances__ 

                    A subscriber of a satellite carrier who was lawfully receiving the distant signal of a network station on the day before the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 may receive both such distant signal and the local signal of a network station affiliated with the same network until such subscriber chooses to no longer receive such distant signal from such carrier, whether or not such subscriber elects to subscribe to such local signal.

            (C) __Future applicability__ 

            A satellite carrier may not provide a distant signal (within the meaning of subparagraph (A) or (B)) to a person who—

                (i) is not a subscriber lawfully receiving such secondary transmission as of the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 and, at the time such person seeks to subscribe to receive such secondary transmission, resides in a local market where the satellite carrier makes available to that person the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] (and the retransmission of such signal by such carrier can reach such subscriber); or

                (ii) lawfully subscribes to and receives a distant signal on or after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, and, subsequent to such subscription, the satellite carrier makes available to that subscriber the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same network as the distant signal (and the retransmission of such signal by such carrier can reach such subscriber), unless such person subscribes to the signal of the local network station within 60 days after such signal is made available.

            (D) __Special rules for distant signals__ 

                (i) __Eligibility and signal testing__ 

                A subscriber of a satellite carrier shall be eligible to receive a distant signal of a network station affiliated with the same network under this section if, with respect to a local network station, such subscriber—

                    (I) is a subscriber whose household is not predicted by the model specified in subsection (c)(3) to receive the signal intensity required under section 73.622(e)(1) or, in the case of a low-power station or translator station transmitting an analog signal, section 73.683(a) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation;

                    (II) is determined, based on a test conducted in accordance with section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation, not to be able to receive a signal that exceeds the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) or, in the case of a low-power station or translator station transmitting an analog signal, section 73.683(a) of such title, or a successor regulation; or

                    (III) is in an unserved household, as determined under [section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/10/A].

                (ii) __Pre-enactment distant signal subscribers__ 

                    Any eligible subscriber under this subparagraph who is a lawful subscriber to such a distant signal as of the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 may continue to receive such distant signal.

                (iii) __Time-shifting prohibited__ 

                    In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to an eligible subscriber under this subparagraph the signal of a local network station pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338], the carrier may only provide the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber if, in the case of any local market in the 48 contiguous States of the United States, the distant signal is the secondary transmission of a station whose prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the prime time network programming of the affiliate of the same network in the local market.

                (iv) __Savings provision__ 

                    Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect a satellite carrier’s obligations under [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338].

            (E) __Authority to grant station-specific waivers__ 

                This paragraph shall not prohibit a retransmission of a distant signal of any distant network station to any subscriber to whom the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same network is available, if and to the extent that such local network station has affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of this paragraph to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of such distant network station to such subscriber.

            (F) __Notices to networks of distant signal subscribers__ 

                (i)

                 Within 60 days after December 8, 2004, each satellite carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this paragraph shall submit to each network—

                    (I)

                     a list, aggregated by designated market area, identifying each subscriber provided such a signal by—

                        (aa) name;

                        (bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State, and zip code); and

                        (cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and

                    (II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier’s knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) of this paragraph.

                (ii)

                 Within 60 days after the date a satellite carrier commences to carry pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] the signals of stations from a local market, such a satellite carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to a subscriber pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph shall submit to each network—

                    (I)

                     a list identifying each subscriber in that local market provided such a signal by—

                        (aa) name;

                        (bb) address (street or rural route number, city, State, and zip code); and

                        (cc) the distant network signal or signals received; and

                    (II) a statement that, to the best of the carrier’s knowledge and belief after having made diligent and good faith inquiries, the subscriber is qualified under the existing law to receive the distant network signal or signals pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph.

            (G) __Other provisions not affected__ 

                This paragraph shall not affect the eligibility of a subscriber to receive secondary transmissions under [section 340 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s340] or as an unserved household included under section 119(a)(12)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 17.

            (H) __Available defined__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, a satellite carrier makes available a local signal to a subscriber or person if the satellite carrier offers that local signal to other subscribers who reside in the same zip code as that subscriber or person.

        (3) __Penalty for violation__ 

            Any satellite carrier that knowingly and willfully provides the signals of television stations to subscribers in violation of this subsection shall be liable for a forfeiture penalty under [section 503 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s503] in the amount of $50,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection, relating to the provision of distant digital signals, shall be enforceable under the provisions of [section 340(f) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s340/f].

    (b) __Extension of network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and sports blackout to satellite retransmission__ 

        (1) __Extension of protections__ 

        Within 45 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall commence a single rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations that—

            (A) apply network nonduplication protection (47 CFR 76.92) syndicated exclusivity protection (47 CFR 76.151), and sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of nationally distributed superstations by satellite carriers to subscribers; and

            (B) to the extent technically feasible and not economically prohibitive, apply sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of network stations by satellite carriers to subscribers.

        (2) __Deadline for action__ 

            The Commission shall complete all actions necessary to prescribe regulations required by this section so that the regulations shall become effective within 1 year after November 29, 1999.

    (c) __Eligibility for retransmission__ 

        (1) __Study of digital strength testing procedures__ 

            (A) __Study required__ 

                Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry regarding whether, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under [section 119(d)(10) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/10], the digital signal strength standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or the testing procedures in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, such statutes or regulations should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to consumers.

            (B) __Study considerations__ 

            In conducting the study under this paragraph, the Commission shall consider whether—

                (i) to account for the fact that an antenna can be mounted on a roof or placed in a home and can be fixed or capable of rotating;

                (ii) section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, should be amended to create different procedures for determining if the requisite digital signal strength is present than for determining if the requisite analog signal strength is present;

                (iii) a standard should be used other than the presence of a signal of a certain strength to ensure that a household can receive a high-quality picture using antennas of reasonable cost and ease of installation;

                (iv) to develop a predictive methodology for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under [section 119(d)(10) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/10];

                (v) there is a wide variation in the ability of reasonably priced consumer digital television sets to receive over-the-air signals, such that at a given signal strength some may be able to display high-quality pictures while others cannot, whether such variation is related to the price of the television set, and whether such variation should be factored into setting a standard for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal; and

                (vi) to account for factors such as building loss, external interference sources, or undesired signals from both digital television and analog television stations using either the same or adjacent channels in nearby markets, foliage, and man-made clutter.

            (C) __Report__ 

            Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing—

                (i) the results of the study under this paragraph; and

                (ii) recommendations, if any, as to what changes should be made to Federal statutes or regulations.

        (2) __Waivers__ 

            A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under [section 119 of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119] may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such subscriber’s satellite carrier, to the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber’s request for a waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under [section 119(d)(10)(B) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/10/B], if such station agrees to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to accept or reject a subscriber’s request for a waiver within the 30-day period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.

        (3) __Establishment of improved predictive model and on-location testing required__ 

            (A) __Predictive model__ 

                Within 270 days after the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, the Commission shall develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations, through the use of an antenna, to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation, including to account for the continuing operation of translator stations and low power television stations. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Commission in CS Docket No. 98–201, as previously revised with respect to analog signals, and as recommended by the Commission with respect to digital signals in its Report to Congress in ET Docket No. 05–182, FCC 05–199 (released December 9, 2005). The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.

            (B) __On-location testing__ 

                The Commission shall issue an order completing its rulemaking proceeding in ET Docket No. 06–94 within 270 days after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010. In conducting such rulemaking, the Commission shall seek ways to minimize consumer burdens associated with on-location testing.

        (4) __Objective verification__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If a subscriber’s request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber’s satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber’s inability to receive a signal of the signal intensity referenced in clause (i) of subsection (a)(2)(D), the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct the test referenced in such clause. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such clause demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the requisite signal intensity standard in such clause, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under [section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/10/A].

            (B) __Designation of tester and allocation of costs__ 

                If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station’s signal meets or exceeds such requisite signal intensity standard, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.

            (C) __Avoidance of undue burden__ 

                Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.

            (D) __Reduction of verification burdens__ 

                Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] from such carrier.

            (E) __Exception__ 

                A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a signal.

        (5) __Definition__ 

            Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4), for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term “satellite carrier” includes a distributor (as defined in [section 119(d)(1) of title 17][/us/usc/t17/s119/d/1]), but only if the satellite distributor’s relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection, service activation, and service deactivation.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For the purposes of this section:
