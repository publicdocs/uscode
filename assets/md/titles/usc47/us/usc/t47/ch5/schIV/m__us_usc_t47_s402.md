## § 402. Judicial review of Commission’s orders and decisions

    (a) __Procedure__ 

        Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28.

    (b) __Right to appeal__ 

    Appeals may be taken from decisions and orders of the Commission to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in any of the following cases:

        (1) By any applicant for a construction permit or station license, whose application is denied by the Commission.

        (2) By any applicant for the renewal or modification of any such instrument of authorization whose application is denied by the Commission.

        (3) By any party to an application for authority to transfer, assign, or dispose of any such instrument of authorization, or any rights thereunder, whose application is denied by the Commission.

        (4) By any applicant for the permit required by [section 325 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s325] whose application has been denied by the Commission, or by any permittee under said section whose permit has been revoked by the Commission.

        (5) By the holder of any construction permit or station license which has been modified or revoked by the Commission.

        (6) By any other person who is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any order of the Commission granting or denying any application described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (9) of this subsection.

        (7) By any person upon whom an order to cease and desist has been served under [section 312 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s312].

        (8) By any radio operator whose license has been suspended by the Commission.

        (9) By any applicant for authority to provide interLATA services under [section 271 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s271] whose application is denied by the Commission.

        (10) By any person who is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by a determination made by the Commission under [section 618(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s618/a/3].

    (c) __Filing notice of appeal; contents; jurisdiction; temporary orders__ 

        Such appeal shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is given of the decision or order complained of. Such notice of appeal shall contain a concise statement of the nature of the proceedings as to which the appeal is taken; a concise statement of the reasons on which the appellant intends to rely, separately stated and numbered; and proof of service of a true copy of said notice and statement upon the Commission. Upon filing of such notice, the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the questions determined therein and shall have power, by order, directed to the Commission or any other party to the appeal, to grant such temporary relief as it may deem just and proper. Orders granting temporary relief may be either affirmative or negative in their scope and application so as to permit either the maintenance of the status quo in the matter in which the appeal is taken or the restoration of a position or status terminated or adversely affected by the order appealed from and shall, unless otherwise ordered by the court, be effective pending hearing and determination of said appeal and compliance by the Commission with the final judgment of the court rendered in said appeal.

    (d) __Notice to interested parties; filing of record__ 

        Upon the filing of any such notice of appeal the appellant shall, not later than five days after the filing of such notice, notify each person shown by the records of the Commission to be interested in said appeal of the filing and pendency of the same. The Commission shall file with the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112].

    (e) __Intervention__ 

        Within thirty days after the filing of any such appeal any interested person may intervene and participate in the proceedings had upon said appeal by filing with the court a notice of intention to intervene and a verified statement showing the nature of the interest of such party, together with proof of service of true copies of said notice and statement, both upon appellant and upon the Commission. Any person who would be aggrieved or whose interest would be adversely affected by a reversal or modification of the order of the Commission complained of shall be considered an interested party.

    (f) __Records and briefs__ 

        The record and briefs upon which any such appeal shall be heard and determined by the court shall contain such information and material, and shall be prepared within such time and in such manner as the court may by rule prescribe.

    (g) __Time of hearing; procedure__ 

        The court shall hear and determine the appeal upon the record before it in the manner prescribed by [section 706 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s706].

    (h) __Remand__ 

        In the event that the court shall render a decision and enter an order reversing the order of the Commission, it shall remand the case to the Commission to carry out the judgment of the court and it shall be the duty of the Commission, in the absence of the proceedings to review such judgment, to forthwith give effect thereto, and unless otherwise ordered by the court, to do so upon the basis of the proceedings already had and the record upon which said appeal was heard and determined.

    (i) __Judgment for costs__ 

        The court may, in its discretion, enter judgment for costs in favor of or against an appellant, or other interested parties intervening in said appeal, but not against the Commission, depending upon the nature of the issues involved upon said appeal and the outcome thereof.

    (j) __Finality of decision; review by Supreme Court__ 

        The court’s judgment shall be final, subject, however, to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari on petition therefor under [section 1254 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s1254], by the appellant, by the Commission, or by any interested party intervening in the appeal, or by certification by the court pursuant to the provisions of that section.
