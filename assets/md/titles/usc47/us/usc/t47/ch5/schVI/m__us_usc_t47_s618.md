## § 618. Enforcement and recordkeeping obligations

    (a) __Complaint and enforcement procedures__ 

    Within one year after October 8, 2010, the Commission shall establish regulations that facilitate the filing of formal and informal complaints that allege a violation of section 255, 617, or 619 of this title, establish procedures for enforcement actions by the Commission with respect to such violations, and implement the recordkeeping obligations of paragraph (5) for manufacturers and providers subject to such sections. Such regulations shall include the following provisions:

        (1) __No fee__ 

            The Commission shall not charge any fee to an individual who files a complaint alleging a violation of section 255, 617, or 619 of this title.

        (2) __Receipt of complaints__ 

            The Commission shall establish separate and identifiable electronic, telephonic, and physical receptacles for the receipt of complaints filed under section 255, 617, or 619 of this title.

        (3) __Complaints to the Commission__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any person alleging a violation of section 255, 617, or 619 of this title by a manufacturer of equipment or provider of service subject to such sections may file a formal or informal complaint with the Commission.

            (B) __Investigation of informal complaint__ 

            The Commission shall investigate the allegations in an informal complaint and, within 180 days after the date on which such complaint was filed with the Commission, issue an order concluding the investigation, unless such complaint is resolved before such time. The order shall include a determination whether any violation occurred.

                (i) If the Commission determines that a violation has occurred, the Commission may, in the order issued under this subparagraph or in a subsequent order, direct the manufacturer or service provider to bring the service, or in the case of a manufacturer, the next generation of the equipment or device, into compliance with requirements of those sections within a reasonable time established by the Commission in its order.

                (ii)  __No violation__  __.—__ 

                If a determination is made that a violation has not occurred, the Commission shall provide the basis for such determination.

            (C) __Consolidation of complaints__ 

                The Commission may consolidate for investigation and resolution complaints alleging substantially the same violation.

        (4) __Opportunity to respond__ 

            Before the Commission makes a determination pursuant to paragraph (3), the party that is the subject of the complaint shall have a reasonable opportunity to respond to such complaint, and may include in such response any factors that are relevant to such determination. Before issuing a final order under paragraph (3)(B)(i), the Commission shall provide such party a reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed remedial action.

        (5) __Recordkeeping__ 

            (A)

             Beginning one year after the effective date of regulations promulgated pursuant to [section 617(e) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s617/e], each manufacturer and provider subject to sections 255, 617, and 619 of this title shall maintain, in the ordinary course of business and for a reasonable period, records of the efforts taken by such manufacturer or provider to implement sections 255, 617, and 619 of this title, including the following:

                (i) Information about the manufacturer’s or provider’s efforts to consult with individuals with disabilities.

                (ii) Descriptions of the accessibility features of its products and services.

            (B) An officer of a manufacturer or provider shall submit to the Commission an annual certification that records are being kept in accordance with subparagraph (A).

            (C) After the filing of a formal or informal complaint against a manufacturer or provider, the Commission may request, and shall keep confidential, a copy of the records maintained by such manufacturer or provider pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that are directly relevant to the equipment or service that is the subject of such complaint.

        (6) __Failure to act__ 

            If the Commission fails to carry out any of its responsibilities to act upon a complaint in the manner prescribed in paragraph (3), the person that filed such complaint may bring an action in the nature of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to compel the Commission to carry out any such responsibility.

Nothing in this paragraph affects or limits any action for mandamus under paragraph (6) or any appeal pursuant to [section 402(b)(10) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s402/b/10].

        (8) __Private resolutions of complaints__ 

            Nothing in the Commission’s rules or this chapter shall be construed to preclude a person who files a complaint and a manufacturer or provider from resolving a formal or informal complaint prior to the Commission’s final determination in a complaint proceeding. In the event of such a resolution, the parties shall jointly request dismissal of the complaint and the Commission shall grant such request.

    (b) __Reports to Congress__ 

        (1) __In general__
