        (2) not subsidize its alarm monitoring services either directly or indirectly from telephone exchange service operations.

    (c) __Expedited consideration of complaints__ 

        The Commission shall establish procedures for the receipt and review of complaints concerning violations of subsection (b) of this section or the regulations thereunder that result in material financial harm to a provider of alarm monitoring service. Such procedures shall ensure that the Commission will make a final determination with respect to any such complaint within 120 days after receipt of the complaint. If the complaint contains an appropriate showing that the alleged violation occurred, as determined by the Commission in accordance with such regulations, the Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of the complaint, order the incumbent local exchange carrier (as defined in [section 251(h) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s251/h]) and its affiliates to cease engaging in such violation pending such final determination.

    (d) __Use of data__

        (1) to receive signals from other devices located at or about such premises regarding a possible threat at such premises to life, safety, or property, from burglary, fire, vandalism, bodily injury, or other emergency, and

        (2) to transmit a signal regarding such threat by means of transmission facilities of a local exchange carrier or one of its affiliates to a remote monitoring center to alert a person at such center of the need to inform the customer or another person or police, fire, rescue, security, or public safety personnel of such threat,
