## § 230. Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material

    (a) __Findings__ 

    The Congress finds the following:

        (1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and other interactive computer services available to individual Americans represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of educational and informational resources to our citizens.

        (2) These services offer users a great degree of control over the information that they receive, as well as the potential for even greater control in the future as technology develops.

        (3) The Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.

        (4) The Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.

        (5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.

    (b) __Policy__ 

    It is the policy of the United States—

        (1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media;

        (2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation;

        (3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and other interactive computer services;

        (4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children’s access to objectionable or inappropriate online material; and

        (5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of computer.

    (c) __Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material__ 

        (1) __Treatment of publisher or speaker__ 

            No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

        (2) __Civil liability__ 

        No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—

            (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or

            (B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1). <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “subparagraph (A).” </sup></sup> 

    (d) __Obligations of interactive computer service__ 

        A provider of interactive computer service shall, at the time of entering an agreement with a customer for the provision of interactive computer service and in a manner deemed appropriate by the provider, notify such customer that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist the customer in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Such notice shall identify, or provide the customer with access to information identifying, current providers of such protections.

    (e) __Effect on other laws__ 

        (1) __No effect on criminal law__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the enforcement of section 223 or 231 of this title, chapter 71 (relating to obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of children) of title 18, or any other Federal criminal statute.

        (2) __No effect on intellectual property law__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property.

        (3) __State law__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State from enforcing any State law that is consistent with this section. No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.

        (4) __No effect on communications privacy law__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the application of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 or any of the amendments made by such Act, or any similar State law.
