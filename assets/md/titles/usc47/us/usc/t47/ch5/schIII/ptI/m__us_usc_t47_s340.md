## § 340. Significantly viewed signals permitted to be carried

    (a) __Significantly viewed stations__ 

    In addition to the broadcast signals that subscribers may receive under section  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “sections”. </sup></sup>  338 and 339 of this title, a satellite carrier is also authorized to retransmit to a subscriber located in a community the signal of any station located outside the local market in which such subscriber is located, to the extent such signal—

        (1) has, before December 8, 2004, been determined by the Federal Communications Commission to be a signal a cable operator may carry as significantly viewed in such community, except to the extent that such signal is prevented from being carried by a cable system in such community under the Commission’s network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; or

        (2) is, after December 8, 2004, determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed in such community in accordance with the same standards and procedures concerning shares of viewing hours and audience surveys as are applicable under the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Commission to determining with respect to a cable system whether signals are significantly viewed in a community.

    (b) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __Service limited to subscribers taking local-into-local service__ 

            This section shall apply only to retransmissions to subscribers of a satellite carrier who receive retransmissions of a signal from that satellite carrier pursuant to [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338].

        (2) __Service limitations__ 

            A satellite carrier may retransmit to a subscriber in high definition format the signal of a station determined by the Commission to be significantly viewed under subsection (a) only if such carrier also retransmits in high definition format the signal of a station located in the local market of such subscriber and affiliated with the same network whenever such format is available from such station.

        (3) __Limitation not applicable where no network affiliates__ 

            The limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission under this section to a subscriber located in a local market in which there are no network stations affiliated with the same television network as the station whose signal is being retransmitted pursuant to this section.

        (4) __Authority to grant station-specific waivers__ 

            Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prohibit a retransmission of a network station to a subscriber if and to the extent that the network station in the local market in which the subscriber is located, and that is affiliated with the same television network, has privately negotiated and affirmatively granted a waiver from the requirements of paragraph  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “paragraphs”. </sup></sup>  (1) and (2) to such satellite carrier with respect to retransmission of the significantly viewed station to such subscriber.

    (c) __Publication and modifications of lists; regulations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Commission shall—

            (A)

             within 60 days after December 8, 2004—

                (i) publish a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a)(1) of this section and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and

                (ii) commence a rulemaking proceeding to implement this section by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking;

            (B) adopt rules pursuant to such rulemaking within 1 year after December 8, 2004.

        (2) __Public availability of list__ 

            The Commission shall make readily available to the public in electronic form, on the Internet website of the Commission or other comparable facility, a list of the stations that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a) of this section and the communities in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission. The Commission shall update such list within 10 business days after the date on which the Commission issues an order making any modification of such stations and communities.

        (3) __Modifications__ 

        In addition to cable operators and television broadcast station licensees, the Commission shall permit a satellite carrier to petition for decisions and orders—

            (A) by which stations may be added to those that are eligible for retransmission under subsection (a) of this section, and by which communities may be added in which such stations are eligible for such retransmission; and

            (B) by which network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations are applied to the retransmission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.

    (d) __Effect on other obligations and rights__ 

        (1) __No effect on carriage obligations__ 

            Carriage of a signal under this section is not mandatory, and any right of a station licensee to have the signal of such station carried under [section 338 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s338] is not affected by the eligibility of such station to be carried under this section.

        (2) __Retransmission consent rights not affected__ 

            The eligibility of the signal of a station to be carried under this section does not affect any right of the licensee of such station to grant (or withhold) retransmission consent under [section 325(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s325/b/1].

    (e) __Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity__ 

        (1) __Not applicable except as provided by commission regulations__ 

            Signals eligible to be carried under this section are not subject to the Commission’s regulations concerning network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity unless, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Commission, the Commission determines to permit network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity to apply within the appropriate zone of protection.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            Nothing in this subsection or Commission regulations shall permit the application of network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations to the retransmission of distant signals of network stations that are carried by a satellite carrier pursuant to a statutory license under section 119(a)(2)(A) or (B) of title 17, with respect to persons who reside in unserved households, under  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by “section”. </sup></sup>  119(a)(4)(A), <sup>\[4\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 4 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  or under section 119(a)(12), <sup>\[4\]</sup>  of such title.
