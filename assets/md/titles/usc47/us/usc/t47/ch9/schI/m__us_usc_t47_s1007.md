    (a) __Grounds for issuance__ 

    A court shall issue an order enforcing this subchapter under [section 2522 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s2522] only if the court finds that—

        (2) compliance with the requirements of this subchapter is reasonably achievable through the application of available technology to the equipment, facility, or service at issue or would have been reasonably achievable if timely action had been taken.

    (b) __Time for compliance__ 

        Upon issuing an order enforcing this subchapter, the court shall specify a reasonable time and conditions for complying with its order, considering the good faith efforts to comply in a timely manner, any effect on the carrier’s, manufacturer’s, or service provider’s ability to continue to do business, the degree of culpability or delay in undertaking efforts to comply, and such other matters as justice may require.

    (c) __Limitations__ 

    An order enforcing this subchapter may not—

        (1) require a telecommunications carrier to meet the Government’s  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

Probably should be “requirements”. </sup></sup>  of [section 1002 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1002] if the Commission has determined (pursuant to [section 1008(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1008/b/1]) that compliance is not reasonably achievable, unless the Attorney General has agreed (pursuant to [section 1008(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1008/b/2]) to pay the costs described in [section 1008(b)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1008/b/2/A]; or

        (3)

         require a telecommunications carrier to modify, for the purpose of complying with the assistance capability requirements of [section 1002 of this title][/us/usc/t47/s1002], any equipment, facility, or service deployed on or before January 1, 1995, unless—

            (A) the Attorney General has agreed to pay the telecommunications carrier for all reasonable costs directly associated with modifications necessary to bring the equipment, facility, or service into compliance with those requirements; or
