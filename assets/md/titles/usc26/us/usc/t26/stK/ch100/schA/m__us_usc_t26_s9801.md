## § 9801. Increased portability through limitation on preexisting condition exclusions

    (a) __Limitation on preexisting condition exclusion period; crediting for periods of previous coverage__ 

    Subject to subsection (d), a group health plan may, with respect to a participant or beneficiary, impose a preexisting condition exclusion only if—

        (1) such exclusion relates to a condition (whether physical or mental), regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period ending on the enrollment date;

        (2) such exclusion extends for a period of not more than 12 months (or 18 months in the case of a late enrollee) after the enrollment date; and

        (3) the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion is reduced by the length of the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any) applicable to the participant or beneficiary as of the enrollment date.

    (b) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Preexisting condition exclusion__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “preexisting condition exclusion” means, with respect to coverage, a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to a condition based on the fact that the condition was present before the date of enrollment for such coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before such date.

            (B) __Treatment of genetic information__ 

                For purposes of this section, genetic information shall not be treated as a condition described in subsection (a)(1) in the absence of a diagnosis of the condition related to such information.

        (2) __Enrollment date__ 

            The term “enrollment date” means, with respect to an individual covered under a group health plan, the date of enrollment of the individual in the plan or, if earlier, the first day of the waiting period for such enrollment.

        (3) __Late enrollee__ 

        The term “late enrollee” means, with respect to coverage under a group health plan, a participant or beneficiary who enrolls under the plan other than during—

            (A) the first period in which the individual is eligible to enroll under the plan, or

            (B) a special enrollment period under subsection (f).

        (4) __Waiting period__ 

            The term “waiting period” means, with respect to a group health plan and an individual who is a potential participant or beneficiary in the plan, the period that must pass with respect to the individual before the individual is eligible to be covered for benefits under the terms of the plan.

    (c) __Rules relating to crediting previous coverage__ 

        (1) __Creditable coverage defined__

            Such term does not include coverage consisting solely of coverage of excepted benefits (as defined in section 9832(c)).

        (2) __Not counting periods before significant breaks in coverage__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A period of creditable coverage shall not be counted, with respect to enrollment of an individual under a group health plan, if, after such period and before the enrollment date, there was a 63-day period during all of which the individual was not covered under any creditable coverage.

            (B) __Waiting period not treated as a break in coverage__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A) and subsection (d)(4), any period that an individual is in a waiting period for any coverage under a group health plan or is in an affiliation period shall not be taken into account in determining the continuous period under subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Affiliation period__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    For purposes of this section, the term “affiliation period” means a period which, under the terms of the health insurance coverage offered by the health maintenance organization, must expire before the health insurance coverage becomes effective. During such an affiliation period, the organization is not required to provide health care services or benefits and no premium shall be charged to the participant or beneficiary.

                (ii) __Beginning__ 

                    Such period shall begin on the enrollment date.

                (iii) __Runs concurrently with waiting periods__

            In the case of plan years beginning before January 1, 2014—

                (i) __TAA pre-certification period rule__ 

                    In the case of a TAA-eligible individual, the period beginning on the date the individual has a TAA-related loss of coverage and ending on the date which is 7 days after the date of the issuance by the Secretary (or by any person or entity designated by the Secretary) of a qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility certificate for such individual for purposes of section 7527 shall not be taken into account in determining the continuous period under subparagraph (A).

                (ii) __Definitions__ 

                    The terms “TAA-eligible individual” and “TAA-related loss of coverage” have the meanings given such terms in section 4980B(f)(5)(C)(iv).

        (3) __Method of crediting coverage__ 

            (A) __Standard method__ 

                Except as otherwise provided under subparagraph (B), for purposes of applying subsection (a)(3), a group health plan shall count a period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits for which coverage is offered during the period.

            (B) __Election of alternative method__ 

                A group health plan may elect to apply subsection (a)(3) based on coverage of any benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in regulations rather than as provided under subparagraph (A). Such election shall be made on a uniform basis for all participants and beneficiaries. Under such election a group health plan shall count a period of creditable coverage with respect to any class or category of benefits if any level of benefits is covered within such class or category.

            In the case of an election with respect to a group health plan under subparagraph (B), the plan shall—

                (i) prominently state in any disclosure statements concerning the plan, and state to each enrollee at the time of enrollment under the plan, that the plan has made such election, and

                (ii) include in such statements a description of the effect of this election.

        (4) __Establishment of period__ 

            Periods of creditable coverage with respect to an individual shall be established through presentation of certifications described in subsection (e) or in such other manner as may be specified in regulations.

    (d) __Exceptions__ 

        (1) __Exclusion not applicable to certain newborns__

        (2) __Exclusion not applicable to certain adopted children__ 

            Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage. The previous sentence shall not apply to coverage before the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.

        (3) __Exclusion not applicable to pregnancy__ 

            For purposes of this section, a group health plan may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy as a preexisting condition.

        (4) __Loss if break in coverage__

                (i) at the time an individual ceases to be covered under the plan or otherwise becomes covered under a COBRA continuation provision,

                (ii) in the case of an individual becoming covered under such a provision, at the time the individual ceases to be covered under such provision, and

                (iii) on the request on behalf of an individual made not later than 24 months after the date of cessation of the coverage described in clause (i) or (ii), whichever is later.

                The certification under clause (i) may be provided, to the extent practicable, at a time consistent with notices required under any applicable COBRA continuation provision.

            (B) __Certification__ 

            The certification described in this subparagraph is a written certification of—

                (i) the period of creditable coverage of the individual under such plan and the coverage under such COBRA continuation provision, and

                (ii) the waiting period (if any) (and affiliation period, if applicable) imposed with respect to the individual for any coverage under such plan.

            (C) __Issuer compliance__ 

                To the extent that medical care under a group health plan consists of health insurance coverage offered in connection with the plan, the plan is deemed to have satisfied the certification requirement under this paragraph if the issuer provides for such certification in accordance with this paragraph.

        (2) __Disclosure of information on previous benefits__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of an election described in subsection (c)(3)(B) by a group health plan, if the plan enrolls an individual for coverage under the plan and the individual provides a certification of coverage of the individual under paragraph (1)—

        (3) __Regulations__ 

            The Secretary shall establish rules to prevent an entity’s failure to provide information under paragraph (1) or (2) with respect to previous coverage of an individual from adversely affecting any subsequent coverage of the individual under another group health plan or health insurance coverage.

    (f) __Special enrollment periods__ 

        (1) __Individuals losing other coverage__ 

        A group health plan shall permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if each of the following conditions is met:

            (A) The employee or dependent was covered under a group health plan or had health insurance coverage at the time coverage was previously offered to the employee or individual.

            (B) The employee stated in writing at such time that coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage was the reason for declining enrollment, but only if the plan sponsor (or the health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with the plan) required such a statement at such time and provided the employee with notice of such requirement (and the consequences of such requirement) at such time.

            (C)

             The employee’s or dependent’s coverage described in subparagraph (A)—

                (i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or

                (ii) was not under such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated.

            (D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).

        (2) __For dependent beneficiaries__

            If—

                (i) a group health plan makes coverage available with respect to a dependent of an individual,

                (ii) the individual is a participant under the plan (or has met any waiting period applicable to becoming a participant under the plan and is eligible to be enrolled under the plan but for a failure to enroll during a previous enrollment period), and

                (iii) a person becomes such a dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption,

                the group health plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period described in subparagraph (B) during which the person (or, if not otherwise enrolled, the individual) may be enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual, and in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled as a dependent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage.

            (B) __Dependent special enrollment period__ 

            The dependent special enrollment period under this subparagraph shall be a period of not less than 30 days and shall begin on the later of—

                (i) the date dependent coverage is made available, or

                (ii) the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption (as the case may be) described in subparagraph (A)(iii).

            (C) __No waiting period__ 

            If an individual seeks coverage of a dependent during the first 30 days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective—

                (ii) in the case of a dependent’s birth, as of the date of such birth; or

        (3) __Special rules relating to Medicaid and CHIP__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            A group health plan shall permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if either of the following conditions is met:

                (i) __Termination of Medicaid or CHIP coverage__ 

                    The employee or dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act or under a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act and coverage of the employee or dependent under such a plan is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for such coverage and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after the date of termination of such coverage.

                (ii) __Eligibility for employment assistance under Medicaid or CHIP__ 

                    The employee or dependent becomes eligible for assistance, with respect to coverage under the group health plan under such Medicaid plan or State child health plan (including under any waiver or demonstration project conducted under or in relation to such a plan), if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after the date the employee or dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.

            (B) __Employee outreach and disclosure__ 

                (i) __Outreach to employees regarding availability of Medicaid and CHIP coverage__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Each employer that maintains a group health plan in a State that provides medical assistance under a State Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act, or child health assistance under a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act, in the form of premium assistance for the purchase of coverage under a group health plan, shall provide to each employee a written notice informing the employee of potential opportunities then currently available in the State in which the employee resides for premium assistance under such plans for health coverage of the employee or the employee’s dependents.

                (ii) __Disclosure about group health plan benefits to States for Medicaid and CHIP eligible individuals__ 

                    In the case of a participant or beneficiary of a group health plan who is covered under a Medicaid plan of a State under title XIX of the Social Security Act or under a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act, the plan administrator of the group health plan shall disclose to the State, upon request, information about the benefits available under the group health plan in sufficient specificity, as determined under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services in consultation with the Secretary that require use of the model coverage coordination disclosure form developed under section 311(b)(1)(C) of the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, so as to permit the State to make a determination (under paragraph (2)(B), (3), or (10) of section 2105(c) of the Social Security Act or otherwise) concerning the cost-effectiveness of the State providing medical or child health assistance through premium assistance for the purchase of coverage under such group health plan and in order for the State to provide supplemental benefits required under paragraph (10)(E) of such section or other authority.
