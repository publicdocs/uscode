    (c) __Information base for Secretary’s notices, etc.__ 

    For purposes of this subchapter—

            Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Secretary shall use the names, addresses, and profits interests shown on the partnership return.

        (2) __Use of additional information__ 

            The Secretary shall use additional information furnished to him by the tax matters partner or any other person in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

        (3) __Special rule with respect to indirect partners__

            (B) __Special rules for partnerships with more than 100 partners__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), any partner described in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) shall be treated as entitled to notice specified in subsection (a). The Secretary may provide such notice—

                (i) except as provided in clause (ii), by mailing notice to the tax matters partner, or

                (ii) in the case of a member of a notice group which qualified under paragraph (2) of subsection (b), by mailing notice to the partner designated for such purpose by the group.

        (2) __Proceedings finished__ 

        In any case to which this subsection applies, if at the time the Secretary mails the partner notice of the proceeding—

            (B) to have the partnership items of the partner for the partnership taxable year to which the proceeding relates treated as nonpartnership items.

        If the Secretary mails a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment for a partnership taxable year with respect to a partner, the Secretary may not mail another such notice to such partner with respect to the same taxable year of the same partnership in the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact.
