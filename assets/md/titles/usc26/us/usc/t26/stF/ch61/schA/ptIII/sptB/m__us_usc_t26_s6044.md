        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this section, every cooperative to which part I of subchapter T of chapter 1 applies, which makes payments of amounts described in subsection (b) aggregating $10 or more to any person during any calendar year, shall make a return according to the forms of regulations prescribed by the Secretary, setting forth the aggregate amount of such payments and the name and address of the person to whom paid.

        (2) __Returns required by the Secretary__ 

            Every such cooperative which makes payments of amounts described in subsection (b) aggregating less than $10 to any person during any calendar year shall, when required by the Secretary, make a return setting forth the aggregate amount of such payments and the name and address of the person to whom paid.

    (b) __Amounts subject to reporting__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amounts subject to reporting under subsection (a) are—

            (A) the amount of any patronage dividend (as defined in section 1388(a)) which is paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation (as defined in section 1388(c)), or other property (except nonqualified written notices of allocation as defined in section 1388(d)),

            (B) any amount described in section 1382(c)(2)(A) (relating to certain nonpatronage distributions) which is paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (except nonqualified written notices of allocation) by an organization exempt from tax under section 521 (relating to exemption of farmers’ cooperatives from tax),

            (C) any amount described in section 1382(b)(2) (relating to redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation) and, in the case of an organization described in section 1381(a)(1), any amount described in section 1382(c)(2)(B) (relating to redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation paid with respect to earnings derived from sources other than patronage), and

            (B) to a foreign corporation, a nonresident alien, or a partnership not engaged in trade or business in the United States and composed in whole or in part of nonresident aliens.

    (c) __Exemption for certain consumer cooperatives__ 

        A cooperative which the Secretary determines is primarily engaged in selling at retail goods or services of a type that are generally for personal, living, or family use shall, upon application to the Secretary, be granted exemption from the reporting requirements imposed by subsection (a). Application for exemption under this subsection shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (d) __Determination of amount paid__ 

    For purposes of this section, in determining the amount of any payment—

        (1) property (other than a qualified written notice of allocation or a qualified per-unit retain certificate) shall be taken into account at its fair market value, and

        (2) a qualified written notice of allocation or a qualified per-unit retain certificate shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount.

    (e) __Statements to be furnished to persons with respect to whom information is required__ 

    Every cooperative required to make a return under subsection (a) shall furnish to each person whose name is required to be set forth in such return a written statement showing—

        (1) the name, address, and phone number of the information contact of the cooperative required to make such return, and

        (2) the aggregate amount of payments to the person required to be shown on the return.
