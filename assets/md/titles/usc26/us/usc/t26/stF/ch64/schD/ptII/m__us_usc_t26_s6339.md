    In all cases of sale pursuant to section 6335 of property (other than real property), the certificate of such sale—

            Shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold; and

        (3) __As authority for transfer of corporate stock__ 

            If such property consists of stocks, shall be notice, when received, to any corporation, company, or association of such transfer, and shall be authority to such corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on its books and records in the same manner as if the stocks were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, whether canceled or not; and

        (4) __As receipts__ 

            If the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt, shall be a good and valid receipt to the person holding the same, as against any person holding or claiming to hold possession of such securities or other evidences of debt; and

        (5) __As authority for transfer of title to motor vehicle__ 

            If such property consists of a motor vehicle, shall be notice, when received, to any public official charged with the registration of title to motor vehicles, of such transfer and shall be authority to such official to record the transfer on his books and records in the same manner as if the certificate of title to such motor vehicle were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, whether canceled or not.

    (b) __Deed of real property__ 

    In the case of the sale of real property pursuant to section 6335—

        (1) __Deed as evidence__ 

            The deed of sale given pursuant to section 6338 shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated; and

        (2) __Deed as conveyance of title__ 

            If the proceedings of the Secretary as set forth have been substantially in accordance with the provisions of law, such deed shall be considered and operate as a conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the United States attached thereto.

    (c) __Effect of junior encumbrances__ 

        A certificate of sale of personal property given or a deed to real property executed pursuant to section 6338 shall discharge such property from all liens, encumbrances, and titles over which the lien of the United States with respect to which the levy was made had priority.
