## § 6031. Return of partnership income

    (a) __General rule__ 

        Every partnership (as defined in section 761(a)) shall make a return for each taxable year, stating specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions allowable by subtitle A, and such other information, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of subtitle A as the Secretary may by forms and regulations prescribe, and shall include in the return the names and addresses of the individuals who would be entitled to share in the taxable income if distributed and the amount of the distributive share of each individual.

    (b) __Copies to partners__ 

        Each partnership required to file a return under subsection (a) for any partnership taxable year shall (on or before the day on which the return for such taxable year was required to be filed) furnish to each person who is a partner or who holds an interest in such partnership as a nominee for another person at any time during such taxable year a copy of such information required to be shown on such return as may be required by regulations. In the case of an electing large partnership (as defined in section 775), such information shall be furnished on or before the first March 15 following the close of such taxable year.

    (c) __Nominee reporting__ 

    Any person who holds an interest in a partnership as a nominee for another person—

        (1) shall furnish to the partnership, in the manner prescribed by the Secretary, the name and address of such other person, and any other information for such taxable year as the Secretary may by form and regulation prescribe, and

        (2) shall furnish in the manner prescribed by the Secretary such other person the information provided by such partnership under subsection (b).

    (d) __Separate statement of items of unrelated business taxable income__ 

        In the case of any partnership regularly carrying on a trade or business (within the meaning of section 512(c)(1)), the information required under subsection (b) to be furnished to its partners shall include such information as is necessary to enable each partner to compute its distributive share of partnership income or loss from such trade or business in accordance with section 512(a)(1), but without regard to the modifications described in paragraphs (8) through (15) of section 512(b).

    (e) __Foreign partnerships__ 

        (1) __Exception for foreign partnership__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), the preceding provisions of this section shall not apply to a foreign partnership.

        (2) __Certain foreign partnerships required to file return__ 

        Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, this section shall apply to a foreign partnership for any taxable year if for such year, such partnership has—

            (A) gross income derived from sources within the United States, or

            (B) gross income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

            The Secretary may provide simplified filing procedures for foreign partnerships to which this section applies.

    (f) __Electing investment partnerships__ 

        In the case of any electing investment partnership (as defined in section 743(e)(6)), the information required under subsection (b) to be furnished to any partner to whom section 743(e)(2) applies shall include such information as is necessary to enable the partner to compute the amount of losses disallowed under section 743(e).
