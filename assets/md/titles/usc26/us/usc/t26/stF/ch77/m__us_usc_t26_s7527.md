    (d) __Qualified health insurance costs eligibility certificate__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified health insurance costs eligibility certificate” means any written statement that an individual is an eligible individual (as defined in section 35(c)) if such statement provides such information as the Secretary may require for purposes of this section and—

            (A) in the case of an eligible TAA recipient (as defined in section 35(c)(2)) or an eligible alternative TAA recipient (as defined in section 35(c)(3)), is certified by the Secretary of Labor (or by any other person or entity designated by the Secretary), or

        (2) __Inclusion of certain information__ 

        In the case of any statement described in paragraph (1), such statement shall not be treated as a qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility certificate unless such statement includes—

            (B) a list of the coverage options that are treated as qualified health insurance (as so defined) by the State in which the individual resides, and
