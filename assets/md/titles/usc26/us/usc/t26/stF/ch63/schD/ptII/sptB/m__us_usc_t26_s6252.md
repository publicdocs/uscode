## § 6252. Judicial review where administrative adjustment request is not allowed in full

    (a) __In general__ 

    If any part of an administrative adjustment request filed under section 6251 is not allowed by the Secretary, the partnership may file a petition for an adjustment with respect to the partnership items to which such part of the request relates with—

        (1) the Tax Court,

        (2) the district court of the United States for the district in which the principal place of business of the partnership is located, or

        (3) the Claims Court.

    (b) __Period for filing petition__ 

    A petition may be filed under subsection (a) with respect to partnership items for a partnership taxable year only—

        (1) after the expiration of 6 months from the date of filing of the request under section 6251, and

        (2) before the date which is 2 years after the date of such request.

        The 2-year period set forth in paragraph (2) shall be extended for such period as may be agreed upon in writing by the partnership and the Secretary.

    (c) __Coordination with subpart A__ 

        (1) __Notice of partnership adjustment before filing of petition__ 

            No petition may be filed under this section after the Secretary mails to the partnership a notice of a partnership adjustment for the partnership taxable year to which the request under section 6251 relates.

        (2) __Notice of partnership adjustment after filing but before hearing of petition__ 

            If the Secretary mails to the partnership a notice of a partnership adjustment for the partnership taxable year to which the request under section 6251 relates after the filing of a petition under this subsection but before the hearing of such petition, such petition shall be treated as an action brought under section 6247 with respect to such notice, except that subsection (b) of section 6247 shall not apply.

        (3) __Notice must be before expiration of statute of limitations__ 

            A notice of a partnership adjustment for the partnership taxable year shall be taken into account under paragraphs (1) and (2) only if such notice is mailed before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6248 for making adjustments to partnership items for such taxable year.

    (d) __Scope of judicial review__ 

        Except in the case described in paragraph (2) of subsection (c), a court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine only those partnership items to which the part of the request under section 6251 not allowed by the Secretary relates and those items with respect to which the Secretary asserts adjustments as offsets to the adjustments requested by the partnership.

    (e) __Determination of court reviewable__ 

        Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date of the court’s order entering the decision.
