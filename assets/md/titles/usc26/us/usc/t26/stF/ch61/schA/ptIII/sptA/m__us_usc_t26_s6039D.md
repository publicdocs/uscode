        (2) the number of employees of the employer eligible to participate under the plan,

        (3) the number of employees participating under the plan,

        (4) the total cost of the plan during the year,

    (b) __Recordkeeping requirement__ 

        Each employer maintaining a specified fringe benefit plan during any year shall keep such records as may be necessary for purposes of determining whether the requirements of the applicable exclusion are met.

    (c) __Additional information when required by the Secretary__ 

    Any employer—

        (1) who maintains a specified fringe benefit plan during any year for which a return is required under subsection (a), and

        (2) who is required by the Secretary to file an additional return for such year,

        shall file such additional return. Such additional return shall be filed at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall contain such information as the Secretary shall prescribe. The Secretary may require returns under this subsection only from a representative group of employers.
