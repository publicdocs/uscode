## § 6234. Declaratory judgment relating to treatment of items other than partnership items with respect to an oversheltered return

    (a) __General rule__ 

    If—

        (1) a taxpayer files an oversheltered return for a taxable year,

        (2) the Secretary makes a determination with respect to the treatment of items (other than partnership items) of such taxpayer for such taxable year, and

        (3) the adjustments resulting from such determination do not give rise to a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) but would give rise to a deficiency if there were no net loss from partnership items,

        the Secretary is authorized to send a notice of adjustment reflecting such determination to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail.

    (b) __Oversheltered return__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “oversheltered return” means an income tax return which—

        (1) shows no taxable income for the taxable year, and

        (2) shows a net loss from partnership items.

    (c) __Judicial review in the Tax Court__ 

        Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after the day on which the notice of adjustment authorized in subsection (a) is mailed to the taxpayer, the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for redetermination of the adjustments. Upon the filing of such a petition, the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to make a declaration with respect to all items (other than partnership items and affected items which require partner level determinations as described in section 6230(a)(2)(A)(i)) for the taxable year to which the notice of adjustment relates, in accordance with the principles of section 6214(a). Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court and shall be reviewable as such.

    (d) __Failure to file petition__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c), the determination of the Secretary set forth in the notice of adjustment that was mailed to the taxpayer shall be deemed to be correct.

        (2) __Exception__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall not apply after the date that the taxpayer—

            (A) files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c) with respect to a subsequent notice of adjustment relating to the same taxable year, or

            (B) files a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax under section 6511 for the taxable year involved.

            If a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer, then solely for purposes of determining (for the taxable year involved) the amount of any computational adjustment in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section) or the amount of any deficiency attributable to affected items in a proceeding under section 6230(a)(2), the items that are the subject of the notice of adjustment shall be presumed to have been correctly reported on the taxpayer’s return during the pendency of the refund claim (and, if within the time prescribed by section 6532 the taxpayer commences a civil action for refund under section 7422, until the decision in the refund action becomes final).

    (e) __Limitations period__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any notice to a taxpayer under subsection (a) shall be mailed before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6501 (relating to the period of limitations on assessment).

        (2) __Suspension when Secretary mails notice of adjustment__ 

            If the Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year, the period of limitations on the making of assessments shall be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment (and, in any event, if a proceeding in respect of the notice of adjustment is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final), and for 60 days thereafter.

        (3) __Restrictions on assessment__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in section 6851, 6852, or 6861, no assessment of a deficiency with respect to any tax imposed by subtitle A attributable to any item (other than a partnership item or any item affected by a partnership item) shall be made—

            (A) until the expiration of the applicable 90-day or 150-day period set forth in subsection (c) for filing a petition with the Tax Court, or

            (B) if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final.

    (f) __Further notices of adjustment restricted__ 

        If the Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year and the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c), the Secretary may not mail another such notice to the taxpayer with respect to the same taxable year in the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact.

    (g) __Coordination with other proceedings under this subchapter__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The treatment of any item that has been determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) shall be taken into account in determining the amount of any computational adjustment that is made in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section), or the amount of any deficiency attributable to affected items in a proceeding under section 6230(a)(2), for the taxable year involved. Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law pertaining to the period of limitations on the making of assessments, for purposes of the preceding sentence, any adjustment made in accordance with this section shall be taken into account regardless of whether any assessment has been made with respect to such adjustment.

        (2) __Special rule in case of computational adjustment__ 

            In the case of a computational adjustment that is made in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section), the provisions of paragraph (1) shall apply only if the computational adjustment is made within the period prescribed by section 6229 for assessing any tax under subtitle A which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for the taxable year involved.

        (3) __Conversion to deficiency proceeding__ 

        If—

            (A) after the notice referred to in subsection (a) is mailed to a taxpayer for a taxable year but before the expiration of the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court under subsection (c) (or, if a petition is filed with the Tax Court, before the Tax Court makes a declaration for that taxable year), the treatment of any partnership item for the taxable year is finally determined, or any such item ceases to be a partnership item pursuant to section 6231(b), and

            (B) as a result of that final determination or cessation, a deficiency can be determined with respect to the items that are the subject of the notice of adjustment,

            the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a notice of deficiency under section 6212 and any petition filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under section 6213.

        (4) __Finally determined__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the treatment of partnership items shall be treated as finally determined if—

            (A) the Secretary or the Attorney General (or his delegate) enters into a settlement agreement (within the meaning of section 6224) with the taxpayer regarding such items,

            (B)

             a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment has been issued and—

                (i) no petition has been filed under section 6226 and the time for doing so has expired, or

                (ii) a petition has been filed under section 6226 and the decision of the court has become final, or

            (C) the period within which any tax attributable to such items may be assessed against the taxpayer has expired.

    (h) __Special rules if Secretary incorrectly determines applicable procedure__ 

        (1) __Special rule if Secretary erroneously mails notice of adjustment__ 

            If the Secretary erroneously determines that subchapter B does not apply to a taxable year of a taxpayer and consistent with that determination timely mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a notice of deficiency under section 6212 and any petition that is filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under section 6213.

        (2) __Special rule if Secretary erroneously mails notice of deficiency__ 

            If the Secretary erroneously determines that subchapter B applies to a taxable year of a taxpayer and consistent with that determination timely mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer pursuant to section 6212, the notice of deficiency shall be treated as a notice of adjustment under subsection (a) and any petition that is filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under subsection (c).

L. 114–74, title XI, § 1101(a)][/us/pl/114/74/s1101/a], (c)(1), (g), Nov. 2, 2015, [129 Stat. 625][/us/stat/129/625], 634, 638, provided that, applicable to returns filed for partnership taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, with certain exceptions, this section is repealed and a new section 6234 is enacted to read as follows:

>     § 6234. Judicial review of partnership adjustment

    (a) In general

    Within 90 days after the date on which a notice of a final partnership adjustment is mailed under section 6231 with respect to any partnership taxable year, the partnership may file a petition for a readjustment for such taxable year with—

    (1) the Tax Court,

    (2) the district court of the United States for the district in which the partnership’s principal place of business is located, or

    (3) the Claims Court.

    (b) Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Claims Court

    (1) In general

    A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Claims Court only if the partnership filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the date the petition is filed, the amount of the imputed underpayment (as of the date of the filing of the petition) if the partnership adjustment was made as provided by the notice of final partnership adjustment. The court may by order provide that the jurisdictional requirements of this paragraph are satisfied where there has been a good faith attempt to satisfy such requirement and any shortfall of the amount required to be deposited is timely corrected.

    (2) Interest payable

    Any amount deposited under paragraph (1), while deposited, shall not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of this title (other than chapter 67).

    (c) Scope of judicial review

    A court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of final partnership adjustment relates, the proper allocation of such items among the partners, and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership may be liable under this subchapter.

    (d) Determination of court reviewable

    Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date of the court’s order entering the decision.

    (e) Effect of decision dismissing action

    If an action brought under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission under section 6231(c), the decision of the court dismissing the action shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the court.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—Subsec. (g)(4)(A). [Pub. L. 107–147][/us/pl/107/147] inserted “or the Attorney General (or his delegate)” after “Secretary”.
