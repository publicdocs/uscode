        such individual shall pay a penalty of $500 for such statement.

    (b) __Exception__

        (1) the credits against such taxes allowed by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1, and

        (2) the payments of estimated tax which are considered payments on account of such taxes.

    (c) __Deficiency procedures not to apply__
