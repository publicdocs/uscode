    (e) __Exceptions__ 

        (1) __Where tax is small amount__ 

            No addition to tax shall be imposed under subsection (a) for any taxable year if the tax shown on the return for such taxable year (or, if no return is filed, the tax), reduced by the credit allowable under section 31, is less than $1,000.

    (g) __Application of section in case of tax withheld on wages__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of applying this section, the amount of the credit allowed under section 31 for the taxable year shall be deemed a payment of estimated tax, and an equal part of such amount shall be deemed paid on each due date for such taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amounts so withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which such amounts were actually withheld.

        (2) __Separate application__ 

        The taxpayer may apply paragraph (1) separately with respect to—

            (A) wage withholding, and

            (B) all other amounts withheld for which credit is allowed under section 31.

    (h) __Special rule where return filed on or before January 31__ 

        If, on or before January 31 of the following taxable year, the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable, then no addition to tax shall be imposed under subsection (a) with respect to any underpayment of the 4th required installment for the taxable year.
