    (b) __Period__ 

    Such interest shall be allowed and paid as follows:

        (1) __Credits__ 

            In the case of a credit, from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken.

        (2) __Refunds__ 

            In the case of a refund, from the date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.

        (3) __Late returns__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2) in the case of a return of tax which is filed after the last date prescribed for filing such return (determined with regard to extensions), no interest shall be allowed or paid for any day before the date on which the return is filed.

    \[(c) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 85–866, title I, § 83(c)__  __][/us/pl/85/866/s83/c]__  __,__  __Sept. 2, 1958__  __,__  __[__  __72 Stat. 1664__  __][/us/stat/72/1664]__  __\]__ 

    (d) __Advance payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for income tax withholding__ 

        The provisions of section 6513 (except the provisions of subsection (c) thereof, applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitation on credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment for purposes of subsection (a).

    (e) __Disallowance of interest on certain overpayments__ 

        (1) __Refunds within 45 days after return is filed__ 

            If any overpayment of tax imposed by this title is refunded within 45 days after the last day prescribed for filing the return of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return) or, in the case of a return filed after such last date, is refunded within 45 days after the date the return is filed, no interest shall be allowed under subsection (a) on such overpayment.

        (2) __Refunds after claim for credit or refund__ 

        If—

            (A) the taxpayer files a claim for a credit or refund for any overpayment of tax imposed by this title, and

            (B) such overpayment is refunded within 45 days after such claim is filed,

            no interest shall be allowed on such overpayment from the date the claim is filed until the day the refund is made.

        (3) __IRS initiated adjustments__ 

            If an adjustment initiated by the Secretary, results in a refund or credit of an overpayment, interest on such overpayment shall be computed by subtracting 45 days from the number of days interest would otherwise be allowed with respect to such overpayment.

        (4) __Certain withholding taxes__ 

            In the case of any overpayment resulting from tax deducted and withheld under chapter 3 or 4, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall be applied by substituting “180 days” for “45 days” each place it appears.
