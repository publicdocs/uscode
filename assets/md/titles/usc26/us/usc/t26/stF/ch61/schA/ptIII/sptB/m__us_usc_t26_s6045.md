        The written statement required under the preceding sentence shall be furnished to the customer on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year for which the return under subsection (a) was required to be made. In the case of a consolidated reporting statement (as defined in regulations) with respect to any customer, any statement which would otherwise be required to be furnished on or before January 31 of a calendar year with respect to any item reportable to the taxpayer shall instead be required to be furnished on or before February 15 of such calendar year if furnished with such consolidated reporting statement.

            It shall be unlawful for any real estate reporting person to separately charge any customer for complying with any requirement of paragraph (1).

        (4) __Additional information required__

                If such assurance includes an assurance that the seller is married, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “$500,000” for “$250,000”. The Secretary may by regulation increase the dollar amounts under this subparagraph if the Secretary determines that such an increase will not materially reduce revenues to the Treasury.

            (B) __Seller__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “seller” includes the person relinquishing the residence in an exchange.

    (f) __Return required in the case of payments to attorneys__ 

        (1) __In general__
