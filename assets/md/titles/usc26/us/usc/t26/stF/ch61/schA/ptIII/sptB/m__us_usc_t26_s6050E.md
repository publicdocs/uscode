    (a) __Requirement of reporting__ 

        Every person who, with respect to any individual, during any calendar year makes payments of refunds of State or local income taxes (or allows credits or offsets with respect to such taxes) aggregating $10 or more shall make a return according to forms or regulations prescribed by the Secretary setting forth the aggregate amount of such payments, credits, or offsets, and the name and address of the individual with respect to whom such payment, credit, or offset was made.

    (b) __Statements to be furnished to individuals with respect to whom information is required__ 

    Every person required to make a return under subsection (a) shall furnish to each individual whose name is required to be set forth in such return a written statement showing—

        (2) the information required to be shown on the return with respect to refunds, credits, and offsets to the individual.

        The written statement required under the preceding sentence shall be furnished to the individual during January of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the return under subsection (a) was required to be made. No statement shall be required under this subsection with respect to any individual if it is determined (in the manner provided by regulations) that such individual did not claim itemized deductions under chapter 1 for the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit, or offset.
