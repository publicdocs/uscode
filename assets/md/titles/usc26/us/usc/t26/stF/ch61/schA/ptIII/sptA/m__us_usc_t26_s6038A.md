        such corporation shall furnish, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, the information described in subsection (b) and such corporation shall maintain (in the location, in the manner, and to the extent prescribed in regulations) such records as may be appropriate to determine the correct treatment of transactions with related parties as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe (or shall cause another person to so maintain such records).

    (b) __Required information__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a), the information described in this subsection is such information as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations relating to—

        (1)

            (A) is a related party to the reporting corporation, and

            (B) had any transaction with the reporting corporation during its taxable year,

        (2) the manner in which the reporting corporation is related to each person referred to in paragraph (1), and

        (3) transactions between the reporting corporation and each foreign person which is a related party to the reporting corporation.

    (c) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __25-percent foreign-owned__ 

        A corporation is 25-percent foreign-owned if at least 25 percent of—

            (A) the total voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote, or

            (B) the total value of all classes of stock of such corporation,

            is owned at any time during the taxable year by 1 foreign person (hereinafter in this section referred to as a “25-percent foreign shareholder”).

        (2) __Related party__ 

        The term “related party” means—

            (A) any 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation,

            (B) any person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the reporting corporation or to a 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation, and

            (C) any other person who is related (within the meaning of section 482) to the reporting corporation.

        (3) __Foreign person__ 

            The term “foreign person” means any person who is not a United States person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “United States person” has the meaning given to such term by section 7701(a)(30), except that any individual who is a citizen of any possession of the United States (but not otherwise a citizen of the United States) and who is not a resident of the United States shall not be treated as a United States person.

        (4) __Records__ 

            The term “records” includes any books, papers, or other data.

        (5) __Section 318 to apply__ 

        Section 318 shall apply for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), except that—

            (A) “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent” in section 318(a)(2)(C), and

            (B) subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 318(a)(3) shall not be applied so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.

    (d) __Penalty for failure to furnish information or maintain records__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If a reporting corporation—

            (A) fails to furnish (within the time prescribed by regulations) any information described in subsection (b), or

            (B) fails to maintain (or cause another to maintain) records as required by subsection (a),

            such corporation shall pay a penalty of $10,000 for each taxable year with respect to which such failure occurs.

        (2) __Increase in penalty where failure continues after notification__ 

            If any failure described in paragraph (1) continues for more than 90 days after the day on which the Secretary mails notice of such failure to the reporting corporation, such corporation shall pay a penalty (in addition to the amount required under paragraph (1)) of $10,000 for each 30-day period (or fraction thereof) during which such failure continues after the expiration of such 90-day period.

        (3) __Reasonable cause__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the time prescribed by regulations to furnish information or maintain records (and the beginning of the 90-day period after notice by the Secretary) shall be treated as not earlier than the last day on which (as shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary) reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish the information or maintain the records.

    (e) __Enforcement of requests for certain records__ 

        (1) __Agreement to treat corporation as agent__ 

            The rules of paragraph (3) shall apply to any transaction between the reporting corporation and any related party who is a foreign person unless such related party agrees (in such manner and at such time as the Secretary shall prescribe) to authorize the reporting corporation to act as such related party’s limited agent solely for purposes of applying sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 with respect to any request by the Secretary to examine records or produce testimony related to any such transaction or with respect to any summons by the Secretary for such records or testimony. The appearance of persons or production of records by reason of the reporting corporation being such an agent shall not subject such persons or records to legal process for any purpose other than determining the correct treatment under this title of any transaction between the reporting corporation and such related party.

        (2) __Rules where information not furnished__ 

        If—

            (A) for purposes of determining the correct treatment under this title of any transaction between the reporting corporation and a related party who is a foreign person, the Secretary issues a summons to such corporation to produce (either directly or as agent for such related party) any records or testimony,

            (B) such summons is not quashed in a proceeding begun under paragraph (4) and is not determined to be invalid in a proceeding begun under section 7604(b) to enforce such summons, and

            (C) the reporting corporation does not substantially comply in a timely manner with such summons and the Secretary has sent by certified or registered mail a notice to such reporting corporation that such reporting corporation has not so substantially complied,

            the Secretary may apply the rules of paragraph (3) with respect to such transaction (whether or not the Secretary begins a proceeding to enforce such summons). If the reporting corporation fails to maintain (or cause another to maintain) records as required by subsection (a), and by reason of that failure, the summons is quashed in a proceeding described in subparagraph (B) or the reporting corporation is not able to provide the records requested in the summons, the Secretary may apply the rules of paragraph (3) with respect to any transaction to which the records relate.

        (3) __Applicable rules in cases of noncompliance__ 

        If the rules of this paragraph apply to any transaction—

            (A) the amount of the deduction allowed under subtitle A for any amount paid or incurred by the reporting corporation to the related party in connection with such transaction, and

            (B) the cost to the reporting corporation of any property acquired in such transaction from the related party (or transferred by such corporation in such transaction to the related party),

            shall be the amount determined by the Secretary in the Secretary’s sole discretion from the Secretary’s own knowledge or from such information as the Secretary may obtain through testimony or otherwise.

        (4) __Judicial proceedings__ 

            (A) __Proceedings to quash__ 

                Notwithstanding any law or rule of law, any reporting corporation to which the Secretary issues a summons referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall have the right to begin a proceeding to quash such summons not later than the 90th day after such summons was issued. In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with such summons.

            (B) __Review of secretarial determination of noncompliance__ 

                Notwithstanding any law or rule of law, any reporting corporation which has been notified by the Secretary that the Secretary has determined that such corporation has not substantially complied with a summons referred to in paragraph (2) shall have the right to begin a proceeding to review such determination not later than the 90th day after the day on which the notice referred to in paragraph (2)(C) was mailed. If such a proceeding is not begun on or before such 90th day, such determination by the Secretary shall be binding and shall not be reviewed by any court.

            (C) __Jurisdiction__ 

                The United States district court for the district in which the person (to whom the summons is issued) resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear any proceeding brought under subparagraph (A) or (B). Any order or other determination in such a proceeding shall be treated as a final order which may be appealed.

            (D) __Suspension of statute of limitations__ 

                If the reporting corporation brings an action under subparagraph (A) or (B), the running of any period of limitations under section 6501 (relating to assessment and collection of tax) or under section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) with respect to any affected taxable year shall be suspended for the period during which such proceeding, and appeals therein, are pending. In no event shall any such period expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination in such proceeding. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “affected taxable year” means any taxable year if the determination of the amount of tax imposed for such taxable year is affected by the treatment of the transaction to which the summons relates.

    (f) __Cross reference__ 

        For provisions relating to criminal penalties for violation of this section, see section 7203.
