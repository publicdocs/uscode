    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Fishing rights-related activity__ 

            The term “fishing rights-related activity” means, with respect to an Indian tribe, any activity directly related to harvesting, processing, or transporting fish harvested in the exercise of a recognized fishing right of such tribe or to selling such fish but only if substantially all of such harvesting was performed by members of such tribe.

        (2) __Recognized fishing rights__ 

            The term “recognized fishing rights” means, with respect to an Indian tribe, fishing rights secured as of March 17, 1988, by a treaty between such tribe and the United States or by an Executive order or an Act of Congress.

        (3) __Qualified Indian entity__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “qualified Indian entity” means, with respect to an Indian tribe, any entity if—

                (i) such entity is engaged in a fishing rights-related activity of such tribe,

                (ii) all of the equity interests in the entity are owned by qualified Indian tribes, members of such tribes, or their spouses,

                (iii) except as provided in regulations, in the case of an entity which engages to any extent in any substantial processing or transporting of fish, 90 percent or more of the annual gross receipts of the entity is derived from fishing rights-related activities of one or more qualified Indian tribes each of which owns at least 10 percent of the equity interests in the entity, and

                (iv) substantially all of the management functions of the entity are performed by members of qualified Indian tribes.

            (A) derived by a qualified Indian tribal entity, or by an individual through such an entity, is entitled to the benefits of paragraph (1) of subsection (a), or

            (B) paid to an individual for services is entitled to the benefits of paragraph (2) of subsection (a),
