## § 6231. Definitions and special rules

                    The term “partnership” shall not include any partnership having 10 or fewer partners each of whom is an individual (other than a nonresident alien), a C corporation, or an estate of a deceased partner. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a husband and wife (and their estates) shall be treated as 1 partner.

                (ii) __Election to have subchapter apply__

        (3) __Partnership item__ 

            The term “partnership item” means, with respect to a partnership, any item required to be taken into account for the partnership’s taxable year under any provision of subtitle A to the extent regulations prescribed by the Secretary provide that, for purposes of this subtitle, such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.

            The term “nonpartnership item” means an item which is (or is treated as) not a partnership item.

        (5) __Affected item__ 

            The term “affected item” means any item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item.

        (6) __Computational adjustment__ 

            The term “computational adjustment” means the change in the tax liability of a partner which properly reflects the treatment under this subchapter of a partnership item. All adjustments required to apply the results of a proceeding with respect to a partnership under this subchapter to an indirect partner shall be treated as computational adjustments.

        (7) __Tax matters partner__ 

        The tax matters partner of any partnership is—

            (A) the general partner designated as the tax matters partner as provided in regulations, or

            (B) if there is no general partner who has been so designated, the general partner having the largest profits interest in the partnership at the close of the taxable year involved (or, where there is more than 1 such partner, the 1 of such partners whose name would appear first in an alphabetical listing).

            If there is no general partner designated under subparagraph (A) and the Secretary determines that it is impracticable to apply subparagraph (B), the partner selected by the Secretary shall be treated as the tax matters partner. The Secretary shall, within 30 days of selecting a tax matters partner under the preceding sentence, notify all partners required to receive notice under section 6223(a) of the name and address of the person selected.

        (8) __Notice partner__

            The term “pass-thru partner” means a partnership, estate, trust, S corporation, nominee, or other similar person through whom other persons hold an interest in the partnership with respect to which proceedings under this subchapter are conducted.

        (10) __Indirect partner__ 

            The term “indirect partner” means a person holding an interest in a partnership through 1 or more pass-thru partners.

        (12) __Husband and wife__ 

            Except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations, a husband and wife who have a joint interest in a partnership shall be treated as 1 person.

    (b) __Items cease to be partnership items in certain cases__

        (2) __Circumstances in which notice is permitted__

             such partner—

                (i) has complied with subparagraph (B) of section 6222(b)(1) (relating to notification of inconsistent treatment) with respect to one or more of such items, and

                (ii) has not, as of the date on which the Secretary mails the notice, filed a request for administrative adjustments which would make the partner’s treatment of the item or items with respect to which the partner complied with subparagraph (B) of section 6222(b)(1) consistent with the treatment of such item or items on the partnership return, or

            (B)

                (i) such partner has filed a request under section 6227(d) for administrative adjustment of one or more of such items, and

                (ii) the adjustments requested would not make such partner’s treatment of such items consistent with the treatment of such items on the partnership return.

        (3) __Notice must be mailed before beginning of partnership proceeding__ 

            Any notice to a partner under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) with respect to partnership items for a partnership taxable year shall be mailed before the day on which the Secretary mails to the tax matters partner a notice of the beginning of an administrative proceeding at the partnership level with respect to such items.

        (2) __Items may be treated as nonpartnership items__

        (3) __Special rules__ 

            The Secretary may prescribe by regulation such special rules as the Secretary determines to be necessary to achieve the purposes of this subchapter in any case described in paragraph (1).

            (A) in the case of a partner whose entire interest in the partnership is disposed of during such partnership taxable year, as of the moment immediately before such disposition, or

            (B) in the case of any other partner, as of the close of the partnership taxable year.

        (2) __Indirect partners__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe regulations consistent with the principles of paragraph (1) to be applied in the case of indirect partners.

    (e) __Effect of judicial decisions in certain proceedings__ 

        (1) __Determinations at partner level__ 

        No judicial determination with respect to the income tax liability of any partner not conducted under this subchapter shall be a bar to any adjustment in such partner’s income tax liability resulting from—

            (B)

             a proceeding with respect to items which become nonpartnership items—

                (i) by reason of 1 or more of the events described in subsection (b), and

                (ii) after the appropriate time for including such items in any other proceeding with respect to nonpartnership items.

        (2) __Proceedings under section 6228(a)__

    (f) __Special rule for deductions, losses, and credits of foreign partnerships__ 

        Except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations, in the case of any partnership the tax matters partner of which resides outside the United States or the books of which are maintained outside the United States, no deduction, loss, or credit shall be allowable to any partner unless section 6031 is complied with for the partnership’s taxable year in which such deduction, loss, or credit arose at such time as the Secretary prescribes by regulations.

    (g) __Partnership return to be determinative of whether subchapter applies__ 

        (1) __Determination that subchapter applies__ 

            If, on the basis of a partnership return for a taxable year, the Secretary reasonably determines that this subchapter applies to such partnership for such year but such determination is erroneous, then the provisions of this subchapter are hereby extended to such partnership (and its items) for such taxable year and to partners of such partnership.

        (2) __Determination that subchapter does not apply__ 

            If, on the basis of a partnership return for a taxable year, the Secretary reasonably determines that this subchapter does not apply to such partnership for such year but such determination is erroneous, then the provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to such partnership (and its items) for such taxable year or to partners of such partnership.
