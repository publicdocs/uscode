    (a) __General rule__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, when a return of tax is required under this title or regulations, the person required to make such return shall, without assessment or notice and demand from the Secretary, pay such tax to the internal revenue officer with whom the return is filed, and shall pay such tax at the time and place fixed for filing the return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return).

    (b) __Exceptions__ 

        (1) __Income tax not computed by taxpayer__

        (2) __Use of government depositaries__ 

            For authority of the Secretary to require payments to Government depositaries, see section 6302(c).

    (c) __Date fixed for payment of tax__ 

        In any case in which a tax is required to be paid on or before a certain date, or within a certain period, any reference in this title to the date fixed for payment of such tax shall be deemed a reference to the last day fixed for such payment (determined without regard to any extension of time for paying the tax.)
