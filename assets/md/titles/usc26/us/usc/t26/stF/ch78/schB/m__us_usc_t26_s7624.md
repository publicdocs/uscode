## § 7624. Reimbursement to State and local law enforcement agencies

    (a) __Authorization of reimbursement__ 

        Whenever a State or local law enforcement agency provides information to the Internal Revenue Service that substantially contributes to the recovery of Federal taxes imposed with respect to illegal drug-related activities (or money laundering in connection with such activities), such agency may be reimbursed by the Internal Revenue Service for costs incurred in the investigation (including but not limited to reasonable expenses, per diem, salary, and overtime) not to exceed 10 percent of the sum recovered.

    (b) __Records; 10 percent limitation__ 

        The Internal Revenue Service shall maintain records of the receipt of information from a contributing agency and shall notify the agency when monies have been recovered as the result of such information. Following such notification, the agency shall submit a statement detailing the investigative costs it incurred. Where more than 1 State or local agency has given information that substantially contributes to the recovery of Federal taxes, the Internal Revenue Service shall equitably allocate investigative costs among such agencies not to exceed an aggregate amount of 10 percent of the taxes recovered.

    (c) __No reimbursement where duplicative__ 

        No State or local agency may receive reimbursement under this section if reimbursement has been received by such agency under a Federal or State forfeiture program or under State revenue laws.
