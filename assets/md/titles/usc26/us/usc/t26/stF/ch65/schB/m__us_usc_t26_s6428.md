        (2) $600 ($1,200 in the case of a joint return).

    (b) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (2)—

            (A) the amount determined under subsection (a) shall not be less than $300 ($600 in the case of a joint return), and

            (B) the amount determined under subsection (a) (after the application of subparagraph (A)) shall be increased by the product of $300 multiplied by the number of qualifying children (within the meaning of section 24(c)) of the taxpayer.

        (2) __Taxpayer described__ 

        A taxpayer is described in this paragraph if the taxpayer—

            (A) has qualifying income of at least $3,000, or

            (B)

             has—

                (i) net income tax liability which is greater than zero, and

                (ii) gross income which is greater than the sum of the basic standard deduction plus the exemption amount (twice the exemption amount in the case of a joint return).

    (c) __Treatment of credit__ 

        The credit allowed by subsection (a) shall be treated as allowed by subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1.

    (d) __Limitation based on adjusted gross income__ 

        The amount of the credit allowed by subsection (a) (determined without regard to this subsection and subsection (f)) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 5 percent of so much of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income as exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 in the case of a joint return).

    (e) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Qualifying income__ 

        The term “qualifying income” means—

            (B) social security benefits (within the meaning of section 86(d)), and

            (C) any compensation or pension received under chapter 11, chapter 13, or chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code.

        (2) __Net income tax liability__ 

        The term “net income tax liability” means the excess of—

            (A) the sum of the taxpayer’s regular tax liability (within the meaning of section 26(b)) and the tax imposed by section 55 for the taxable year, over

            (B) the credits allowed by part IV (other than section 24 and subpart C thereof) of subchapter A of chapter 1.

        (3) __Eligible individual__ 

        The term “eligible individual” means any individual other than—

            The amount of credit which would (but for this paragraph) be allowable under this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate refunds and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer under subsection (g).

        (2) __Joint returns__ 

            In the case of a refund or credit made or allowed under subsection (g) with respect to a joint return, half of such refund or credit shall be treated as having been made or allowed to each individual filing such return.

    (g) __Advance refunds and credits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each individual who was an eligible individual for such individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2007 shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such first taxable year in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for such taxable year.

        (2) __Advance refund amount__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the advance refund amount is the amount that would have been allowed as a credit under this section for such first taxable year if this section (other than subsection (f) and this subsection) had applied to such taxable year.

        (3) __Timing of payments__ 

            The Secretary shall, subject to the provisions of this title, refund or credit any overpayment attributable to this section as rapidly as possible. No refund or credit shall be made or allowed under this subsection after December 31, 2008.
