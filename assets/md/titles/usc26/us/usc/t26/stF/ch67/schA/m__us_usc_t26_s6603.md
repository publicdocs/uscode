## § 6603. Deposits made to suspend running of interest on potential underpayments, etc.

    (a) __Authority to make deposits other than as payment of tax__ 

        A taxpayer may make a cash deposit with the Secretary which may be used by the Secretary to pay any tax imposed under subtitle A or B or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 which has not been assessed at the time of the deposit. Such a deposit shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe.

    (b) __No interest imposed__ 

        To the extent that such deposit is used by the Secretary to pay tax, for purposes of section 6601 (relating to interest on underpayments), the tax shall be treated as paid when the deposit is made.

    (c) __Return of deposit__ 

        Except in a case where the Secretary determines that collection of tax is in jeopardy, the Secretary shall return to the taxpayer any amount of the deposit (to the extent not used for a payment of tax) which the taxpayer requests in writing.

    (d) __Payment of interest__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of section 6611 (relating to interest on overpayments), except as provided in paragraph (4), a deposit which is returned to a taxpayer shall be treated as a payment of tax for any period to the extent (and only to the extent) attributable to a disputable tax for such period. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of section 6611(b)(2) shall apply.

        (2) __Disputable tax__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this section, the term “disputable tax” means the amount of tax specified at the time of the deposit as the taxpayer’s reasonable estimate of the maximum amount of any tax attributable to disputable items.

            (B) __Safe harbor based on 30-day letter__ 

                In the case of a taxpayer who has been issued a 30-day letter, the maximum amount of tax under subparagraph (A) shall not be less than the amount of the proposed deficiency specified in such letter.

        (3) __Other definitions__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (2)—

            (A) __Disputable item__ 

            The term “disputable item” means any item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit if the taxpayer—

                (i) has a reasonable basis for its treatment of such item, and

                (ii) reasonably believes that the Secretary also has a reasonable basis for disallowing the taxpayer’s treatment of such item.

            (B) __30-day letter__ 

                The term “30-day letter” means the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.

        (4) __Rate of interest__ 

            The rate of interest under this subsection shall be the Federal short-term rate determined under section 6621(b), compounded daily.

    (e) __Use of deposits__ 

        (1) __Payment of tax__ 

            Except as otherwise provided by the taxpayer, deposits shall be treated as used for the payment of tax in the order deposited.

        (2) __Returns of deposits__ 

            Deposits shall be treated as returned to the taxpayer on a last-in, first-out basis.
