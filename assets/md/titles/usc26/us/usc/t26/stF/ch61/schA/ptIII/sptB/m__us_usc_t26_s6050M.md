        (2) __Reporting requirement__ 

        Each Federal executive agency which has entered into a contract described in paragraph (3) shall, upon a request of the Secretary which identifies a particular person, acknowledge whether such person has entered into such a contract with such agency and, if so, provide to the Secretary—

            (B) the head of such Federal executive agency (or his designee) pursuant to regulations issued by such agency determines, in writing, that filing the required return under this section would interfere with the effective conduct of a confidential law enforcement or foreign counterintelligence activity.
