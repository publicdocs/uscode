    (f) __Adjustment for inflation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of any failure relating to a return required to be filed in a calendar year beginning after 2014, each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a), (b), (d) (other than paragraph (2)(A) thereof), and (e) shall be increased by such dollar amount multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) determined by substituting “calendar year 2011” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

        (2) __Rounding__ 

        If any amount adjusted under paragraph (1)—
