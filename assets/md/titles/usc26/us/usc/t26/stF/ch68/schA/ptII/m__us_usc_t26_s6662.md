        (7) Any undisclosed foreign financial asset understatement.

        This section shall not apply to any portion of an underpayment on which a penalty is imposed under section 6663. Except as provided in paragraph (1) or (2)(B) of section 6662A(e), this section shall not apply to the portion of any underpayment which is attributable to a reportable transaction understatement on which a penalty is imposed under section 6662A.

    (d) __Substantial understatement of income tax__ 

        (1) __Substantial understatement__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Special rule for corporations__ 

            In the case of a corporation other than an S corporation or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542), there is a substantial understatement of income tax for any taxable year if the amount of the understatement for the taxable year exceeds the lesser of—

                (i) 10 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if greater, $10,000), or

                (ii) $10,000,000.

        (2) __Understatement__ 

            (A) __In general__

                The excess under the preceding sentence shall be determined without regard to items to which section 6662A applies.

            (B) __Reduction for understatement due to position of taxpayer or disclosed item__ 

            The amount of the understatement under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to—

                    (I) the relevant facts affecting the item’s tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return, and

                    (II) there is a reasonable basis for the tax treatment of such item by the taxpayer.

            (B) __Certain adjustments excluded in determining threshold__ 

            For purposes of determining whether the threshold requirements of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) are met, the following shall be excluded:

                (i)

                 Any portion of the net increase in taxable income referred to in subparagraph (A) which is attributable to any redetermination of a price if—

                    (II) the taxpayer has documentation (which was in existence as of the time of filing the return) which sets forth the determination of such price in accordance with such a method and which establishes that the use of such method was reasonable, and

                    (III) the taxpayer provides such documentation to the Secretary within 30 days of a request for such documentation.

                (ii)

                    (III) the taxpayer provides such documentation to the Secretary within 30 days of request for such documentation.

                (iii) Any portion of such net increase which is attributable to any transaction solely between foreign corporations unless, in the case of any such corporations, the treatment of such transaction affects the determination of income from sources within the United States or taxable income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

            (C) __Special rule__ 

                If the regular tax (as defined in section 55(c)) imposed by chapter 1 on the taxpayer is determined by reference to an amount other than taxable income, such amount shall be treated as the taxable income of such taxpayer for purposes of this paragraph.

            (D) __Coordination with reasonable cause exception__ 

                For purposes of section 6664(c) the taxpayer shall not be treated as having reasonable cause for any portion of an underpayment attributable to a net section 482 transfer price adjustment unless such taxpayer meets the requirements of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (B) with respect to such portion.
