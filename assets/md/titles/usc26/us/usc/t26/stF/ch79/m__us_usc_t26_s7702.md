        (2)

            (A) meets the guideline premium requirements of subsection (c), and

            (B) falls within the cash value corridor of subsection (d).

    (b) __Cash value accumulation test for subsection (a)(1)__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A contract meets the cash value accumulation test of this subsection if, by the terms of the contract, the cash surrender value of such contract may not at any time exceed the net single premium which would have to be paid at such time to fund future benefits under the contract.

        (2) __Rules for applying paragraph (1)__ 

        Determinations under paragraph (1) shall be made—

            (A) on the basis of interest at the greater of an annual effective rate of 4 percent or the rate or rates guaranteed on issuance of the contract,

            (B) on the basis of the rules of subparagraph (B)(i) (and, in the case of qualified additional benefits, subparagraph (B)(ii)) of subsection (c)(3), and

            (C) by taking into account under subparagraphs (A) and (D) of subsection (e)(1) only current and future death benefits and qualified additional benefits.

    (c) __Guideline premium requirements__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            A contract meets the guideline premium requirements of this subsection if the sum of the premiums paid under such contract does not at any time exceed the guideline premium limitation as of such time.

        (2) __Guideline premium limitation__ 

        The term “guideline premium limitation” means, as of any date, the greater of—

            (A) the guideline single premium, or

            (B) the sum of the guideline level premiums to such date.

        (3) __Guideline single premium__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “guideline single premium” means the premium at issue with respect to future benefits under the contract.

            (B) __Basis on which determination is made__ 

            The determination under subparagraph (A) shall be based on—

                (i) reasonable mortality charges which meet the requirements (if any) prescribed in regulations and which (except as provided in regulations) do not exceed the mortality charges specified in the prevailing commissioners’ standard tables (as defined in section 807(d)(5)) as of the time the contract is issued,

                (ii) any reasonable charges (other than mortality charges) which (on the basis of the company’s experience, if any, with respect to similar contracts) are reasonably expected to be actually paid, and

                (iii) interest at the greater of an annual effective rate of 6 percent or the rate or rates guaranteed on issuance of the contract.

            (C) __When determination made__ 

                Except as provided in subsection (f)(7), the determination under subparagraph (A) shall be made as of the time the contract is issued.

            (D) __Special rules for subparagraph (B)(ii)__ 

                (i) __Charges not specified in the contract__ 

                    If any charge is not specified in the contract, the amount taken into account under subparagraph (B)(ii) for such charge shall be zero.

                (ii) __New companies, etc.__ 

                    If any company does not have adequate experience for purposes of the determination under subparagraph (B)(ii), to the extent provided in regulations, such determination shall be made on the basis of the industry-wide experience.

        (4) __Guideline level premium__ 

            The term “guideline level premium” means the level annual amount, payable over a period not ending before the insured attains age 95, computed on the same basis as the guideline single premium, except that paragraph (3)(B)(iii) shall be applied by substituting “4 percent” for “6 percent”.

    (d) __Cash value corridor for purposes of subsection (a)(2)(B)__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__

    (e) __Computational rules__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section (other than subsection (d))—

            (A) the death benefit (and any qualified additional benefit) shall be deemed not to increase,

            (B) the maturity date, including the date on which any benefit described in subparagraph (C) is payable, shall be deemed to be no earlier than the day on which the insured attains age 95, and no later than the day on which the insured attains age 100,

            (C) the death benefits shall be deemed to be provided until the maturity date determined by taking into account subparagraph (B), and

            (D) the amount of any endowment benefit (or sum of endowment benefits, including any cash surrender value on the maturity date determined by taking into account subparagraph (B)) shall be deemed not to exceed the least amount payable as a death benefit at any time under the contract.

        (2) __Limited increases in death benefit permitted__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A)—

            (A) for purposes of computing the guideline level premium, an increase in the death benefit which is provided in the contract may be taken into account but only to the extent necessary to prevent a decrease in the excess of the death benefit over the cash surrender value of the contract,

            (B) for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the increase described in subparagraph (A) may be taken into account if the contract will meet such test at all times assuming that the net level reserve (determined as if level annual premiums were paid for the contract over a period not ending before the insured attains age 95) is substituted for the net single premium, and

            (C)

             for purposes of the cash value accumulation test, the death benefit increases may be taken into account if the contract—

                (i) has an initial death benefit of $5,000 or less and a maximum death benefit of $25,000 or less,

                (ii) provides for a fixed predetermined annual increase not to exceed 10 percent of the initial death benefit or 8 percent of the death benefit at the end of the preceding year, and

                (iii) was purchased to cover payment of burial expenses or in connection with prearranged funeral expenses.

            For purposes of subparagraph (C), the initial death benefit of a contract shall be determined by treating all contracts issued to the same contract owner as 1 contract.

    (f) __Other definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Premiums paid__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “premiums paid” means the premiums paid under the contract less amounts (other than amounts includible in gross income) to which section 72(e) applies and less any excess premiums with respect to which there is a distribution described in subparagraph (B) or (E) of paragraph (7) and any other amounts received with respect to the contract which are specified in regulations.

            (B) __Treatment of certain premiums returned to policyholder__ 

                If, in order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(A), any portion of any premium paid during any contract year is returned by the insurance company (with interest) within 60 days after the end of a contract year, the amount so returned (excluding interest) shall be deemed to reduce the sum of the premiums paid under the contract during such year.

            (C) __Interest returned includible in gross income__ 

                Notwithstanding the provisions of section 72(e), the amount of any interest returned as provided in subparagraph (B) shall be includible in the gross income of the recipient.

        (2) __Cash values__ 

            (A) __Cash surrender value__ 

                The cash surrender value of any contract shall be its cash value determined without regard to any surrender charge, policy loan, or reasonable termination dividends.

                The net surrender value of any contract shall be determined with regard to surrender charges but without regard to any policy loan.

                (iii) family term coverage,

                (iv) disability waiver benefit, or

                (v) other benefit prescribed under regulations.

            (B) __Treatment of qualified additional benefits__ 

                For purposes of this section, qualified additional benefits shall not be treated as future benefits under the contract, but the charges for such benefits shall be treated as future benefits.

            (C) __Treatment of other additional benefits__ 

            In the case of any additional benefit which is not a qualified additional benefit—

                (i) such benefit shall not be treated as a future benefit, and

                (ii) any charge for such benefit which is not prefunded shall not be treated as a premium.

        (6) __Premium payments not disqualifying contract__ 

            The payment of a premium which would result in the sum of the premiums paid exceeding the guideline premium limitation shall be disregarded for purposes of subsection (a)(2) if the amount of such premium does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent the termination of the contract on or before the end of the contract year (but only if the contract will have no cash surrender value at the end of such extension period).

        (7) __Adjustments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If there is a change in the benefits under (or in other terms of) the contract which was not reflected in any previous determination or adjustment made under this section, there shall be proper adjustments in future determinations made under this section.

            (B) __Rule for certain changes during first 15 years__ 

            If—

                (i) a change described in subparagraph (A) reduces benefits under the contract,

                (ii) the change occurs during the 15-year period beginning on the issue date of the contract, and

                (iii) a cash distribution is made to the policyholder as a result of such change,

                section 72 (other than subsection (e)(5) thereof) shall apply to such cash distribution to the extent it does not exceed the recapture ceiling determined under subparagraph (C) or (D) (whichever applies).

            (C) __Recapture ceiling where change occurs during first 5 years__ 

            If the change referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii) occurs during the 5-year period beginning on the issue date of the contract, the recapture ceiling is—

                (i)

                 in the case of a contract to which subsection (a)(1) applies, the excess of—

                    (I) the cash surrender value of the contract, immediately before the reduction, over

                    (II) the net single premium (determined under subsection (b)), immediately after the reduction, or

                (ii)

                 in the case of a contract to which subsection (a)(2) applies, the greater of—

                    (I) the excess of the aggregate premiums paid under the contract, immediately before the reduction, over the guideline premium limitation for the contract (determined under subsection (c)(2), taking into account the adjustment described in subparagraph (A)), or

                    (II) the excess of the cash surrender value of the contract, immediately before the reduction, over the cash value corridor of subsection (d) (determined immediately after the reduction).

            (D) __Recapture ceiling where change occurs after 5th year and before 16th year__ 

                If the change referred to in subparagraph (B) occurs after the 5-year period referred to under subparagraph (C), the recapture ceiling is the excess of the cash surrender value of the contract, immediately before the reduction, over the cash value corridor of subsection (d) (determined immediately after the reduction and whether or not subsection (d) applies to the contract).

            (E) __Treatment of certain distributions made in anticipation of benefit reductions__ 

                Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subparagraph (B) shall apply also to any distribution made in anticipation of a reduction in benefits under the contract. For purposes of the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (D); and any distribution which reduces the cash surrender value of a contract and which is made within 2 years before a reduction in benefits under the contract shall be treated as made in anticipation of such reduction.

        (8) __Correction of errors__ 

        If the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

            (A) the requirements described in subsection (a) for any contract year were not satisfied due to reasonable error, and

            (B) reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the error,

            the Secretary may waive the failure to satisfy such requirements.

        (9) __Special rule for variable life insurance contracts__ 

            In the case of any contract which is a variable contract (as defined in section 817), the determination of whether such contract meets the requirements of subsection (a) shall be made whenever the death benefits under such contract change but not less frequently than once during each 12-month period.

        (1) __Income inclusion__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Income on the contract__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “income on the contract” means, with respect to any taxable year of the policyholder, the excess of—

                (ii) the premiums paid (as defined in subsection (f)(1)) under the contract during the taxable year.

            (C) __Contracts which cease to meet definition__ 

                If, during any taxable year of the policyholder, a contract which is a life insurance contract under the applicable law ceases to meet the definition of life insurance contract under subsection (a), the income on the contract for all prior taxable years shall be treated as received or accrued during the taxable year in which such cessation occurs.

            If any contract which is a life insurance contract under the applicable law does not meet the definition of life insurance contract under subsection (a), such contract shall, notwithstanding such failure, be treated as an insurance contract for purposes of this title.

    (h) __Endowment contracts receive same treatment__ 

        (1) __In general__
