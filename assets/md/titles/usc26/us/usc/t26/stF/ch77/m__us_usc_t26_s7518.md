## § 7518. Tax incentives relating to merchant marine capital construction funds

    (a) __Ceiling on deposits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The amount deposited in a fund established under chapter 535 of title 46 of the United States Code (hereinafter in this section referred to as a “capital construction fund”) shall not exceed for any taxable year the sum of:

            (A) that portion of the taxable income of the owner or lessee for such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States,

            (B) the amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 for such year with respect to the agreement vessels,

            (C)

             if the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (A), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from—

                (i) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessel, or

                (ii) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessel, and

            (D) the receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund.

        (2) __Limitations on deposits by lessees__ 

            In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an agreement entered into under chapter 535 of title 46, United States Code, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B).

        (3) __Certain barges and containers included__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “agreement vessel” includes barges and containers which are part of the complement of such vessel and which are provided for in the agreement.

    (b) __Requirements as to investments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Amounts in any capital construction fund shall be kept in the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and shall be subject to such trustee and other fiduciary requirements as may be specified by the Secretary.

        (2) __Limitation on fund investments__ 

            Amounts in any capital construction fund may be invested only in interest-bearing securities approved by the Secretary; except that, if such Secretary consents thereto, an agreed percentage (not in excess of 60 percent) of the assets of the fund may be invested in the stock of domestic corporations. Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their capital. If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage.

        (3) __Investment in certain preferred stock permitted__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the requirements of this subsection and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection.

    (c) __Nontaxability for deposits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this title—

            (A) taxable income (determined without regard to this section and chapter 535 of title 46, United States Code) for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A),

            (B) gain from a transaction referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C) shall not be taken into account if an amount equal to the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from such transaction is deposited in the fund,

            (C) the earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund shall not be taken into account,

            (D) the earnings and profits (within the meaning of section 316) of any corporation shall be determined without regard to this section and chapter 535 of title 46, United States Code, and

            (E) in applying the tax imposed by section 531 (relating to the accumulated earnings tax), amounts while held in the fund shall not be taken into account.

        (2) __Only qualified deposits eligible for treatment__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in joint regulations.

            (D) interest income exempt from taxation under section 103.

        (3) __Capital gain account__ 

        The capital gain account shall consist of—

            (A) amounts representing capital gains on assets held for more than 6 months and referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C) or (a)(1)(D), reduced by

            (B) amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund for more than 6 months.

        (4) __Ordinary income account__ 

        The ordinary income account shall consist of—

            (A) amounts referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A),

            Except on termination of a capital construction fund, capital losses referred to in paragraph (3)(B) or in paragraph (4)(B)(ii) shall be allowed only as an offset to gains referred to in paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(B)(i), respectively.

    (e) __Purposes of qualified withdrawals__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        A qualified withdrawal from the fund is one made in accordance with the terms of the agreement but only if it is for:

            (A) the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel,

            (B) the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel, or

            (C) the payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel.

            Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subparagraph (B), and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates only to barges and containers, shall apply only with respect to barges and containers constructed in the United States.

        (2) __Penalty for failing to fulfill any substantial obligation__ 

            Under joint regulations, if the Secretary determines that any substantial obligation under any agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the person maintaining the fund, treat the entire fund or any portion thereof as an amount withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal.

    (f) __Tax treatment of qualified withdrawals__ 

        (1) __Ordering rule__ 

        Any qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—

            (A) first as made out of the capital account,

            (B) second as made out of the capital gain account, and

            (C) third as made out of the ordinary income account.

        (2) __Adjustment to basis of vessel, etc., where withdrawal from ordinary income account__ 

            If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.

        (3) __Adjustment to basis of vessel, etc., where withdrawal from capital gain account__ 

            If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.

        (4) __Adjustment to basis of vessels, etc., where withdrawals pay principal on debt__ 

            If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal on any indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then an amount equal to the aggregate reduction which would be required by paragraphs (2) and (3) if this were a qualified withdrawal for a purpose described in such paragraphs shall be applied, in the order provided in joint regulations, to reduce the basis of vessels, barges, and containers owned by the person maintaining the fund. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of the preceding sentence shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.

        (5) __Ordinary income recapture of basis reduction__ 

            If any property the basis of which was reduced under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) is disposed of, any gain realized on such disposition, to the extent it does not exceed the aggregate reduction in the basis of such property under such paragraphs, shall be treated as an amount referred to in subsection (g)(3)(A) which was withdrawn on the date of such disposition. Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be provided in joint regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to a disposition where there is a redeposit in an amount determined under joint regulations which will, insofar as practicable, restore the fund to the position it was in before the withdrawal.

    (g) __Tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subsection (h), any withdrawal from a capital construction fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.

        (2) __Ordering rule__ 

        Any nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—

            (A) first as made out of the ordinary income account,

            (B) second as made out of the capital gain account, and

            (C) third as made out of the capital account.

            For purposes of this section, items withdrawn from any account shall be treated as withdrawn on a first-in-first-out basis; except that (i) any nonqualified withdrawal for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery and equipment, and (ii) any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of subsection (f)(4), shall be treated as withdrawn on a last-in-first-out basis.

        (3) __Operating rules__ 

        For purposes of this title—

            (A) any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall be included in income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made,

            (B) any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(B) shall be included in income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made as an item of gain realized during such year from the disposition of an asset held for more than 6 months, and

            (C)

             for the period on or before the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year in which this withdrawal is made—

                (i) no interest shall be payable under section 6601 and no addition to the tax shall be payable under section 6651,

                (ii) interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable to any item referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be paid at the applicable rate (as defined in paragraph (4)) from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund, and

                (iii) no interest shall be payable on amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on December 31, 1969.

        (4) __Interest rate__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(ii), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal—

            (A) made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 or 1971 is 8 percent, or

            (B) made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, shall be determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the applicable Secretary and shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine under joint regulations to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970.

        (5) __Amount not withdrawn from fund after 25 years from deposit taxed as nonqualified withdrawal__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The applicable percentage of any amount which remains in a capital construction fund at the close of the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, or 30th taxable year following the taxable year for which such amount was deposited shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal in accordance with the following table:

  </tr>

                </table>

            (B) __Earnings treated as deposits__ 

                The earnings of any capital construction fund for any taxable year (other than net gains) shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph as an amount deposited for such taxable year.

            (C) __Amounts committed treated as withdrawn__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), an amount shall not be treated as remaining in a capital construction fund at the close of any taxable year to the extent there is a binding contract at the close of such year for a qualified withdrawal of such amount with respect to an identified item for which such withdrawal may be made.

            (D) __Authority to treat excess funds as withdrawn__ 

                If the Secretary determines that the balance in any capital construction fund exceeds the amount which is appropriate to meet the vessel construction program objectives of the person who established such fund, the amount of such excess shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under subparagraph (A) unless such person develops appropriate program objectives within 3 years to dissipate such excess.

            (E) __Amounts in fund on__  __January 1, 1987__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, all amounts in a capital construction fund on January 1, 1987, shall be treated as deposited in such fund on such date.

        (6) __Nonqualified withdrawals taxed at highest marginal rate__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of any taxable year for which there is a nonqualified withdrawal (including any amount so treated under paragraph (5)), the tax imposed by chapter 1 shall be determined—

                (i) by excluding such withdrawal from gross income, and

                (ii) by increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 by the product of the amount of such withdrawal and the highest rate of tax specified in section 1 (section 11 in the case of a corporation).

                With respect to the portion of any nonqualified withdrawal made out of the capital gain account during a taxable year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a) applies, the rate of tax taken into account under the preceding sentence shall not exceed 20 percent (34 percent in the case of a corporation).

            (B) __Tax benefit rule__ 

            If any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (other than earnings on deposits) made by the taxpayer in any taxable year which did not reduce the taxpayer’s liability for tax under chapter 1 for any taxable year preceding the taxable year in which such withdrawal occurs—

                (i) such portion shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (A), and

                (ii) an amount equal to such portion shall be treated as allowed as a deduction under section 172 for the taxable year in which such withdrawal occurs.

            (C) __Coordination with deduction for net operating losses__ 

                Any nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under subparagraph (A) shall be excluded in determining taxable income under section 172(b)(2).

    (h) __Certain corporate reorganizations and changes in partnerships__ 

    Under joint regulations—

        (1) a transfer of a fund from one person to another person in a transaction to which section 381 applies may be treated as if such transaction did not constitute a nonqualified withdrawal, and

        (2) a similar rule shall be applied in the case of a continuation of a partnership.

    (i) __Definitions__ 

        For purposes of this section, any term defined in section 607(k) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 which is also used in this section (including the definition of “Secretary”) shall have the meaning given such term by such section 607(k) as in effect on the date of the enactment of this section.
