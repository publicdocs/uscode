        (3) __Individuals on basis other than weekly__ 

            In the case of any individual not described in paragraph (1), the amount of the wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by him during any applicable pay period or other fiscal period (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) which is exempt from levy under subsection (a)(9) shall be an amount (determined under such regulations) which as nearly as possible will result in the same total exemption from levy for such individual over a period of time as he would have under paragraph (1) if (during such period of time) he were paid or received such wages, salary, and other income on a regular weekly basis.

            (A) a district director or assistant district director of the Internal Revenue Service personally approves (in writing) the levy of such property; or

            (B) the Secretary finds that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.

            An official may not approve a levy under subparagraph (A) unless the official determines that the taxpayer’s other assets subject to collection are insufficient to pay the amount due, together with expenses of the proceedings.

    (f) __Levy allowed on certain specified payments__ 

        Any payment described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 6331(h)(2) shall not be exempt from levy if the Secretary approves the levy thereon under section 6331(h).

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of any calendar year beginning after 1999, each dollar amount referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, by substituting “calendar year 1998” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.
