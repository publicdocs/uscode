## § 6698. Failure to file partnership return

    (a) __General rule__ 

    In addition to the penalty imposed by section 7203 (relating to willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax), if any partnership required to file a return under section 6031 for any taxable year—

        (1) fails to file such return at the time prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), or

        (2) files a return which fails to show the information required under section 6031,

        such partnership shall be liable for a penalty determined under subsection (b) for each month (or fraction thereof) during which such failure continues (but not to exceed 12 months), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause.

    (b) __Amount per month__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a), the amount determined under this subsection for any month is the product of—

        (1) $195, multiplied by

        (2) the number of persons who were partners in the partnership during any part of the taxable year  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period. </sup></sup> 

    (c) __Assessment of penalty__ 

        The penalty imposed by subsection (a) shall be assessed against the partnership.

    (d) __Deficiency procedures not to apply__ 

        Subchapter B of chapter 63 (relating to deficiency procedures for income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes) shall not apply in respect of the assessment or collection of any penalty imposed by subsection (a).

    (e) __Adjustment for inflation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of any return required to be filed in a calendar year beginning after 2014, the $195 dollar amount under subsection (b)(1) shall be increased by such dollar amount multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) determined by substituting “calendar year 2013” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

        (2) __Rounding__ 

            If any amount adjusted under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of $5, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $5.
