    (b) __Certain joint interests of husband and wife__ 

        (1) __Interests of spouse excluded from gross estate__ 

            Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of any qualified joint interest, the value included in the gross estate with respect to such interest by reason of this section is one-half of the value of such qualified joint interest.

        (2) __Qualified joint interest defined__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “qualified joint interest” means any interest in property held by the decedent and the decedent’s spouse as—

            (A) tenants by the entirety, or

            (B) joint tenants with right of survivorship, but only if the decedent and the spouse of the decedent are the only joint tenants.
