## § 2057. Family-owned business interests

    (a) __General rule__ 

        (1) __Allowance of deduction__ 

            For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, in the case of an estate of a decedent to which this section applies, the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate the adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests of the decedent which are described in subsection (b)(2).

        (2) __Maximum deduction__ 

            The deduction allowed by this section shall not exceed $675,000.

        (3) __Coordination with unified credit__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if this section applies to an estate, the applicable exclusion amount under section 2010 shall be $625,000.

            (B) __Increase in unified credit if deduction is less than $675,000__ 

                If the deduction allowed by this section is less than $675,000, the amount of the applicable exclusion amount under section 2010 shall be increased (but not above the amount which would apply to the estate without regard to this section) by the excess of $675,000 over the amount of the deduction allowed.

    (b) __Estates to which section applies__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        This section shall apply to an estate if—

            (A) the decedent was (at the date of the decedent’s death) a citizen or resident of the United States,

            (B) the executor elects the application of this section and files the agreement referred to in subsection (h),

            (C)

             the sum of—

                (i) the adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests described in paragraph (2), plus

                (ii) the amount of the gifts of such interests determined under paragraph (3),

                exceeds 50 percent of the adjusted gross estate, and

            (D)

             during the 8-year period ending on the date of the decedent’s death there have been periods aggregating 5 years or more during which—

                (i) such interests were owned by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family, and

                (ii) there was material participation (within the meaning of section 2032A(e)(6)) by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family in the operation of the business to which such interests relate.

        (2) __Includible qualified family-owned business interests__ 

        The qualified family-owned business interests described in this paragraph are the interests which—

            (A) are included in determining the value of the gross estate, and

            (B) are acquired by any qualified heir from, or passed to any qualified heir from, the decedent (within the meaning of section 2032A(e)(9)).

        (3) __Includible gifts of interests__ 

        The amount of the gifts of qualified family-owned business interests determined under this paragraph is the sum of—

            (A) the amount of such gifts from the decedent to members of the decedent’s family taken into account under section 2001(b)(1)(B), plus

            (B) the amount of such gifts otherwise excluded under section 2503(b),

            to the extent such interests are continuously held by members of such family (other than the decedent’s spouse) between the date of the gift and the date of the decedent’s death.

    (c) __Adjusted gross estate__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “adjusted gross estate” means the value of the gross estate—

        (1) reduced by any amount deductible under paragraph (3) or (4) of section 2053(a), and

        (2)

         increased by the excess of—

            (A)

             the sum of—

                (i) the amount of gifts determined under subsection (b)(3), plus

                (iii) the amount of other gifts (not included under clause (i) or (ii)) from the decedent within 3 years of such date, other than gifts to members of the decedent’s family otherwise excluded under section 2503(b), over

            (B) the sum of the amounts described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) which are otherwise includible in the gross estate.

        For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary may provide that de minimis gifts to persons other than members of the decedent’s family shall not be taken into account.

    (d) __Adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests__ 

    For purposes of this section, the adjusted value of any qualified family-owned business interest is the value of such interest for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to this section), reduced by the excess of—

        (1) any amount deductible under paragraph (3) or (4) of section 2053(a), over

        (2)

         the sum of—

            (A) any indebtedness on any qualified residence of the decedent the interest on which is deductible under section 163(h)(3), plus

            (B) any indebtedness to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the proceeds of such indebtedness were used for the payment of educational and medical expenses of the decedent, the decedent’s spouse, or the decedent’s dependents (within the meaning of section 152, determined without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof), plus

            (C) any indebtedness not described in subparagraph (A) or (B), to the extent such indebtedness does not exceed $10,000.

    (e) __Qualified family-owned business interest__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified family-owned business interest” means—

            (A) an interest as a proprietor in a trade or business carried on as a proprietorship, or

            (B)

             an interest in an entity carrying on a trade or business, if—

                (i)

            For purposes of the preceding sentence, a decedent shall be treated as engaged in a trade or business if any member of the decedent’s family is engaged in such trade or business.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

        Such term shall not include—

            (A) any interest in a trade or business the principal place of business of which is not located in the United States,

            (B) any interest in an entity, if the stock or debt of such entity or a controlled group (as defined in section 267(f)(1)) of which such entity was a member was readily tradable on an established securities market or secondary market (as defined by the Secretary) at any time within 3 years of the date of the decedent’s death,

            (C) any interest in a trade or business not described in section 542(c)(2), if more than 35 percent of the adjusted ordinary gross income of such trade or business for the taxable year which includes the date of the decedent’s death would qualify as personal holding company income (as defined in section 543(a) without regard to paragraph (2)(B) thereof) if such trade or business were a corporation,

            (D)

             that portion of an interest in a trade or business that is attributable to—

                (i) cash or marketable securities, or both, in excess of the reasonably expected day-to-day working capital needs of such trade or business, and

                (ii) any other assets of the trade or business (other than assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business described in section 542(c)(2)), which produce, or are held for the production of, personal holding company income (as defined in subparagraph (C)) or income described in section 954(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (A) thereof and by substituting “trade or business” for “controlled foreign corporation”).

            In the case of a lease of property on a net cash basis by the decedent to a member of the decedent’s family, income from such lease shall not be treated as personal holding company income for purposes of subparagraph (C), and such property shall not be treated as an asset described in subparagraph (D)(ii), if such income and property would not be so treated if the lessor had engaged directly in the activities engaged in by the lessee with respect to such property.

            (A) __Ownership of entities__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)—

                (i) __Corporations__

                    Ownership of a partnership shall be determined by the owning of the appropriate percentage of the capital interest in such partnership.

            (B) __Ownership of tiered entities__ 

            For purposes of this section, if by reason of holding an interest in a trade or business, a decedent, any member of the decedent’s family, any qualified heir, or any member of any qualified heir’s family is treated as holding an interest in any other trade or business—

                (i) such ownership interest in the other trade or business shall be disregarded in determining if the ownership interest in the first trade or business is a qualified family-owned business interest, and

                (ii) this section shall be applied separately in determining if such interest in any other trade or business is a qualified family-owned business interest.

            (C) __Individual ownership rules__ 

                For purposes of this section, an interest owned, directly or indirectly, by or for an entity described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be considered as being owned proportionately by or for the entity’s shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.

        (2) __Additional estate tax__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amount of the additional estate tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall be equal to—

                (i) the applicable percentage of the adjusted tax difference attributable to the qualified family-owned business interest, plus

                (ii) interest on the amount determined under clause (i) at the underpayment rate established under section 6621 for the period beginning on the date the estate tax liability was due under this chapter and ending on the date such additional estate tax is due.
