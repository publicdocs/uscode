## § 2612. Taxable termination; taxable distribution; direct skip

    (a) __Taxable termination__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        For purposes of this chapter, the term “taxable termination” means the termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or otherwise) of an interest in property held in a trust unless—

            (A) immediately after such termination, a non-skip person has an interest in such property, or

            (B) at no time after such termination may a distribution (including distributions on termination) be made from such trust to a skip person.

        (2) __Certain partial terminations treated as taxable__ 

            If, upon the termination of an interest in property held in trust by reason of the death of a lineal descendant of the transferor, a specified portion of the trust’s assets are distributed to 1 or more skip persons (or 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a taxable termination with respect to such portion of the trust property.

    (b) __Taxable distribution__ 

        For purposes of this chapter, the term “taxable distribution” means any distribution from a trust to a skip person (other than a taxable termination or a direct skip).

    (c) __Direct skip__ 

    For purposes of this chapter—

        (1) __In general__ 

            The term “direct skip” means a transfer subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a skip person.

        (2) __Look-thru rules not to apply__ 

            Solely for purposes of determining whether any transfer to a trust is a direct skip, the rules of section 2651(f)(2) shall not apply.

(Added [Pub. L. 94–455, title XX, § 2006(a)][/us/pl/94/455/s2006/a], Oct. 4, 1976, [90 Stat. 1883][/us/stat/90/1883]; amended [Pub. L. 99–514, title XIV, § 1431(a)][/us/pl/99/514/s1431/a], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2719][/us/stat/100/2719]; [Pub. L. 100–647, title I, § 1014(g)(5)(B)][/us/pl/100/647/s1014/g/5/B], (7), (15), Nov. 10, 1988, [102 Stat. 3564–3566][/us/stat/102/3564-3566]; [Pub. L. 105–34, title V, § 511(b)][/us/pl/105/34/s511/b], Aug. 5, 1997, [111 Stat. 861][/us/stat/111/861].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1997—Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 105–34, § 511(b)(2)][/us/pl/105/34/s511/b/2], substituted “section 2651(f)(2)” for “section 2651(e)(2)”.

    [Pub. L. 105–34, § 511(b)(1)][/us/pl/105/34/s511/b/1], redesignated par. (3) as (2) and struck out heading and text of former par. (2). Text read as follows: “For purposes of determining whether any transfer is a direct skip, if—

    “(A) an individual is a grandchild of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), and

    “(B) as of the time of the transfer, the parent of such individual who is a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) is dead,

    such individual shall be treated as if such individual were a child of the transferor and all of that grandchild’s children shall be treated as if they were grandchildren of the transferor. In the case of lineal descendants below a grandchild, the preceding sentence may be reapplied. If any transfer of property to a trust would be a direct skip but for this paragraph, any generation assignment under this paragraph shall apply also for purposes of applying this chapter to transfers from the portion of the trust attributable to such property.”

    Subsec. (c)(3). [Pub. L. 105–34, § 511(b)(1)][/us/pl/105/34/s511/b/1], redesignated par. (3) as (2).

    1988—Subsec. (a)(2). [Pub. L. 100–647, § 1014(g)(15)][/us/pl/100/647/s1014/g/15], amended par. (2) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (2) read as follows: “If, upon the termination of an interest in property held in a trust, a specified portion of the trust assets are distributed to skip persons who are lineal descendants of the holder of such interest (or to 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a taxable termination with respect to such portion of the trust property.”

    Subsec. (c)(2). [Pub. L. 100–647, § 1014(g)(7)][/us/pl/100/647/s1014/g/7], in closing provisions, inserted at end “If any transfer of property to a trust would be a direct skip but for this paragraph, any generation assignment under this paragraph shall apply also for purposes of applying this chapter to transfers from the portion of the trust attributable to such property.”

    Subsec. (c)(3). [Pub. L. 100–647, § 1014(g)(5)(B)][/us/pl/100/647/s1014/g/5/B], added par. (3).

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] amended section generally, substituting provisions covering definition and application of “taxable termination”, “taxable distribution”, and “direct skip” for former provisions which indicated who the “deemed transferor” would be for purposes of this chapter and that, for purposes of determining the person deemed the transferor, a parent related to the grantor of a trust by blood or adoption was to be deemed more closely related than a parent related to a grantor by marriage.

 __Effective Date of 1997 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 105–34, title V, § 511(c)][/us/pl/105/34/s511/c], Aug. 5, 1997, [111 Stat. 861][/us/stat/111/861], provided that:
