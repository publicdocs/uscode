## § 2503. Taxable gifts

    (a) __General definition__ 

        The term “taxable gifts” means the total amount of gifts made during the calendar year, less the deductions provided in subchapter C (section 2522 and following).

    (b) __Exclusions from gifts__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of gifts (other than gifts of future interests in property) made to any person by the donor during the calendar year, the first $10,000 of such gifts to such person shall not, for purposes of subsection (a), be included in the total amount of gifts made during such year. Where there has been a transfer to any person of a present interest in property, the possibility that such interest may be diminished by the exercise of a power shall be disregarded in applying this subsection, if no part of such interest will at any time pass to any other person.

        (2) __Inflation adjustment__ 

        In the case of gifts made in a calendar year after 1998, the $10,000 amount contained in paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) $10,000, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting “calendar year 1997” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

            If any amount as adjusted under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $1,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1,000.

    (c) __Transfer for the benefit of minor__ 

    No part of a gift to an individual who has not attained the age of 21 years on the date of such transfer shall be considered a gift of a future interest in property for purposes of subsection (b) if the property and the income therefrom—

        (1) may be expended by, or for the benefit of, the donee before his attaining the age of 21 years, and

        (2)

         will to the extent not so expended—

            (A) pass to the donee on his attaining the age of 21 years, and

            (B) in the event the donee dies before attaining the age of 21 years, be payable to the estate of the donee or as he may appoint under a general power of appointment as defined in section 2514(c).

            (A) as tuition to an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) for the education or training of such individual, or

            (B) to any person who provides medical care (as defined in section 213(d)) with respect to such individual as payment for such medical care.

    (f) __Waiver of certain pension rights__ 

        If any individual waives, before the death of a participant, any survivor benefit, or right to such benefit, under section 401(a)(11) or 417, such waiver shall not be treated as a transfer of property by gift for purposes of this chapter.

    (g) __Treatment of certain loans of artworks__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this subtitle, any loan of a qualified work of art shall not be treated as a transfer (and the value of such qualified work of art shall be determined as if such loan had not been made) if—

            (A) such loan is to an organization described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(c) (other than a private foundation), and

            (B) the use of such work by such organization is related to the purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501.

        (2) __Definitions__
