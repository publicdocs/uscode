## § 2032A. Valuation of certain farm, etc., real property

    (a) __Value based on use under which property qualifies__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        If—

            (A) the decedent was (at the time of his death) a citizen or resident of the United States, and

            (B) the executor elects the application of this section and files the agreement referred to in subsection (d)(2),

            then, for purposes of this chapter, the value of qualified real property shall be its value for the use under which it qualifies, under subsection (b), as qualified real property.

        (2) __Limitation on aggregate reduction in fair market value__ 

            The aggregate decrease in the value of qualified real property taken into account for purposes of this chapter which results from the application of paragraph (1) with respect to any decedent shall not exceed $750,000.

        (3) __Inflation adjustment__ 

        In the case of estates of decedents dying in a calendar year after 1998, the $750,000 amount contained in paragraph (2) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) $750,000, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting “calendar year 1997” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

            If any amount as adjusted under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $10,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10,000.

    (b) __Qualified real property__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified real property” means real property located in the United States which was acquired from or passed from the decedent to a qualified heir of the decedent and which, on the date of the decedent’s death, was being used for a qualified use by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family, but only if—

            (A)

             50 percent or more of the adjusted value of the gross estate consists of the adjusted value of real or personal property which—

                (i) on the date of the decedent’s death, was being used for a qualified use by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family, and

                (ii) was acquired from or passed from the decedent to a qualified heir of the decedent.

            (B) 25 percent or more of the adjusted value of the gross estate consists of the adjusted value of real property which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (C),

            (C)

             during the 8-year period ending on the date of the decedent’s death there have been periods aggregating 5 years or more during which—

                (i) such real property was owned by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family and used for a qualified use by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family, and

                (ii) there was material participation by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s family in the operation of the farm or other business, and

            (D) such real property is designated in the agreement referred to in subsection (d)(2).

        (2) __Qualified use__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified use” means the devotion of the property to any of the following:

            (A) use as a farm for farming purposes, or

            (B) use in a trade or business other than the trade or business of farming.

        (3) __Adjusted value__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “adjusted value” means—

            (A) in the case of the gross estate, the value of the gross estate for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to this section), reduced by any amounts allowable as a deduction under paragraph (4) of section 2053(a), or

            (B) in the case of any real or personal property, the value of such property for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to this section), reduced by any amounts allowable as a deduction in respect of such property under paragraph (4) of section 2053(a).

        (4) __Decedents who are retired or disabled__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If, on the date of the decedent’s death, the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) with respect to the decedent for any property are not met, and the decedent—

                (i) was receiving old-age benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for a continuous period ending on such date, or

                (ii) was disabled for a continuous period ending on such date,

                then paragraph (1)(C)(ii) shall be applied with respect to such property by substituting “the date on which the longer of such continuous periods began” for “the date of the decedent’s death” in paragraph (1)(C).

            (B) __Disabled defined__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual shall be disabled if such individual has a mental or physical impairment which renders him unable to materially participate in the operation of the farm or other business.

            (C) __Coordination with recapture__ 

                For purposes of subsection (c)(6)(B)(i), if the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) are met with respect to any decedent by reason of subparagraph (A), the period ending on the date on which the continuous period taken into account under subparagraph (A) began shall be treated as the period immediately before the decedent’s death.

        (5) __Special rules for surviving spouses__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If property is qualified real property with respect to a decedent (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “first decedent”) and such property was acquired from or passed from the first decedent to the surviving spouse of the first decedent, for purposes of applying this subsection and subsection (c) in the case of the estate of such surviving spouse, active management of the farm or other business by the surviving spouse shall be treated as material participation by such surviving spouse in the operation of such farm or business.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

                For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of whether property is qualified real property with respect to the first decedent shall be made without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) and without regard to whether an election under this section was made.

            (C) __Coordination with paragraph (4)__ 

                In any case in which to do so will enable the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to the surviving spouse, this subsection and subsection (c) shall be applied by taking into account any application of paragraph (4).

    (c) __Tax treatment of dispositions and failures to use for qualified use__ 

        (1) __Imposition of additional estate tax__ 

        If, within 10 years after the decedent’s death and before the death of the qualified heir—

            (A) the qualified heir disposes of any interest in qualified real property (other than by a disposition to a member of his family), or

            (B) the qualified heir ceases to use for the qualified use the qualified real property which was acquired (or passed) from the decedent,

            then, there is hereby imposed an additional estate tax.

        (2) __Amount of additional tax__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any interest shall be the amount equal to the lesser of—

                (i) the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest, or

                (ii) the excess of the amount realized with respect to the interest (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm’s length, the fair market value of the interest) over the value of the interest determined under subsection (a).

            (B) __Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjusted tax difference attributable to an interest is the amount which bears the same ratio to the adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate (determined under subparagraph (C)) as—

                (i) the excess of the value of such interest for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to subsection (a)) over the value of such interest determined under subsection (a), bears to

                (ii) a similar excess determined for all qualified real property.

            (C) __Adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term “adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate” means the excess of what would have been the estate tax liability but for subsection (a) over the estate tax liability. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “estate tax liability” means the tax imposed by section 2001 reduced by the credits allowable against such tax.

            (D) __Partial dispositions__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, where the qualified heir disposes of a portion of the interest acquired by (or passing to) such heir (or a predecessor qualified heir) or there is a cessation of use of such a portion—

                (i) the value determined under subsection (a) taken into account under subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to such portion shall be its pro rata share of such value of such interest, and

                (ii) the adjusted tax difference attributable to the interest taken into account with respect to the transaction involving the second or any succeeding portion shall be reduced by the amount of the tax imposed by this subsection with respect to all prior transactions involving portions of such interest.

            (E) __Special rule for disposition of timber__ 

            In the case of qualified woodland to which an election under subsection (e)(13)(A) applies, if the qualified heir disposes of (or severs) any standing timber on such qualified woodland—

                (i) such disposition (or severance) shall be treated as a disposition of a portion of the interest of the qualified heir in such property, and

                (ii)

                 the amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to such disposition shall be an amount equal to the lesser of—

                    (I) the amount realized on such disposition (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm’s length, the fair market value of the portion of the interest disposed or severed), or

                    (II) the amount of additional tax determined under this paragraph (without regard to this subparagraph) if the entire interest of the qualified heir in the qualified woodland had been disposed of, less the sum of the amount of the additional tax imposed with respect to all prior transactions involving such woodland to which this subparagraph applied.

                For purposes of the preceding sentence, the disposition of a right to sever shall be treated as the disposition of the standing timber. The amount of additional tax imposed under paragraph (1) in any case in which a qualified heir disposes of his entire interest in the qualified woodland shall be reduced by any amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to such woodland.

        (3) __Only 1 additional tax imposed with respect to any 1 portion__ 

            In the case of an interest acquired from (or passing from) any decedent, if subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) applies to any portion of an interest, subparagraph (B) or (A), as the case may be, of paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the same portion of such interest.

        (4) __Due date__ 

            The additional tax imposed by this subsection shall become due and payable on the day which is 6 months after the date of the disposition or cessation referred to in paragraph (1).

        (5) __Liability for tax; furnishing of bond__ 

            The qualified heir shall be personally liable for the additional tax imposed by this subsection with respect to his interest unless the heir has furnished bond which meets the requirements of subsection (e)(11).

        (6) __Cessation of qualified use__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), real property shall cease to be used for the qualified use if—

            (A) such property ceases to be used for the qualified use set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(2) under which the property qualified under subsection (b), or

            (B)

             during any period of 8 years ending after the date of the decedent’s death and before the date of the death of the qualified heir, there had been periods aggregating more than 3 years during which—

                (i) in the case of periods during which the property was held by the decedent, there was no material participation by the decedent or any member of his family in the operation of the farm or other business, and

                (ii) in the case of periods during which the property was held by any qualified heir, there was no material participation by such qualified heir or any member of his family in the operation of the farm or other business.

        (7) __Special rules__ 

            (A) __No tax if use begins within 2 years__ 

            If the date on which the qualified heir begins to use the qualified real property (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the commencement date) is before the date 2 years after the decedent’s death—

                (i) no tax shall be imposed under paragraph (1) by reason of the failure by the qualified heir to so use such property before the commencement date, and

                (ii) the 10-year period under paragraph (1) shall be extended by the period after the decedent’s death and before the commencement date.

            (B) __Active management by eligible qualified heir treated as material participation__

                (i) an eligible qualified heir, or

                (ii) a fiduciary of an eligible qualified heir described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (C),

                shall be treated as material participation by such eligible qualified heir in the operation of such farm or business. In the case of an eligible qualified heir described in clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (C), the preceding sentence shall apply only during periods during which such heir meets the requirements of such clause.

            (C) __Eligible qualified heir__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “eligible qualified heir” means a qualified heir who—

                (i) is the surviving spouse of the decedent,

                (ii) has not attained the age of 21,

            (E) __Certain rents treated as qualified use__ 

                For purposes of this subsection, a surviving spouse or lineal descendant of the decedent shall not be treated as failing to use qualified real property in a qualified use solely because such spouse or descendant rents such property to a member of the family of such spouse or descendant on a net cash basis. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a legally adopted child of an individual shall be treated as the child of such individual by blood.

        (8) __Qualified conservation contribution is not a disposition__ 

            A qualified conservation contribution (as defined in section 170(h)) by gift or otherwise shall not be deemed a disposition under subsection (c)(1)(A).

            The agreement referred to in this paragraph is a written agreement signed by each person in being who has an interest (whether or not in possession) in any property designated in such agreement consenting to the application of subsection (c) with respect to such property.

        (3) __Modification of election and agreement to be permitted__ 

        The Secretary shall prescribe procedures which provide that in any case in which the executor makes an election under paragraph (1) (and submits the agreement referred to in paragraph (2)) within the time prescribed therefor, but—

            (A) the notice of election, as filed, does not contain all required information, or

            (B) signatures of 1 or more persons required to enter into the agreement described in paragraph (2) are not included on the agreement as filed, or the agreement does not contain all required information,

            the executor will have a reasonable period of time (not exceeding 90 days) after notification of such failures to provide such information or signatures.

        (7) __Method of valuing farms__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of a farm for farming purposes shall be determined by dividing—

                (i) the excess of the average annual gross cash rental for comparable land used for farming purposes and located in the locality of such farm over the average annual State and local real estate taxes for such comparable land, by

                (ii) the average annual effective interest rate for all new Federal Land Bank loans.

                For purposes of the preceding sentence, each average annual computation shall be made on the basis of the 5 most recent calendar years ending before the date of the decedent’s death.

            (B) __Value based on net share rental in certain cases__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    If there is no comparable land from which the average annual gross cash rental may be determined but there is comparable land from which the average net share rental may be determined, subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied by substituting “average annual net share rental” for “average annual gross cash rental”.

                (ii) __Net share rental__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “net share rental” means the excess of—

        (8) __Method of valuing closely held business interests, etc.__ 

        In any case to which paragraph (7)(A) does not apply, the following factors shall apply in determining the value of any qualified real property:

            (A) The capitalization of income which the property can be expected to yield for farming or closely held business purposes over a reasonable period of time under prudent management using traditional cropping patterns for the area, taking into account soil capacity, terrain configuration, and similar factors,

            If the decedent and his surviving spouse at any time held qualified real property as community property, the interest of the surviving spouse in such property shall be taken into account under this section to the extent necessary to provide a result under this section with respect to such property which is consistent with the result which would have obtained under this section if such property had not been community property.

        (11) __Bond in lieu of personal liability__ 

            If the qualified heir makes written application to the Secretary for determination of the maximum amount of the additional tax which may be imposed by subsection (c) with respect to the qualified heir’s interest, the Secretary (as soon as possible, and in any event within 1 year after the making of such application) shall notify the heir of such maximum amount. The qualified heir, on furnishing a bond in such amount and for such period as may be required, shall be discharged from personal liability for any additional tax imposed by subsection (c) and shall be entitled to a receipt or writing showing such discharge.

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of any qualified replacement property, any period during which there was ownership, qualified use, or material participation with respect to the replaced property by the decedent or any member of his family shall be treated as a period during which there was such ownership, use, or material participation (as the case may be) with respect to the qualified replacement property.

            (B) __Limitation__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the extent that the fair market value of the qualified replacement property (as of the date of its acquisition) exceeds the fair market value of the replaced property (as of the date of its disposition).

        (2) such additional tax may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.

    (g) __Application of this section and section 6324B to interests in partnerships, corporations, and trusts__ 

        The Secretary shall prescribe regulations setting forth the application of this section and section 6324B in the case of an interest in a partnership, corporation, or trust which, with respect to the decedent, is an interest in a closely held business (within the meaning of paragraph (1) of section 6166(b)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an interest in a discretionary trust all the beneficiaries of which are qualified heirs shall be treated as a present interest.

            (A) __In general__ 

            If there is an involuntary conversion of an interest in qualified real property—

            (B) __Amount of tax where there is not complete reinvestment__ 

            The amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to any involuntary conversion is the amount of the tax which (but for this subsection) would have been imposed on such conversion reduced by an amount which—

                (i) bears the same ratio to such tax, as

                (ii) the cost of the qualified replacement property bears to the amount realized on the conversion.

        (2) __Treatment of replacement property__ 

        For purposes of subsection (c)—

            (A) any qualified replacement property shall be treated in the same manner as if it were a portion of the interest in qualified real property which was involuntarily converted; except that with respect to such qualified replacement property the 10-year period under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) shall be extended by any period, beyond the 2-year period referred to in section 1033(a)(2)(B)(i), during which the qualified heir was allowed to replace the qualified real property,

            (B) any tax imposed by subsection (c) on the involuntary conversion shall be treated as a tax imposed on a partial disposition, and
