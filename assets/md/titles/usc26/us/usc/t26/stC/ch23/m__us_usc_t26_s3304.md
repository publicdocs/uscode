            (C) nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit deducting an amount from unemployment compensation otherwise payable to an individual and using the amount so deducted to pay for health insurance, or the withholding of Federal, State, or local individual income tax, if the individual elected to have such deduction made and such deduction was made under a program approved by the Secretary of Labor;

            (D) amounts shall be deducted from unemployment benefits and used to repay overpayments as provided in section 303(g) of the Social Security Act;

        (5)

            (A) if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;

            (C) if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization;

        (6)

            (A)

             compensation is payable on the basis of service to which section 3309(a)(1) applies, in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to such law; except that—

                (i) with respect to services in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution to which section 3309(a)(1) applies, compensation shall not be payable based on such services for any week commencing during the period between two successive academic years or terms (or, when an agreement provides instead for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, during such period) to any individual if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years (or terms) and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that such individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second of such academic years or terms,

                (ii)

                 with respect to services in any other capacity for an educational institution to which section 3309(a)(1) applies—

                    (I) compensation payable on the basis of such services may be denied to any individual for any week which commences during a period between 2 successive academic years or terms if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the second of such academic years or terms, except that

                    (II) if compensation is denied to any individual for any week under subclause (I) and such individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the educational institution for the second of such academic years or terms, such individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of the compensation for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for compensation and for which compensation was denied solely by reason of subclause (I),

                (iii) with respect to any services described in clause (i) or (ii), compensation payable on the basis of such services shall be denied to any individual for any week which commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if such individual performs such services in the period immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess, and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the period immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess,

                (iv) with respect to any services described in clause (i) or (ii), compensation payable on the basis of services in any such capacity shall be denied as specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) to any individual who performed such services in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency, and for this purpose the term “educational service agency” means a governmental agency or governmental entity which is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing such services to one or more educational institutions,

                (vi) with respect to services described in clause (ii), clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be applied by substituting “may be denied” for “shall be denied”, and

        (8) compensation shall not be denied to an individual for any week because he is in training with the approval of the State agency (or because of the application, to any such week in training, of State law provisions relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work);

        (9)

            (A) compensation shall not be denied or reduced to an individual solely because he files a claim in another State (or a contiguous country with which the United States has an agreement with respect to unemployment compensation) or because he resides in another State (or such a contiguous country) at the time he files a claim for unemployment compensation;

            (B) the State shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual’s wages and employment covered under the State law with his wages and employment covered under the unemployment compensation law of other States which are approved by the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the State unemployment compensation agencies as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of compensation in such situations. Any such arrangement shall include provisions for (i) applying the base period of a single State law to a claim involving the combining of an individual’s wages and employment covered under two or more State laws, and (ii) avoiding duplicate use of wages and employment by reason of such combining;

        (10) compensation shall not be denied to any individual by reason of cancellation of wage credits or total reduction of his benefit rights for any cause other than discharge for misconduct connected with his work, fraud in connection with a claim for compensation, or receipt of disqualifying income;

        (12) no person shall be denied compensation under such State law solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy;

        (13) compensation shall not be payable to any individual on the basis of any services, substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate, for any week which commences during the period between two successive sport seasons (or similar periods) if such individual performed such services in the first of such seasons (or similar periods) and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the later of such seasons (or similar periods);

        (14)

            (A) compensation shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act),

            (B) any data or information required of individuals applying for compensation to determine whether compensation is not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for compensation, and

            (C) in the case of an individual whose application for compensation would otherwise be approved, no determination by the State agency that compensation to such individual is not payable because of his alien status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence;

        (15)

            (A)

             subject to subparagraph (B), the amount of compensation payable to an individual for any week which begins after March 31, 1980, and which begins in a period with respect to which such individual is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or any other similar periodic payment which is based on the previous work of such individual shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other payment, which is reasonably attributable to such week except that—

                (i)

                 the requirements of this paragraph shall apply to any pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment only if—

                    (I) such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar payment is under a plan maintained (or contributed to) by a base period employer or chargeable employer (as determined under applicable law), and

                    (II) in the case of such a payment not made under the Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law), services performed for such employer by the individual after the beginning of the base period (or remuneration for such services) affect eligibility for, or increase the amount of, such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar payment, and

                (ii) the State law may provide for limitations on the amount of any such a reduction to take into account contributions made by the individual for the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment, and

            (B) the amount of compensation shall not be reduced on account of any payments of governmental or other pensions, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar payments which are not includible in the gross income of the individual for the taxable year in which it was paid because it was part of a rollover distribution;

        (16)

            (A) wage information contained in the records of the agency administering the State law which is necessary (as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in regulations) for purposes of determining an individual’s eligibility for assistance, or the amount of such assistance, under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, shall be made available to a State or political subdivision thereof when such information is specifically requested by such State or political subdivision for such purposes,

            (B) wage and unemployment compensation information contained in the records of such agency shall be furnished to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in accordance with regulations promulgated by such Secretary) as necessary for the purposes of the National Directory of New Hires established under section 453(i) of the Social Security Act, and

        (17) any interest required to be paid on advances under title XII of the Social Security Act shall be paid in a timely manner and shall not be paid, directly or indirectly (by an equivalent reduction in State unemployment taxes or otherwise) by such State from amounts in such State’s unemployment fund;

        (18) Federal individual income tax from unemployment compensation is to be deducted and withheld if an individual receiving such compensation voluntarily requests such deduction and withholding; and

        (19) all the rights, privileges, or immunities conferred by such law or by acts done pursuant thereto shall exist subject to the power of the legislature to amend or repeal such law at any time.

    (b) __Notification__ 

        The Secretary of Labor shall, upon approving such law, notify the governor of the State of his approval.

    (c) __Certification__ 

        On October 31 of each taxable year the Secretary of Labor shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury each State whose law he has previously approved, except that he shall not certify any State which, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds has amended its law so that it no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a) or has with respect to the 12-month period ending on such October 31 failed to comply substantially with any such provision in such subsection. No finding of a failure to comply substantially with any provision in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) shall be based on an application or interpretation of State law (1) until all administrative review provided for under the laws of the State has been exhausted, or (2) with respect to which the time for judicial review provided by the laws of the State has not expired, or (3) with respect to which any judicial review is pending. On October 31 of any taxable year, the Secretary of Labor shall not certify any State which, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds has failed to amend its law so that it contains each of the provisions required by law to be included therein (including provisions relating to the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (or any amendments thereto) as required under subsection (a)(11)), or has, with respect to the twelve-month period ending on such October 31, failed to comply substantially with any such provision.

    (d) __Notice of noncertification__ 

        If at any time the Secretary of Labor has reason to believe that a State whose law he has previously approved may not be certified under subsection (c), he shall promptly so notify the governor of such State.

    (e) __Change of law during 12-month period__ 

    Whenever—

        (1) any provision of this section, section 3302, or section 3303 refers to a 12-month period ending on October 31 of a year, and

        (2) the law applicable to one portion of such period differs from the law applicable to another portion of such period,

        then such provision shall be applied by taking into account for each such portion the law applicable to such portion.

    (f) __Definition of institution of higher education__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a)(6), the term “institution of higher education” means an educational institution in any State which—

        (1) admits as regular students only individuals having a certificate of graduation from a high school, or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate;

        (2) is legally authorized within such State to provide a program of education beyond high school;

 __“__  __federal-state agreements__ 

    “Sec. 4001. (a) In General.—Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this title with the Secretary of Labor (in this title referred to as the ‘Secretary’). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this title may, upon providing 30 days’ written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.

    “(b) Provisions of Agreement.—Any agreement under subsection (a) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who—

    “(1) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year that ended before May 1, 2007);

    “(2) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;

    “(3) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and

    “(4) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.

    “(c) Exhaustion of Benefits.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), an individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual’s rights to regular compensation under a State law when—

    “(1) no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to such individual based on employment or wages during such individual’s base period; or

    “(2) such individual’s rights to such compensation have been terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.

    “(d) Weekly Benefit Amount, Etc.—For purposes of any agreement under this title—

    “(1) the amount of emergency unemployment compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment shall be equal to the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) payable to such individual during such individual’s benefit year under the State law for a week of total unemployment;

    “(2) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof (including terms and conditions relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall apply to claims for emergency unemployment compensation and the payment thereof, except—

    “(A) that an individual shall not be eligible for emergency unemployment compensation under this title unless, in the base period with respect to which the individual exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 weeks of full-time insured employment or the equivalent in insured wages, as determined under the provisions of the State law implementing section 202(a)(5) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 \[[Pub. L. 91–373][/us/pl/91/373]\] ([26 U.S.C. 3304][/us/usc/t26/s3304] note); and

    “(B) where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this title or with the regulations or operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this title; and

    “(3) the maximum amount of emergency unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom an emergency unemployment compensation account is established under section 4002 shall not exceed the amount established in such account for such individual.

    “(e) Coordination Rule.—An agreement under this section shall apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any emergency unemployment compensation under section 4002, as amended by the Unemployment Benefits Extension Act of 2012 \[subtitle B of title II of [Pub. L. 112–96][/us/pl/112/96]\], for which the individual is concurrently eligible.

    “(f) Unauthorized Aliens Ineligible.—A State shall require as a condition of eligibility for emergency unemployment compensation under this Act \[probably means “this title”\] that each alien who receives such compensation must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as defined for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ([26 U.S.C. 3301][/us/usc/t26/s3301] et seq.). In determining whether an alien meets the requirements of this subsection, a State must follow the procedures provided in section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1320b–7(d)][/us/usc/t42/s1320b–7/d]).

    “(g) Nonreduction Rule.—An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that—

    “(1) the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement occurring on or after June 2, 2010 (determined disregarding any additional amounts attributable to the modification described in section 2002(b)(1) of the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act, as contained in [Public Law 111–5][/us/pl/111/5] ([26 U.S.C. 3304][/us/usc/t26/s3304] note; [123 Stat. 438][/us/stat/123/438])), will be less than

    “(2) the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on June 2, 2010.

    “(h) Actively Seeking Work.—

L. 111–92][/us/pl/111/92]\]), if such individual claimed extended compensation for at least 1 week of unemployment after the exhaustion of emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) (as such subsection was in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this subsection \[Nov. 6, 2009\]).

    “(2) Coordination with tiers ii, iii, and iv.—If a State determines that implementation of the increased entitlement to second-tier emergency unemployment compensation by reason of the amendments made by section 2 of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 \[[Pub.

If a State makes the election under the preceding sentence, then, for purposes of determining whether an account may be augmented for fourth-tier emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (e), such State shall treat the date of exhaustion of such increased second-tier emergency unemployment compensation as the date of exhaustion of third-tier emergency unemployment compensation, if such date is later than the date of exhaustion of the third-tier emergency unemployment compensation.

    “(g) Coordination of Emergency Unemployment Compensation With Regular Compensation.—

    “(1) If—

    “(A) an individual has been determined to be entitled to emergency unemployment compensation with respect to a benefit year,

    “(B) that benefit year has expired,

    “(C) that individual has remaining entitlement to emergency unemployment compensation with respect to that benefit year, and

    “(D) that individual would qualify for a new benefit year in which the weekly benefit amount of regular compensation is at least either $100 or 25 percent less than the individual’s weekly benefit amount in the benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A),

    then the State shall determine eligibility for compensation as provided in paragraph (2).

    “(2) For individuals described in paragraph (1), the State shall determine whether the individual is to be paid emergency unemployment compensation or regular compensation for a week of unemployment using one of the following methods:

    “(A) The State shall, if permitted by State law, establish a new benefit year, but defer the payment of regular compensation with respect to that new benefit year until exhaustion of all emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in paragraph (1)(A);

    “(B) The State shall, if permitted by State law, defer the establishment of a new benefit year (which uses all the wages and employment which would have been used to establish a benefit year but for the application of this paragraph), until exhaustion of all emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in paragraph(1)(A);

    “(C) The State shall pay, if permitted by State law—

    “(i) regular compensation equal to the weekly benefit amount established under the new benefit year, and

    “(ii) emergency unemployment compensation equal to the difference between that weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit amount for the expired benefit year; or

    “(D) The State shall determine rights to emergency unemployment compensation without regard to any rights to regular compensation if the individual elects to not file a claim for regular compensation under the new benefit year.

 __“__  __payments to states having agreements for the payment of emergency unemployment compensation__

    “(2) Opportunity for hearing.—No repayment shall be required, and no deduction shall be made, until a determination has been made, notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair hearing has been given to the individual, and the determination has become final.

>     “(a)

>      \[State Law Requirements\] (1) For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \[formerly I.R.C. 1954\], a State law shall provide the payment of extended compensation shall be made, for any week of unemployment which begins in the individual’s eligibility period, to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law and who have no rights to regular compensation with respect to such week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law and are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall have exhausted his rights to regular compensation under a State law (A) when no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to him based on employment or wages during his base period, or (B) when his rights to such compensation have terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.

>         “(2) Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall apply to claims for extended compensation and to the payment thereof.

>         “(3)

>             (A)

>              Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation under this Act \[see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under [section 3311 of this title][/us/usc/t26/s3311]\] shall not be made to any individual for any week of unemployment in his eligibility period—

>                 “(i) during which he fails to accept any offer of suitable work (as defined in subparagraph (c) \[probably means subpar. (C)\]) or fails to apply for any suitable work to which he was referred by the State agency; or

>                 “(ii)

>                  during which he fails to actively engage in seeking work, unless such individual is not actively engaged in seeking work because such individual is, as determined in accordance with State law—

>                     “(I) before any court of the United States or any State pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty (as such term may be defined by the Secretary of Labor), or

>                     “(II) hospitalized for treatment of an emergency or a life-threatening condition (as such term may be defined by such Secretary),

>                     if such exemptions in clauses (I) and (II) apply to recipients of regular benefits, and the State chooses to apply such exemptions for recipients of extended benefits.

>             “(B)

>              If any individual is ineligible for extended compensation for any week by reason of a failure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), the individual shall be ineligible to receive extended compensation for any week which begins during a period which—

>                 “(i) begins with the week following the week in which such failure occurs, and

>                 “(ii) does not end until such individual has been employed during at least 4 weeks which begin after such failure and the total of the remuneration earned by the individual for being so employed is not less than the product of 4 multiplied by the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(c) \[probably means subsec. (b)(1)(C)\]) for his benefit year.

>             “(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘suitable work’ means, with respect to any individual, any work which is within such individual’s capabilities; except that, if the individual furnishes evidence satisfactory to the State agency that such individual’s prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the applicable State law.

>             “(D)

>              Extended compensation shall not be denied under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) to any individual for any week by reason of a failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work—

>                 “(i)

>                  if the gross average weekly remuneration payable to such individual for the position does not exceed the sum of—

>                     “(I) the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C)) for his benefit year, plus

>                     “(II) the amount (if any) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits (as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to such individual for such week;

>                 “(ii) if the position was not offered to such individual in writing and was not listed with the State employment service;

>                 “(iii) if such failure would not result in a denial of compensation under the provisions of the applicable State law to the extent that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (E); or

>                 “(iv)

>                  if the position pays wages less than the higher of—

>                     “(I) the minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \[[29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)][/us/usc/t29/s206/a/1]\], without regard to any exemption; or

>                     “(II) any applicable State or local minimum wage.

>             “(E)

>              For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be treated as actively engaged in seeking work during any week if—

>                 “(i) the individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during such week, and

>                 “(ii) the individual provides tangible evidence to the State agency that he has engaged in such an effort during such week.

>             “(F) For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a State law shall provide for referring applicants for benefits under this Act \[see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under [section 3311 of this title][/us/usc/t26/s3311]\] to any suitable work to which clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subparagraph (D) would not apply.

>         “(4) No provision of State law which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leaving employment, being discharged for misconduct, or refusing suitable employment shall apply for purposes of determining eligibility for extended compensation unless such termination is based upon employment subsequent to the date of such disqualification.

>         “(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), an individual shall not be eligible for extended compensation unless, in the base period with respect to which the individual exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 weeks of full-time insured employment, or the equivalent in insured wages. For purposes of this paragraph, the equivalent in insured wages shall be earnings covered by the State law for compensation purposes which exceed 40 times the individual’s most recent weekly benefit amount or 1½ times the individual’s insured wages in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual’s insured wages were the highest (or one such quarter if his wages were the same for more than one such quarter). The State shall by law provide which one or more of the foregoing methods of measuring employment and earnings shall be used in that State.

>         “(6) No payment shall be made under this Act \[see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under [section 3311 of this title][/us/usc/t26/s3311]\] to any State in respect of any extended compensation or sharable regular compensation paid to any individual for any week if, under the rules of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), extended compensation would not have been payable to such individual for such week.

>         “(7) Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995, and no provision of State law in conformity with such paragraphs shall apply during such period.

>     “(b)

>      \[Individual’s Compensation Accounts\] (1) The State law shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application therefor, an extended compensation account with respect to such individual’s benefit year. The amount established in such account shall be not less than whichever of the following is the least:

>         “(A) 50 per centum of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) payable to him during such benefit year under such law,

>         “(B) thirteen times his average weekly benefit amount, or

>         “(C) thirty-nine times his average weekly benefit amount, reduced by the regular compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him during such benefit year under such law;

>         except that the amount so determined shall (if the State law so provides) be reduced by the aggregate amount of additional compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him under such law for prior weeks of unemployment in such benefit year which did not begin in an extended benefit period.

>         “(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), an individual’s weekly benefit amount for a week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment.

>         “(3)

>             (A)

>              Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting—

>                 “(i) ‘80 per centum’ for ‘50 per centum’ in subparagraph (A),

>         “(A) extended compensation would (but for this subsection) have been payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any State under the interstate benefit payment plan, and

>         “(B) an extended benefit period is not in effect for such week in such State.

>     “(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended compensation is payable (determined without regard to this subsection) pursuant to an interstate claim filed under the interstate benefit payment plan to the individual from the extended compensation account established for the benefit year.

>     “(3) Section 3304(a)(9)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any denial of compensation required under this subsection.

Such estimates may be made upon the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency.

>     “(e) \[Certification\] The Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable to such State under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury, prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, shall make payment to the State in accordance with such certification, by transfers from the extended unemployment compensation account to the account of such State in the Unemployment Trust Fund.
