        (2) in the case of transportation by air other than transportation described in paragraph (1), that portion of such transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part of uninterrupted international air transportation (within the meaning of subsection (c)(3)).

    (b) __Exclusion of certain travel__ 

    For purposes of this part, the term “taxable transportation” does not include that portion of any transportation by air which meets all 4 of the following requirements:

        (2)

         neither such portion nor any segment thereof is directly or indirectly—

            (A) between (i) a point where the route of the transportation leaves or enters the continental United States, or (ii) a port or station in the 225-mile zone, and

            (B) a port or station in the 225-mile zone;

        (3)

            (B) ends at either (i) the point where the route of the transportation enters the United States, or (ii) a port or station in the 225-mile zone; and

        (4) a direct line from the point (or the port or station) specified in paragraph (3)(A), to the point (or the port or station) specified in paragraph (3)(B), passes through or over a point which is not within 225 miles of the United States.

        (2) __225-mile zone__ 

            The term “225-mile zone” means that portion of Canada and Mexico which is not more than 225 miles from the nearest point in the continental United States.

        (3) __Uninterrupted international air transportation__ 

        The term “uninterrupted international air transportation” means any transportation by air which is not transportation described in subsection (a)(1) and in which—

            (A) the scheduled interval between (i) the beginning or end of the portion of such transportation which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States and (ii) the end or beginning of the other portion of such transportation is not more than 12 hours, and

            (B) the scheduled interval between the beginning or end and the end or beginning of any two segments of the portion of such transportation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) is not more than 12 hours.

            (B) effective with respect to transportation beginning after the date specified in such notice, to the extent provided in the agreement, the term “225-mile zone” shall not include part or all of the country with respect to which such determination is made.

        (2) __Termination of waiver__ 

        If a determination was made under paragraph (1) with respect to any country and the Secretary of the Treasury subsequently determines that the agreement is no longer in effect or that the agreement is no longer a qualified agreement—

            (A) the Secretary shall publish a notice of such determination in the Federal Register, and

            (B) subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall cease to apply with respect to transportation beginning after the date specified in such notice.

        (3) __Qualified agreement__

            (A) setting forth that portion of such country which is not to be treated as within the 225-mile zone, and

            (B) providing that the tax imposed by such country on transportation described in subparagraph (A) will be at a level which the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be appropriate.

        (4) __Requirement that agreement be submitted to Congress__
