            There is hereby imposed a tax at the rate specified in paragraph (2) on—

                (i) the removal of a taxable fuel from any refinery,

                (ii) the removal of a taxable fuel from any terminal,

                (iii) the entry into the United States of any taxable fuel for consumption, use, or warehousing, and

                (iv) the sale of a taxable fuel to any person who is not registered under section 4101 unless there was a prior taxable removal or entry of such fuel under clause (i), (ii), or (iii).

            (B) __Exemption for bulk transfers to registered terminals or refineries__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The tax imposed by this paragraph shall not apply to any removal or entry of a taxable fuel transferred in bulk by pipeline or vessel to a terminal or refinery if the person removing or entering the taxable fuel, the operator of such pipeline or vessel (except as provided in clause (ii)), and the operator of such terminal or refinery are registered under section 4101.

                (ii) __Nonapplication of registration to vessel operators entering by deep-draft vessel__ 

                    For purposes of clause (i), a vessel operator is not required to be registered with respect to the entry of a taxable fuel transferred in bulk by a vessel described in section 4042(c)(1).

The preceding sentence shall not apply to the removal, sale, or use of diesel-water fuel emulsion unless the person so removing, selling, or using such fuel is registered under section 4101.

        (3) __Certain refueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons treated as terminal__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), a refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon shall be treated as part of a terminal if—

                (i) such terminal is located within an airport,

                (ii) any kerosene which is loaded in such truck, tanker, or wagon at such terminal is for delivery only into aircraft at the airport in which such terminal is located,

                (iii) such truck, tanker, or wagon meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) with respect to such terminal, and

                (iv) except in the case of exigent circumstances identified by the Secretary in regulations, no vehicle registered for highway use is loaded with kerosene at such terminal.

            (B) __Requirements__ 

            A refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon meets the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to a terminal if such truck, tanker, or wagon—

                (i) has storage tanks, hose, and coupling equipment designed and used for the purposes of fueling aircraft,

                (ii) is not registered for highway use, and

                (iii)

                 is operated by—

            (C) __Reporting__ 

            The Secretary shall require under section 4101(d) reporting by such terminal operator of—

                (i) any information obtained under subparagraph (B)(iii)(II), and

            (D) __Applicable rate__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), in the case of any kerosene treated as removed from a terminal by reason of this paragraph—

                (i) the rate of tax specified in paragraph (2)(C)(i) in the case of use described in such paragraph shall apply if such terminal is located within a secured area of an airport, and

                (ii) the rate of tax specified in paragraph (2)(C)(ii) shall apply in all other cases.

        (4) __Liability for tax on kerosene used in commercial aviation__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (2)(C)(i), the person who uses the fuel for commercial aviation shall pay the tax imposed under such paragraph. For purposes of the preceding sentence, fuel shall be treated as used when such fuel is removed into the fuel tank.

    (b) __Treatment of removal or subsequent sale by blender__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There is hereby imposed a tax at the rate determined under subsection (a) on taxable fuel removed or sold by the blender thereof.

        (2) __Credit for tax previously paid__ 

        If—

            (A) tax is imposed on the removal or sale of a taxable fuel by reason of paragraph (1), and

            (B) the blender establishes the amount of the tax paid with respect to such fuel by reason of subsection (a),

            the amount of the tax so paid shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by reason of paragraph (1).

    (c) __Later separation of fuel from diesel-water fuel emulsion__ 

        If any person separates the taxable fuel from a diesel-water fuel emulsion on which tax was imposed under subsection (a) at a rate determined under subsection (a)(2)(D) (or with respect to which a credit or payment was allowed or made by reason of section 6427), such person shall be treated as the refiner of such taxable fuel. The amount of tax imposed on any removal of such fuel by such person shall be reduced by the amount of tax imposed (and not credited or refunded) on any prior removal or entry of such fuel.

    (d) __Termination__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The rates of tax specified in clauses (i) and (iii) of subsection (a)(2)(A) shall be 4.3 cents per gallon after September 30, 2016.

        Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if any person who paid the tax imposed by this section with respect to any taxable fuel establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a prior tax was paid (and not credited or refunded) with respect to such taxable fuel, then an amount equal to the tax paid by such person shall be allowed as a refund (without interest) to such person in the same manner as if it were an overpayment of tax imposed by this section.
