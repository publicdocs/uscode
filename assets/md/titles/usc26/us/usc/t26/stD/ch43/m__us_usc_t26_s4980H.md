## § 4980H. Shared responsibility for employers regarding health coverage

    (a) __Large employers not offering health coverage__

        (1) any applicable large employer fails to offer to its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan (as defined in section 5000A(f)(2)) for any month, and

        (2) at least one full-time employee of the applicable large employer has been certified to the employer under section 1411 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as having enrolled for such month in a qualified health plan with respect to which an applicable premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction is allowed or paid with respect to the employee,

        then there is hereby imposed on the employer an assessable payment equal to the product of the applicable payment amount and the number of individuals employed by the employer as full-time employees during such month.

    (b) __Large employers offering coverage with employees who qualify for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If—

            (A) an applicable large employer offers to its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan (as defined in section 5000A(f)(2)) for any month, and

            (B) 1 or more full-time employees of the applicable large employer has been certified to the employer under section 1411 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as having enrolled for such month in a qualified health plan with respect to which an applicable premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction is allowed or paid with respect to the employee,

            then there is hereby imposed on the employer an assessable payment equal to the product of the number of full-time employees of the applicable large employer described in subparagraph (B) for such month and an amount equal to 1⁄12 of $3,000.

        (2) __Overall limitation__ 

            The aggregate amount of tax determined under paragraph (1) with respect to all employees of an applicable large employer for any month shall not exceed the product of the applicable payment amount and the number of individuals employed by the employer as full-time employees during such month.

    (c) __Definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Applicable payment amount__ 

            The term “applicable payment amount” means, with respect to any month, 1⁄12 of $2,000.

            (B) __Exemption for certain employers__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                An employer shall not be considered to employ more than 50 full-time employees if—

                (ii) __Employers not in existence in preceding year__ 

                    In the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether such employer is an applicable large employer shall be based on the average number of employees that it is reasonably expected such employer will employ on business days in the current calendar year.

                (iii) __Predecessors__ 

                    Any reference in this subsection to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.

            (E) __Full-time equivalents treated as full-time employees__ 

                Solely for purposes of determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer under this paragraph, an employer shall, in addition to the number of full-time employees for any month otherwise determined, include for such month a number of full-time employees determined by dividing the aggregate number of hours of service of employees who are not full-time employees for the month by 120.

        (5) __Inflation adjustment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of any calendar year after 2014, each of the dollar amounts in subsection (b) and paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of—

                (i) such dollar amount, and
