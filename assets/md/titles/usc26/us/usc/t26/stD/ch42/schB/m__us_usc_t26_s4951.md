## § 4951. Taxes on self-dealing

    (a) __Initial taxes__ 

        (1) __On self-dealer__ 

            There is hereby imposed a tax on each act of self-dealing between a disqualified person and a trust described in section 501(c)(21). The rate of tax shall be equal to 10 percent of the amount involved with respect to the act of self-dealing for each year (or part thereof) in the taxable period. The tax imposed by this paragraph shall be paid by any disqualified person (other than a trustee acting only as a trustee of the trust) who participates in the act of self-dealing.

        (2) __On trustee__ 

            In any case in which a tax is imposed by paragraph (1), there is hereby imposed on the participation of any trustee of such a trust in an act of self-dealing between a disqualified person and the trust, knowing that it is such an act, a tax equal to 2½ percent of the amount involved with respect to the act of self-dealing for each year (or part thereof) in the taxable period, unless such participation is not willful and is due to reasonable cause. The tax imposed by this paragraph shall be paid by any such trustee who participated in the act of self-dealing.

    (b) __Additional taxes__ 

        (1) __On self-dealer__ 

            In any case in which an initial tax is imposed by subsection (a)(1) on an act of self-dealing by a disqualified person with a trust described in section 501(c)(21) and in which the act is not corrected within the taxable period, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount involved. The tax imposed by this paragraph shall be paid by any disqualified person (other than a trustee acting only as a trustee of such a trust) who participated in the act of self-dealing.

        (2) __On trustee__ 

            In any case in which an additional tax is imposed by paragraph (1), if a trustee of such a trust refused to agree to part or all of the correction, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 50 percent of the amount involved. The tax imposed by this paragraph shall be paid by any such trustee who refused to agree to part or all of the correction.

    (c) __Joint and several liability__ 

        If more than one person is liable under any paragraph of subsection (a) or (b) with respect to any one act of self-dealing, all such persons shall be jointly and severally liable under such paragraph with respect to such act.

    (d) __Self-dealing__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “self-dealing” means any direct or indirect—

            (A) sale, exchange, or leasing of real or personal property between a trust described in section 501(c)(21) and a disqualified person;

            (B) lending of money or other extension of credit between such a trust and a disqualified person;

            (C) furnishing of goods, services, or facilities between such a trust and a disqualified person;

            (D) payment of compensation (or payment or reimbursement of expenses) by such a trust to a disqualified person; and

            (E) transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a disqualified person of the income or assets of such a trust.

        (2) __Special rules__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)—

            (A) the transfer of personal property by a disqualified person to such a trust shall be treated as a sale or exchange if the property is subject to a mortgage or similar lien;

            (B) the furnishing of goods, services, or facilities by a disqualified person to such a trust shall not be an act of self-dealing if the furnishing is without charge and if the goods, services, or facilities so furnished are used exclusively for the purposes specified in section 501(c)(21)(A); and

            (C) the payment of compensation (and the payment or reimbursement of expenses) by such a trust to a disqualified person for personal services which are reasonable and necessary to carrying out the exempt purpose of the trust shall not be an act of self-dealing if the compensation (or payment or reimbursement) is not excessive.

    (e) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Taxable period__ 

        The term “taxable period” means, with respect to any act of self-dealing, the period beginning with the date on which the act of self-dealing occurs and ending on the earliest of—

            (A) the date of mailing a notice of deficiency with respect to the tax imposed by subsection (a)(1) under section 6212,

            (B) the date on which the tax imposed by subsection (a)(1) is assessed, or

            (C) the date on which correction of the act of self-dealing is completed.

        (2) __Amount involved__ 

        The term “amount involved” means, with respect to any act of self-dealing, the greater of the amount of money and the fair market value of the other property given or the amount of money and the fair market value of the other property received; except that in the case of services described in subsection (d)(2)(C), the amount involved shall be only the excess compensation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the fair market value—

            (A) in the case of the taxes imposed by subsection (a), shall be determined as of the date on which the act of self-dealing occurs; and

            (B) in the case of taxes imposed by subsection (b), shall be the highest fair market value during the taxable period.

        (3) __Correction__ 

            The terms “correction” and “correct” mean, with respect to any act of self-dealing, undoing the transaction to the extent possible, but in any case placing the trust in a financial position not worse than that in which it would be if the disqualified person were dealing under the highest fiduciary standards.

        (4) __Disqualified person__ 

        The term “disqualified person” means, with respect to a trust described in section 501(c)(21), a person who is—

            (H) a trust or estate in which persons described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E), hold more than 35 percent of the beneficial interest.

            For purposes of subparagraphs (C)(i) and (F), there shall be taken into account indirect stockholdings which would be taken into account under section 267(c), except that, for purposes of this paragraph, section 267(c)(4) shall be treated as providing that the members of the family of an individual are only those individuals described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. For purposes of subparagraphs (C) (ii) and (iii), (G), and (H), the ownership of profits or beneficial interests shall be determined in accordance with the rules for constructive ownership of stock provided in section 267(c) (other than paragraph (3) thereof), except that section 267(c)(4) shall be treated as providing that the members of the family of an individual are only those individuals described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.
