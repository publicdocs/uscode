            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __Net capital gain__ 

                    The term “net capital gain” has the meaning given such term by section 1222(11) (determined by treating the 1-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year as the company’s taxable year).

                (ii) __Net ordinary loss__ 

                    The net ordinary loss for the calendar year is the amount which would be the net operating loss of the company for the calendar year if the amount of such loss were determined in the same manner as ordinary income is determined under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Election revocable only with consent__ 

                An election under this paragraph, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

        (5) __Treatment of specified gains and losses after October 31 of calendar year__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (C) __Special rule for companies electing to use the taxable year__

        (6) __Treatment of mark to market gain__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of determining a regulated investment company’s ordinary income, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), each specified mark to market provision shall be applied as if such company’s taxable year ended on October 31. In the case of a company making an election under paragraph (4), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the last day of the company’s taxable year for October 31.

            (B) __Specified mark to market provision__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “specified mark to market provision” means sections 1256 and 1296 and any other provision of this title (or regulations thereunder) which treats property as disposed of on the last day of the taxable year.

        (7) __Elective deferral of certain ordinary losses__ 

        Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in the case of a regulated investment company which has a taxable year other than the calendar year—

            (A) such company may elect to determine its ordinary income for the calendar year without regard to any net ordinary loss (determined without regard to specified gains and losses taken into account under paragraph (5)) which is attributable to the portion of such calendar year which is after the beginning of the taxable year which begins in such calendar year, and

            (B) any amount of net ordinary loss not taken into account for a calendar year by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the following calendar year.

    (f) __Exception for certain regulated investment companies__ 

    This section shall not apply to any regulated investment company for any calendar year if at all times during such calendar year each shareholder in such company was—

        (1) a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt from tax under section 501(a),

        (2) a segregated asset account of a life insurance company held in connection with variable contracts (as defined in section 817(d))  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup> 

        (3) any other tax-exempt entity whose ownership of beneficial interests in the company would not preclude the application of section 817(h)(4), or

        (4) another regulated investment company described in this subsection.

        For purposes of the preceding sentence, any shares attributable to an investment in the regulated investment company (not exceeding $250,000) made in connection with the organization of such company shall not be taken into account.
