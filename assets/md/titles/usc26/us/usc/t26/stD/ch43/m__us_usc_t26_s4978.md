## § 4978. Tax on certain dispositions by employee stock ownership plans and certain cooperatives

    (a) __Tax on dispositions of securities to which section 1042 applies before close of minimum holding period__ 

    If, during the 3-year period after the date on which the employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owned cooperative acquired any qualified securities in a sale to which section 1042 applied or acquired any qualified employer securities in a qualified gratuitous transfer to which section 664(g) applied, such plan or cooperative disposes of any qualified securities and—

        (1) the total number of shares held by such plan or cooperative after such disposition is less than the total number of employer securities held immediately after such sale, or

        (2) except to the extent provided in regulations, the value of qualified securities held by such plan or cooperative after such disposition is less than 30 percent of the total value of all employer securities as of such disposition (60 percent of the total value of all employer securities as of such disposition in the case of any qualified employer securities acquired in a qualified gratuitous transfer to which section 664(g) applied),

        there is hereby imposed a tax on the disposition equal to the amount determined under subsection (b).

    (b) __Amount of tax__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be equal to 10 percent of the amount realized on the disposition.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

        The amount realized taken into account under paragraph (1) shall not exceed that portion allocable to qualified securities acquired in the sale to which section 1042 applied or acquired in the qualified gratuitous transfer to which section 664(g) applied determined as if such securities were disposed of—

            (A) first from qualified securities to which section 1042 applied or to which section 664(g) applied acquired during the 3-year period ending on the date of the disposition, beginning with the securities first so acquired, and

            (B) then from any other employer securities.

            If subsection (d) applies to a disposition, the disposition shall be treated as made from employer securities in the opposite order of the preceding sentence.

        (3) __Distributions to employees__ 

            The amount realized on any distribution to an employee for less than fair market value shall be determined as if the qualified security had been sold to the employee at fair market value.

    (c) __Liability for payment of taxes__ 

    The tax imposed by this subsection shall be paid by—

        (1) the employer, or

        (2) the eligible worker-owned cooperative,

        that made the written statement described in section 664(g)(1)(E) or in section 1042(b)(3) (as the case may be).

    (d) __Section not to apply to certain dispositions__

            (C) the disability of the employee (within the meaning of section 72(m)(7)), or

            (D) the separation of the employee from service for any period which results in a 1-year break in service (within the meaning of section 411(a)(6)(A)).

        (2) __Certain reorganizations__ 

            In the case of any exchange of qualified securities in any reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) for stock of another corporation, such exchange shall not be treated as a disposition for purposes of this section.

        (3) __Liquidation of corporation into cooperative__ 

            In the case of any exchange of qualified securities pursuant to the liquidation of the corporation issuing qualified securities into the eligible worker-owned cooperative in a transaction which meets the requirements of section 332 (determined by substituting “100 percent” for “80 percent” each place it appears in section 332(b)(1)), such exchange shall not be treated as a disposition for purposes of this section.

        (4) __Dispositions to meet diversification requirements__ 

            This section shall not apply to any disposition of qualified securities which is required under section 401(a)(28).

    (e) __Definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—
