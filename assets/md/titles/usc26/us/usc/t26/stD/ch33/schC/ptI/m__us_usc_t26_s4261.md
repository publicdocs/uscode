        (3) __Changes in segments by reason of rerouting__ 

        If—

            (A) transportation is purchased between 2 locations on specified flights, and

            (B) there is a change in the route taken between such 2 locations which changes the number of domestic segments, but there is no change in the amount charged for such transportation,

            the tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall be determined without regard to such change in route.

    (c) __Use of international travel facilities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There is hereby imposed a tax of $12.00 on any amount paid (whether within or without the United States) for any transportation of any person by air, if such transportation begins or ends in the United States.

        (2) __Exception for transportation entirely taxable under subsection (a)__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to any transportation all of which is taxable under subsection (a) (determined without regard to sections 4281 and 4282).

        (3) __Special rule for Alaska and Hawaii__ 

            In any case in which the tax imposed by paragraph (1) applies to a domestic segment beginning or ending in Alaska or Hawaii, such tax shall apply only to departures and shall be at the rate of $6.

    (d) __By whom paid__ 

        Except as provided in section 4263(a), the taxes imposed by this section shall be paid by the person making the payment subject to the tax.

    (e) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __Segments to and from rural airports__ 

            (A) __Exception from segment tax__ 

                The tax imposed by subsection (b)(1) shall not apply to any domestic segment beginning or ending at an airport which is a rural airport for the calendar year in which such segment begins or ends (as the case may be).

            (B) __Rural airport__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “rural airport” means, with respect to any calendar year, any airport if—

                (i) there were fewer than 100,000 commercial passengers departing by air (in the case of any airport described in clause (ii)(III), on flight segments of at least 100 miles) during the second preceding calendar year from such airport, and

                (ii)

                 such airport—

                    (I) is not located within 75 miles of another airport which is not described in clause (i),

                    (II) is receiving essential air service subsidies as of the date of the enactment of this paragraph, or

                    (III) is not connected by paved roads to another airport.

        (2) __Amounts paid outside the United States__ 

            In the case of amounts paid outside the United States for taxable transportation, the taxes imposed by subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if such transportation begins and ends in the United States.

        (3) __Amounts paid for right to award free or reduced rate air transportation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any amount paid (and the value of any other benefit provided) to an air carrier (or any related person) for the right to provide mileage awards for (or other reductions in the cost of) any transportation of persons by air shall be treated for purposes of subsection (a) as an amount paid for taxable transportation, and such amount shall be taxable under subsection (a) without regard to any other provision of this subchapter.

            (B) __Controlled group__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a corporation and all wholly owned subsidiaries of such corporation shall be treated as 1 corporation.

            (C) __Regulations__ 

                The Secretary shall prescribe rules which reallocate items of income, deduction, credit, exclusion, or other allowance to the extent necessary to prevent the avoidance of tax imposed by reason of this paragraph. The Secretary may prescribe rules which exclude from the tax imposed by subsection (a) amounts attributable to mileage awards which are used other than for transportation of persons by air.

        (4) __Inflation adjustment of dollar rates of tax__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of taxable events in a calendar year after the last nonindexed year, the $3.00 amount contained in subsection (b) and each dollar amount contained in subsection (c) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

                (i) such dollar amount, multiplied by

                (ii) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting the year before the last nonindexed year for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

                If any increase determined under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 10 cents, such increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 cents.

            (B) __Last nonindexed year__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the last nonindexed year is—

            (D) __Special rule for amounts paid for domestic segments beginning after 2002__ 

                If an amount is paid during a calendar year for a domestic segment beginning in a later calendar year, then the rate of tax under subsection (b) on such amount shall be the rate in effect for the calendar year in which such amount is paid.

    (f) __Exemption for certain uses__

        (1) by helicopter for the purpose of transporting individuals, equipment, or supplies in the exploration for, or the development or removal of, hard minerals, oil, or gas, or

        (2) by helicopter or by fixed-wing aircraft for the purpose of the planting, cultivation, cutting, or transportation of, or caring for, trees (including logging operations),
