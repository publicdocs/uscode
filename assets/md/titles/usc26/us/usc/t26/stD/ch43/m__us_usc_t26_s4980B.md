## § 4980B. Failure to satisfy continuation coverage requirements of group health plans

    (a) __General rule__ 

        There is hereby imposed a tax on the failure of a group health plan to meet the requirements of subsection (f) with respect to any qualified beneficiary.

    (b) __Amount of tax__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a) on any failure with respect to a qualified beneficiary shall be $100 for each day in the noncompliance period with respect to such failure.

        (2) __Noncompliance period__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “noncompliance period” means, with respect to any failure, the period—

            (A) beginning on the date such failure first occurs, and

            (B)

             ending on the earlier of—

                (i) the date such failure is corrected, or

                (ii) the date which is 6 months after the last day in the period applicable to the qualified beneficiary under subsection (f)(2)(B) (determined without regard to clause (iii) thereof).

            If a person is liable for tax under subsection (e)(1)(B) by reason of subsection (e)(2)(B) with respect to any failure, the noncompliance period for such person with respect to such failure shall not begin before the 45th day after the written request described in subsection (e)(2)(B) is provided to such person.

                (i) which are not corrected before the date a notice of examination of income tax liability is sent to the employer, and

                (ii) which occurred or continued during the period under examination,

                the amount of tax imposed by subsection (a) by reason of such failures with respect to such beneficiary shall not be less than the lesser of $2,500 or the amount of tax which would be imposed by subsection (a) without regard to such paragraphs.

            (B) __Higher minimum tax where violations are more than de minimis__ 

                To the extent violations by the employer (or the plan in the case of a multiemployer plan) for any year are more than de minimis, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “$15,000” for “$2,500” with respect to the employer (or such plan).

    (c) __Limitations on amount of tax__ 

        (1) __Tax not to apply where failure not discovered exercising reasonable diligence__ 

            No tax shall be imposed by subsection (a) on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that none of the persons referred to in subsection (e) knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed.

        (2) __Tax not to apply to failures corrected within 30 days__ 

        No tax shall be imposed by subsection (a) on any failure if—

            (A) such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, and

        (4) __Overall limitation for unintentional failures__

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of failures with respect to plans other than multiemployer plans, the tax imposed by subsection (a) for failures during the taxable year of the employer shall not exceed the amount equal to the lesser of—

                    (I) 10 percent of the aggregate amount paid or incurred by the employer (or predecessor employer) during the preceding taxable year for group health plans, or

                    (II) $500,000.

                (ii) __Taxable years in the case of certain controlled groups__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, if not all persons who are treated as a single employer for purposes of this section have the same taxable year, the taxable years taken into account shall be determined under principles similar to the principles of section 1561.

            (B) __Multiemployer plans__ 

                (i) __In general__

                 For purposes of the preceding sentence, all plans of which the same trust forms a part shall be treated as 1 plan.

                (ii) __Special rule for employers required to pay tax__
