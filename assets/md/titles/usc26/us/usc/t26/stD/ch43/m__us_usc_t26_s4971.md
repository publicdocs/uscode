## § 4971. Taxes on failure to meet minimum funding standards

    (a) __Initial tax__ 

    If at any time during any taxable year an employer maintains a plan to which section 412 applies, there is hereby imposed for the taxable year a tax equal to—

        (1) in the case of a single-employer plan, 10 percent of the aggregate unpaid minimum required contributions for all plan years remaining unpaid as of the end of any plan year ending with or within the taxable year, and

        (2) in the case of a multiemployer plan, 5 percent of the accumulated funding deficiency determined under section 431 as of the end of any plan year ending with or within the taxable year.

    (b) __Additional tax__ 

    If—

        (1) a tax is imposed under subsection (a)(1) on any unpaid minimum required contribution and such amount remains unpaid as of the close of the taxable period, or

        (2) a tax is imposed under subsection (a)(2) on any accumulated funding deficiency and the accumulated funding deficiency is not corrected within the taxable period,

        there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the unpaid minimum required contribution or accumulated funding deficiency, whichever is applicable, to the extent not so paid or corrected.

    (c) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Accumulated funding deficiency__ 

            The term “accumulated funding deficiency” has the meaning given to such term by section 431.

        (2) __Correct__ 

            The term “correct” means, with respect to an accumulated funding deficiency, the contribution, to or under the plan, of the amount necessary to reduce such accumulated funding deficiency as of the end of a plan year in which such deficiency arose to zero.

        (3) __Taxable period__ 

        The term “taxable period” means, with respect to an accumulated funding deficiency or unpaid minimum required contribution, whichever is applicable, the period beginning with the end of the plan year in which there is an accumulated funding deficiency or unpaid minimum required contribution, whichever is applicable  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

            (B) __Ordering rule__ 

                Any payment to or under a plan for any plan year shall be allocated first to unpaid minimum required contributions for all preceding plan years on a first-in, first-out basis and then to the minimum required contribution under section 430 for the plan year.

    (d) __Notification of the Secretary of Labor__ 

    Before issuing a notice of deficiency with respect to the tax imposed by subsection (a) or (b), the Secretary shall notify the Secretary of Labor and provide him a reasonable opportunity (but not more than 60 days)—

        (1) to require the employer responsible for contributing to or under the plan to eliminate the accumulated funding deficiency or unpaid minimum required contribution, whichever is applicable, or

        (2) to comment on the imposition of such tax.

    (f) __Failure to pay liquidity shortfall__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of a plan to which section 430(j)(4) applies, there is hereby imposed a tax of 10 percent of the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the amount of the liquidity shortfall for any quarter, over

            (B) the amount of such shortfall which is paid by the required installment under section 430(j) for such quarter (but only if such installment is paid on or before the due date for such installment).

        (2) __Additional tax__ 

            If the plan has a liquidity shortfall as of the close of any quarter and as of the close of each of the following 4 quarters, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount on which tax was imposed by paragraph (1) for such first quarter.

        (3) __Definitions and special rule__

            (B) any tax imposed under this subsection for a taxable year with respect to a multiemployer plan if, for the plan years ending with or within the taxable year, the plan is in endangered status pursuant to section 432 shall be in addition to any other tax imposed by this section.

        (2) __Failure to comply with funding improvement or rehabilitation plan__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If any funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan in effect under section 432 with respect to a multiemployer plan requires an employer to make a contribution to the plan, there is hereby imposed a tax on each failure of the employer to make the required contribution within the time required under such plan.

            (B) __Amount of tax__

        If—

            (A) a plan which is in seriously endangered status fails to meet the applicable benchmarks by the end of the funding improvement period, or

            (B)

             a plan which is in critical status either—

                (i) fails to meet the requirements of section 432(e) by the end of the rehabilitation period, or

                (ii) has received a certification under section 432(b)(3)(A)(ii) for 3 consecutive plan years that the plan is not making the scheduled progress in meeting its requirements under the rehabilitation plan,

                the plan shall be treated as having an accumulated funding deficiency for purposes of this section for the last plan year in such funding improvement, rehabilitation, or 3-consecutive year period (and each succeeding plan year until such benchmarks or requirements are met) in an amount equal to the greater of the amount of the contributions necessary to meet such benchmarks or requirements or the amount of such accumulated funding deficiency without regard to this paragraph.

        (4) __Failure to adopt rehabilitation plan__

For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable cause includes unanticipated and material market fluctuations, the loss of a significant contributing employer, or other factors to the extent that the payment of tax under this subsection with respect to the failure would be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
