    (b) __Taxable foundations__ 

    There is hereby imposed on each private foundation which is not exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for the taxable year, with respect to the carrying on of its activities, a tax equal to—

        (1) the amount (if any) by which the sum of (A) the tax imposed under subsection (a) (computed as if such subsection applied to such private foundation for the taxable year), plus (B) the amount of the tax which would have been imposed under section 511 for the taxable year if such private foundation had been exempt from taxation under section 501(a), exceeds

Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this section, net investment income shall be determined under the principles of subtitle A.

        (2) __Gross investment income__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “gross investment income” means the gross amount of income from interest, dividends, rents, payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in section 512(a)(5)), and royalties, but not including any such income to the extent included in computing the tax imposed by section 511.

            (A) There shall not be taken into account any gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property to the extent that such gain or loss is taken into account for purposes of computing the tax imposed by section 511.

            (B) The basis for determining gain in the case of property held by the private foundation on December 31, 1969, and continuously thereafter to the date of its disposition shall be deemed to be not less than the fair market value of such property on December 31, 1969.

            (C) Losses from sales or other dispositions of property shall be allowed only to the extent of gains from such sales or other dispositions, and there shall be no capital loss carryovers or carrybacks.

>         “(E) not apply to an organization which is prohibited by its governing instrument or other instrument from distributing capital or corpus to the extent the requirements of section 4942 are inconsistent with such prohibition; and

>             “(ii) by applying section 4942(f) without regard to dividend income for such stock, and

>             “(iii) by defining the distributable amount as the sum of the amount determined under section 4942(d) (after the application of clauses (i) and (ii)), and the amount of the dividend income from such stock.

>         With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, subparagraphs (B) and (E) shall apply only during the pendency of any judicial proceeding by the private foundation which is necessary to reform, or to excuse such foundation from compliance with, its governing instrument or any other instrument (as in effect on May 26, 1969) in order to comply with the provisions of section 4942, and in the case of subparagraph (B) for all periods after the termination of such judicial proceeding during which the governing instrument or any other instrument does not permit compliance with such provisions.

>     “(4) __Section 4943.—__ 

>         “(A)

>          In the case of a private foundation—

>             “(i) which was incorporated before January 1, 1951;

>             “(iii) which acquired such stock solely by gift, devise, or bequest, section 4943(c)(4)(A)(i) shall be applied with respect to the holdings of such foundation in such incorporated business enterprise as if it did not contain the phrase ‘, but in no event shall the percentage so substituted be more than 50 percent’, and section 4943(c)(4)(D) shall not apply with respect to such holdings. For purposes of the preceding sentence, stock of such enterprise in a trust created before May 27, 1969, of which the foundation is the remainder beneficiary shall be deemed to be held by such foundation on May 26, 1969, if such foundation held (without regard to such trust) more than 20 percent of the stock of such enterprise on May 26, 1969.

>         “(B)

>          Subparagraph (A) shall apply to a private foundation only if—

>             “(i) the foundation does not purchase any stock or other interest in the enterprise described in subparagraph (A) after May 26, 1969, and does not acquire any stock or other interest in any other business enterprise which constitutes excess business holdings under section 4943; and

>             “(ii) in the last 5 taxable years ending on or before December 31, 1970, the foundation expends substantially all of its adjusted net income (as defined in section 4942(f)) for the purpose or function for which it is organized and operated.

>         “(C) For purposes of section 4943(c)(6), the term ‘purchase’ does not include an exchange which is described in paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection and which is pursuant to a plan for disposition of excess business holdings.

>     “(5) __Section 4945.—__ 

>     Section 4945(d)(4) and (h) shall not apply to a grant which is described in paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection.

>     “(6) __Section 508(e).—__ 

>     Section 508(e) shall not apply to require inclusion in governing instruments of any provisions inconsistent with this subsection.

>     “(7) __Section 509(a).—__ 

>     In the case of any trust created under the terms of a will or a codicil to a will executed on or before March 30, 1924, by which the testator bequeathed all of the outstanding common stock of a corporation in trust, the income of which trust is to be used principally for the benefit of those from time to time employed by the corporation and their families, the trustees of which trust are elected or selected from among the employees of such corporation, and which trust does not own directly any stock in any other corporation, if the trust makes an irrevocable election under this paragraph within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Dec. 30, 1969\], such trust shall be treated as not being a private foundation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 but shall be treated for purposes of such Code as if it were not exempt from tax under section 501(a) for any taxable year beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Dec. 30, 1969\] and before the date (if any) on which such trust has complied with the requirements of section 507 for termination of the status of an organization as a private foundation.

>     “(8) __Certain redemptions.—__ 

>     For purposes of applying section 302(b)(1) to the determination of the amount of gross investment income under sections 4940 and 4948(a), any distribution made to a private foundation in redemption of stock held by such private foundation in a business enterprise shall be treated as not essentially equivalent to a dividend, if such redemption is described in paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection.”
