## § 5223. Redistillation of spirits, articles, and residues

    (a) __Spirits on bonded premises__ 

        The proprietor of a distilled spirits plant authorized to produce distilled spirits may, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, redistill any distilled spirits which have not been withdrawn from bonded premises.

    (b) __Distilled spirits returned for redistillation__ 

        Distilled spirits which have been lawfully removed from bonded premises free of tax or without payment of tax may, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, be returned for redistillation to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant authorized to produce distilled spirits.

    (c) __Redistillation of articles and residues__ 

        Articles, containing denatured distilled spirits, which were manufactured under the provisions of subchapter D or on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, and the spirits residues of manufacturing processes related thereto, may be received, and the distilled spirits therein recovered by redistillation, on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant authorized to produce distilled spirits, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.

    (d) __Denatured distilled spirits, articles, and residues__ 

        Distilled spirits recovered by the redistillation of denatured distilled spirits, or by the redistillation of the articles or residues described in subsection (c), may not be withdrawn from bonded premises except for industrial use or after denaturation thereof in the manner prescribed by law.

    (e) __Products of redistillation__ 

        All distilled spirits redistilled on bonded premises subsequent to production gauge shall be treated the same as if such spirits had been originally produced by the redistiller and all provisions of this chapter applicable to the original production of distilled spirits shall be applicable thereto. Any prior obligation as to taxes, liens, and bonds with respect to such distilled spirits shall be extinguished on redistillation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting any provision of law relating to the labeling of distilled spirits or as limiting the authority of the Secretary to regulate the marking, branding, or identification of distilled spirits redistilled under this section.
