    (a) __Collection by return__ 

        The taxes on distilled spirits, wines, and beer shall be collected on the basis of a return. The Secretary shall, by regulation, prescribe the period or event for which such return shall be filed, the time for filing such return, the information to be shown in such return, and the time for payment of such tax.

    (b) __Exceptions__ 

    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), any taxes imposed on, or amounts to be paid or collected in respect of, distilled spirits, wines, and beer under—

        shall be immediately due and payable at the time provided by such provisions (or if no specific time for payment is provided, at the time the event referred to in such provision occurs). Such taxes and amounts shall be assessed and collected by the Secretary on the basis of the information available to him in the same manner as taxes payable by return but with respect to which no return has been filed.

    (c) __Import duties__ 

        The internal revenue taxes imposed by this part shall be in addition to any import duties unless such duties are specifically designated as being in lieu of internal revenue tax.

    (d) __Time for collecting tax on distilled spirits, wines, and beer__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in the case of distilled spirits, wines, and beer to which this part applies (other than subsection (b) of this section) which are withdrawn under bond for deferred payment of tax, the last day for payment of such tax shall be the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the withdrawal occurs.

        (2) __Imported articles__

            (B) __Special rule for entry for warehousing__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (D), in the case of an entry for warehousing, the last day for payment of tax shall not be later than the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the article is removed from the 1st such warehouse.

            (C) __Foreign trade zones__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (D) and in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, articles brought into a foreign trade zone shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be treated for purposes of this subsection as if such zone were a single customs warehouse.

            (D) __Exception for articles destined for export__ 

                Subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not apply to any article which is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary to be destined for export.

        (4) __Taxpayers liable for taxes of not more than $50,000__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of any taxpayer who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes imposed with respect to distilled spirits, wines, and beer under subparts A, C, and D and section 7652 for the calendar year and who was liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, the last day for the payment of tax on withdrawals, removals, and entries (and articles brought into the United States from Puerto Rico) under bond for deferred payment shall be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter during which the action giving rise to the imposition of such tax occurs.

            (B) __No application after limit exceeded__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due under subparts A, C, and D and section 7652 from such taxpayer during such calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax under such subparts which has not been paid on such date shall be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which such date occurs.

            (C) __Calendar quarter__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “calendar quarter” means the three-month period ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.

        (5) __Special rule for tax due in September__

            (B) __Safe harbor__ 

                The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as met if the amount paid not later than September 29 is not less than 11⁄15 of the taxes on distilled spirits, wines, and beer for the period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15.

            (C) __Taxpayers not required to use electronic funds transfer__

        (6) __Special rule where due date falls on Saturday, Sunday, or holiday__ 

            Notwithstanding section 7503, if, but for this paragraph, the due date under this subsection for payment of tax would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday (within the meaning of section 7503), such due date shall be the immediately preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a holiday (or the immediately following day where the due date described in paragraph (5) falls on a Sunday).

    (e) __Payment by electronic fund transfer__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any person who in any 12-month period ending December 31, was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding $5,000,000 in taxes imposed on distilled spirits, wines, or beer by sections 5001, 5041, and 5051 (or 7652), respectively, shall pay such taxes during the succeeding calendar year by electronic fund transfer to a Federal Reserve Bank.

        (2) __Electronic fund transfer__ 

            The term “electronic fund transfer” means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit an account.

        (3) __Controlled groups__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a controlled group of corporations, all corporations which are component members of such group shall be treated as 1 taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “controlled group of corporations” has the meaning given to such term by subsection (a) of section 1563, except that “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in such subsection.

            (B) __Controlled groups which include nonincorporated persons__ 

                Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to the principles of subparagraph (A) shall apply to a group of persons under common control where 1 or more of such persons is not a corporation.
