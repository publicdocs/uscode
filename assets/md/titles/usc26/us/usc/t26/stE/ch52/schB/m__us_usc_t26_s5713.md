            (C) has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application for such permit,

            (D) has failed to maintain his premises in such manner as to protect the revenue,

            (E) is, by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with this chapter, or

            (F) has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes,

            the Secretary shall issue an order, stating the facts charged, citing such person to show cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked.

        (2) __Action following hearing__ 

            If, after hearing, the Secretary finds that such person has not shown cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked, such permit shall be suspended for such period as the Secretary deems proper or shall be revoked.
