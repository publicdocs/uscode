    (2) such concentrate is rendered unfit for use as a beverage before removal from the place of manufacture, or (in the case of a concentrate which does not exceed 24 percent alcohol by volume) such concentrate is transferred to a bonded wine cellar for use in production of natural wine as provided in section 5382; and

    (3) the manufacturer thereof makes such application, keeps such records, renders such reports, files such bonds, and complies with such other requirements with respect to the production, removal, sale, transportation, and use of such concentrate and of the mash or juice from which such concentrate is produced, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe as necessary for the protection of the revenue.
