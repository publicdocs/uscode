## § 9706. Assignment of eligible beneficiaries

    (a) __In general__ 

    For purposes of this chapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall, before October 1, 1993, assign each coal industry retiree who is an eligible beneficiary to a signatory operator which (or any related person with respect to which) remains in business in the following order:

        (1)

         First, to the signatory operator which—

            (A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and

            (B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for at least 2 years.

        (2)

         Second, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1), to the signatory operator which—

            (A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and

            (B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry.

        (3) Third, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1) or (2), to the signatory operator which employed the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for a longer period of time than any other signatory operator prior to the effective date of the 1978 coal wage agreement.

    (b) __Rules relating to employment and reassignment upon purchase__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a)—

        (1) __Aggregation rules__ 

            (A) __Related person__ 

                Any employment of a coal industry retiree in the coal industry by a signatory operator shall be treated as employment by any related persons to such operator.

            (B) __Certain employment disregarded__ 

            Employment with—

                (i) a person which is (and all related persons with respect to which are) no longer in business, or

                (ii) a person during a period during which such person was not a signatory to a coal wage agreement,

                shall not be taken into account.

        (2) __Reassignment upon purchase__ 

            If a person becomes a successor of an assigned operator after the enactment date, the assigned operator may transfer the assignment of an eligible beneficiary under subsection (a) to such successor, and such successor shall be treated as the assigned operator with respect to such eligible beneficiary for purposes of this chapter. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assigned operator transferring such assignment (and any related person) shall remain the guarantor of the benefits provided to the eligible beneficiary under this chapter. An assigned operator shall notify the trustees of the Combined Fund of any transfer described in this paragraph.

    (c) __Identification of eligible beneficiaries__ 

        The 1950 UMWA Benefit Plan and the 1974 UMWA Benefit Plan shall, by the later of October 1, 1992, or the twentieth day after the enactment date, provide to the Commissioner of Social Security a list of the names and social security account numbers of each eligible beneficiary, including each deceased eligible beneficiary if any other individual is an eligible beneficiary by reason of a relationship to such deceased eligible beneficiary. In addition, the plans shall provide, where ascertainable from plan records, the names of all persons described in subsection (a) with respect to any eligible beneficiary or deceased eligible beneficiary.

    (d) __Cooperation by other agencies and persons__ 

        (1) __Cooperation__ 

            The head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall cooperate fully and promptly with the Commissioner of Social Security in providing information which will enable the Commissioner to carry out his responsibilities under this section.

        (2) __Providing of information__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 6103, the head of any other agency, department, or instrumentality shall, upon receiving a written request from the Commissioner of Social Security in connection with this section, cause a search to be made of the files and records maintained by such agency, department, or instrumentality with a view to determining whether the information requested is contained in such files or records. The Commissioner shall be advised whether the search disclosed the information requested, and, if so, such information shall be promptly transmitted to the Commissioner, except that if the disclosure of any requested information would contravene national policy or security interests of the United States, or the confidentiality of census data, the information shall not be transmitted and the Commissioner shall be so advised.

            (B) __Limitation__ 

                Any information provided under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to information necessary for the Commissioner to carry out his duties under this section.

            The trustees of the Combined Fund, the 1950 UMWA Benefit Plan, the 1974 UMWA Benefit Plan, the 1950 UMWA Pension Plan, and the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan shall fully and promptly cooperate with the Commissioner in furnishing, or assisting the Commissioner to obtain, any information the Commissioner needs to carry out the Commissioner’s responsibilities under this section.

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any assigned operator receiving a notice under subsection (e)(2) with respect to an eligible beneficiary may, within 30 days of receipt of such notice, request from the Commissioner of Social Security detailed information as to the work history of the beneficiary and the basis of the assignment.

        (2) __Review__ 

            An assigned operator may, within 30 days of receipt of the information under paragraph (1), request review of the assignment. The Commissioner of Social Security shall conduct such review if the Commissioner finds the operator provided evidence with the request constituting a prima facie case of error.

        (3) __Results of review__ 

            (A) __Error__ 

            If the Commissioner of Social Security determines under a review under paragraph (2) that an assignment was in error—

                (i) the Commissioner shall notify the assigned operator and the trustees of the Combined Fund and the trustees shall reduce the premiums of the operator under section 9704 by (or if there are no such premiums, repay) all premiums paid under section 9704 with respect to the eligible beneficiary, and

                (ii) the Commissioner shall review the beneficiary’s record for reassignment under subsection (a).

            (B) __No error__

    (g) __Confidentiality of information__ 

        Any person to which information is provided by the Commissioner of Social Security under this section shall not disclose such information except in any proceedings related to this section.

            (A) revoke all assignments to persons other than 1988 agreement operators for purposes of assessing premiums for plan years beginning on and after October 1, 2007; and

            (B) make no further assignments to persons other than 1988 agreement operators, except that no individual who becomes an unassigned beneficiary by reason of subparagraph (A) may be assigned to a 1988 agreement operator.

        (2) __Reassignment upon purchase__ 

            This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the reassignment under subsection (b)(2) of an eligible beneficiary.
