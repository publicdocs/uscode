    For purposes of this section, the term “Indian general welfare benefit” includes any payment made or services provided to or on behalf of a member of an Indian tribe (or any spouse or dependent of such a member) pursuant to an Indian tribal government program, but only if—

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Indian tribal government__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “Indian tribal government” includes any agencies or instrumentalities of an Indian tribal government and any Alaska Native regional or village corporation, as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ([43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601], <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  et seq.).

        (3) __Lavish or extravagant__ 

            The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Tribal Advisory Committee (as established under section 3(a) of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2013), <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  establish guidelines for what constitutes lavish or extravagant benefits with respect to Indian tribal government programs.

        (4) __Establishment of tribal government program__ 

            A program shall not fail to be treated as an Indian tribal government program solely by reason of the program being established by tribal custom or government practice.
