            (B) __Disallowed amount carried to succeeding taxable year__ 

                Any amount disallowed under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall be treated as disqualified interest paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year (and clause (ii) of paragraph (2)(A) shall not apply for purposes of applying this subsection to the amount so treated).

                (ii) __Excess limitation carryforward__ 

                    If a corporation has an excess limitation for any taxable year, the amount of such excess limitation shall be an excess limitation carryforward to the 1st succeeding taxable year and to the 2nd and 3rd succeeding taxable years to the extent not previously taken into account under this clause.

The preceding sentence shall not apply to any interest allocable to any partner in such partnership who is a related person to the taxpayer.

                (ii) __Special rule where treaty reduction__ 

                    If any treaty between the United States and any foreign country reduces the rate of tax imposed by this subtitle on a partner’s share of any interest paid or accrued to a partnership, such partner’s interests in such partnership shall, for purposes of clause (i), be treated as held in part by a tax-exempt person and in part by a taxable person under rules similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(B).

        (5) __Special rules for determining whether interest is subject to tax__ 

            (A) __Treatment of pass-thru entities__ 

                In the case of any interest paid or accrued to a partnership, the determination of whether any tax is imposed by this subtitle on such interest shall be made at the partner level.

            (B) __Interest treated as tax-exempt to extent of treaty reduction__ 

            If any treaty between the United States and any foreign country reduces the rate of tax imposed by this subtitle on any interest paid or accrued by the taxpayer, such interest shall be treated as interest on which no tax is imposed by this subtitle to the extent of the same proportion of such interest as—

                (i) the rate of tax imposed without regard to such treaty, reduced by the rate of tax imposed under the treaty, bears to
