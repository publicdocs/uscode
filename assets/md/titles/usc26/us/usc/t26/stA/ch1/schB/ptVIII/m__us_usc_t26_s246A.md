            (B)

             as of the beginning of the ex-dividend date—

    (d) __Average indebtedness percentage__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term “average indebtedness percentage” means the percentage obtained by dividing—

            (A) the average amount (determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the portfolio indebtedness with respect to the stock during the base period, by

            (B) the average amount (determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the adjusted basis of the stock during the base period.

        (2) __Special rule where stock not held throughout base period__ 

            In the case of any stock which was not held by the taxpayer throughout the base period, paragraph (1) shall be applied as if the base period consisted only of that portion of the base period during which the stock was held by the taxpayer.

        Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any reduction under this section in the amount allowable as a deduction under section 243 or 245 with respect to any dividend shall not exceed the amount of any interest deduction (including any deductible short sale expense) allocable to such dividend.

    (f) __Regulations__ 

        The regulations prescribed for purposes of this section under section 7701(f) shall include regulations providing for the disallowance of interest deductions or other appropriate treatment (in lieu of reducing the dividend received deduction) where the obligor of the indebtedness is a person other than the person receiving the dividend.
