        (2) __Adjustment for repayments during year__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this section, the amount of social security benefits received during any taxable year shall be reduced by any repayment made by the taxpayer during the taxable year of a social security benefit previously received by the taxpayer (whether or not such benefit was received during the taxable year).

            (B) __Denial of deduction__ 

                If (but for this subparagraph) any portion of the repayments referred to in subparagraph (A) would have been allowable as a deduction for the taxable year under section 165, such portion shall be allowable as a deduction only to the extent it exceeds the social security benefits received by the taxpayer during the taxable year (and not repaid during such taxable year).

            (A) any portion of a lump-sum payment of social security benefits received during the taxable year is attributable to prior taxable years, and

            (B) the taxpayer makes an election under this subsection for the taxable year,

        then the amount included in gross income under this section for the taxable year by reason of the receipt of such portion shall not exceed the sum of the increases in gross income under this chapter for prior taxable years which would result solely from taking into account such portion in the taxable years to which it is attributable.

        (2) __Special rules__ 

            (A) __Year to which benefit attributable__ 

                For purposes of this subsection, a social security benefit is attributable to a taxable year if the generally applicable payment date for such benefit occurred during such taxable year.

            (B) __Election__
