## § 383. Special limitations on certain excess credits, etc.

    (a) __Excess credits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Under regulations, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation, the amount of any excess credit for any taxable year which may be used in any post-change year shall be limited to an amount determined on the basis of the tax liability which is attributable to so much of the taxable income as does not exceed the section 382 limitation for such post-change year to the extent available after the application of section 382 and subsections (b) and (c) of this section.

        (2) __Excess credit__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “excess credit” means—

            (A) any unused general business credit of the corporation under section 39, and

            (B) any unused minimum tax credit of the corporation under section 53.

    (b) __Limitation on net capital loss__ 

        If an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation, the amount of any net capital loss under section 1212 for any taxable year before the 1st post-change year which may be used in any post-change year shall be limited under regulations which shall be based on the principles applicable under section 382. Such regulations shall provide that any such net capital loss used in a post-change year shall reduce the section 382 limitation which is applied to pre-change losses under section 382 for such year.

    (c) __Foreign tax credits__ 

        If an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation, the amount of any excess foreign taxes under section 904(c) for any taxable year before the 1st post-change taxable year shall be limited under regulations which shall be consistent with purposes of this section and section 382.

    (d) __Pro ration rules for year which includes change__ 

        For purposes of this section, rules similar to the rules of subsections (b)(3) and (d)(1)(B) of section 382 shall apply.

    (e) __Definitions__ 

        Terms used in this section shall have the same respective meanings as when used in section 382, except that appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account that the limitations of this section apply to credits and net capital losses.
