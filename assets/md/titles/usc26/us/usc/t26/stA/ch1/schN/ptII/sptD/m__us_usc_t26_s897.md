        For purposes of this title, gain or loss of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation from the disposition of a United States real property interest shall be taken into account—

            (A) in the case of a nonresident alien individual, under section 871(B)(1), or

            (B) in the case of a foreign corporation, under section 882(a)(1),

            as if the taxpayer were engaged in a trade or business within the United States during the taxable year and as if such gain or loss were effectively connected with such trade or business.

        (2) __Minimum tax on nonresident alien individuals__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of any nonresident alien individual, the taxable excess for purposes of section 55(b)(1)(A) shall not be less than the lesser of—

                (ii) the individual’s net United States real property gain for the taxable year.

            (B) __Net United States real property gain__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “net United States real property gain” means the excess of—

                (ii) the aggregate of the losses for the taxable year from dispositions of such interests.

    (b) __Limitation on losses of individuals__ 

        In the case of an individual, a loss shall be taken into account under subsection (a) only to the extent such loss would be taken into account under section 165(c) (determined without regard to subsection (a) of this section).

    (c) __United States real property interest__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __United States real property interest__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “United States real property interest” means—

                (i) an interest in real property (including an interest in a mine, well, or other natural deposit) located in the United States or the Virgin Islands, and

                (ii)

                 any interest (other than an interest solely as a creditor) in any domestic corporation unless the taxpayer establishes (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary by regulations prescribes) that such corporation was at no time a United States real property holding corporation during the shorter of—

                    (I) the period after June 18, 1980, during which the taxpayer held such interest, or

                    (II) the 5-year period ending on the date of the disposition of such interest.

            (B) __Exclusion for interest in certain corporations__ 

            The term “United States real property interest” does not include any interest in a corporation if—

                (ii)

                 all of the United States real property interests held by such corporation at any time during the shorter of the periods described in subparagraph (A)(ii)—

                    (I) were disposed of in transactions in which the full amount of the gain (if any) was recognized, or

                    (II) ceased to be United States real property interests by reason of the application of this subparagraph to 1 or more other corporations.

        (2) __United States real property holding corporation__ 

        The term “United States real property holding corporation” means any corporation if—

            (A) the fair market value of its United States real property interests equals or exceeds 50 percent of

            (B)

                (i) its United States real property interests,

                (ii) its interests in real property located outside the United States, plus

                (iii) any other of its assets which are used or held for use in a trade or business.

        (3) __Exception for stock regularly traded on established securities markets__ 

            If any class of stock of a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market, stock of such class shall be treated as a United States real property interest only in the case of a person who, at some time during the shorter of the periods described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), held more than 5 percent of such class of stock.

        (4) __Interests held by foreign corporations and by partnerships, trusts, and estates__ 

        For purposes of determining whether any corporation is a United States real property holding corporation—

            (B) __Interests held by partnerships, etc.__ 

                Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assets held by a partnership, trust, or estate shall be treated as held proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries. Any asset treated as held by a partner or beneficiary by reason of this subparagraph which is used or held for use by the partnership, trust, or estate in a trade or business shall be treated as so used or held by the partner or beneficiary. Any asset treated as held by a partner or beneficiary by reason of this subparagraph shall be so treated for purposes of applying this subparagraph successively to partnerships, trusts, or estates which are above the first partnership, trust, or estate in a chain thereof.

        (5) __Treatment of controlling interests__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Under regulations, for purposes of determining whether any corporation is a United States real property holding corporation, if any corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “first corporation”) holds a controlling interest in a second corporation—

                (i) the stock which the first corporation holds in the second corporation shall not be taken into account,

                (ii) the first corporation shall be treated as holding a portion of each asset of the second corporation equal to the percentage of the fair market value of the stock of the second corporation represented by the stock held by the first corporation, and

                (iii) any asset treated as held by the first corporation by reason of clause (ii) which is used or held for use by the second corporation in a trade or business shall be treated as so used or held by the first corporation.

                Any asset treated as held by the first corporation by reason of the preceding sentence shall be so treated for purposes of applying the preceding sentence successively to corporations which are above the first corporation in a chain of corporations.

            (B) __Controlling interest__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “controlling interest” means 50 percent or more of the fair market value of all classes of stock of a corporation.

                The term “real property” includes movable walls, furnishings, and other personal property associated with the use of the real property.

            (C) __Constructive ownership rules__ 

                For purposes of determining under paragraph (3) whether any person holds more than 5 percent of any class of stock and of determining under paragraph (5) whether a person holds a controlling interest in any corporation, section 318(a) shall apply (except that paragraphs (2)(C) and (3)(C) of section 318(a) shall be applied by substituting “5 percent” for “50 percent”).

    (d) __Treatment of distributions by foreign corporations__

            Except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, gain shall be recognized by a foreign corporation on the distribution (including a distribution in liquidation or redemption) of a United States real property interest in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such interest (as of the time of the distribution) over its adjusted basis.

        (2) __Exceptions__

    (e) __Coordination with nonrecognition provisions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except to the extent otherwise provided in subsection (d) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, any nonrecognition provision shall apply for purposes of this section to a transaction only in the case of an exchange of a United States real property interest for an interest the sale of which would be subject to taxation under this chapter.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any distribution by a qualified investment entity to a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation with respect to any class of stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States shall not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest if such individual or corporation did not own more than 5 percent of such class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of such distribution.

                (ii) __Termination__ 

                    Clause (i)(II) shall not apply after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an entity described in clause (i)(II) shall be treated as a qualified investment entity for purposes of applying paragraphs (1) and (5) and section 1445 with respect to any distribution by the entity to a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation which is attributable directly or indirectly to a distribution to the entity from a real estate investment trust.

            (B) __Domestically controlled__

            (C) __Foreign ownership percentage__ 

                The term “foreign ownership percentage” means that percentage of the stock of the qualified investment entity which was held (directly or indirectly) by foreign persons at the time during the testing period during which the direct and indirect ownership of stock by foreign persons was greatest.

            (A) __In general__ 

                If an interest in a domestically controlled qualified investment entity is disposed of in an applicable wash sale transaction, the taxpayer shall, for purposes of this section, be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest in an amount equal to the portion of the distribution described in subparagraph (B) with respect to such interest which, but for the disposition, would have been treated by the taxpayer as gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest under paragraph (1).

            (B) __Applicable wash sales transaction__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __In general__ 

                The term “applicable wash sales transaction” means any transaction (or series of transactions) under which a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, or qualified investment entity—

                    (I) disposes of an interest in a domestically controlled qualified investment entity during the 30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution which is to be made with respect to the interest and any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated by the taxpayer as gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest under paragraph (1), and

                    (II) acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, a substantially identical interest in such entity during the 61-day period beginning with the 1st day of the 30-day period described in subclause (I).

                 For purposes of subclause (II), a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, or qualified investment entity shall be treated as having acquired any interest acquired by a person related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the individual, corporation, or entity, and any interest which such person has entered into any contract or option to acquire.

                (ii) __Application to substitute dividend and similar payments__

                    (I) any substitute dividend payment (within the meaning of section 861), or

                    (II) any other similar payment specified in regulations which the Secretary determines necessary to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph.

                 The portion of any such payment treated by the taxpayer as gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest under subparagraph (A) by reason of this clause shall be equal to the portion of the distribution such payment is in lieu of which would have been so treated but for the transaction giving rise to such payment.

                (iii) __Exception where distribution actually received__ 

                    A transaction shall not be treated as an applicable wash sales transaction if the nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, or qualified investment entity receives the distribution described in clause (i)(I) with respect to either the interest which was disposed of, or acquired, in the transaction.

                (iv) __Exception for certain publicly traded stock__ 

                    A transaction shall not be treated as an applicable wash sales transaction if it involves the disposition of any class of stock in a qualified investment entity which is regularly traded on an established securities market within the United States but only if the nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, or qualified investment entity did not own more than 5 percent of such class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution described in clause (i)(I).

    (i) __Election by foreign corporation to be treated as domestic corporation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If—

            (A) a foreign corporation holds a United States real property interest, and

            (B) under any treaty obligation of the United States the foreign corporation is entitled to nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to that interest,

            then such foreign corporation may make an election to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of this section, section 1445, and section 6039C.

        (2) __Revocation only with consent__ 

            Any election under paragraph (1), once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

        (3) __Making of election__ 

        An election under paragraph (1) may be made only—

            (A) if all of the owners of all classes of interests (other than interests solely as a creditor) in the foreign corporation at the time of the election consent to the making of the election and agree that gain, if any, from the disposition of such interest after June 18, 1980, which would be taken into account under subsection (a) shall be taxable notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a treaty to which the United States is a party, and

            (B) subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations with respect to the corporation or its shareholders.

            In the case of a class of interest (other than an interest solely as a creditor) which is regularly traded on an established securities market, the consent described in subparagraph (A) need only be made by any person if such person held more than 5 percent of such class of interest at some time during the shorter of the periods described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii). The constructive ownership rules of subsection (c)(6)(C) shall apply in determining whether a person held more than 5 percent of a class of interest.

        (4) __Exclusive method of claiming nondiscrimination__ 

            The election provided by paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive remedy for any person claiming discriminatory treatment with respect to this section, section 1145, and section 6039C.

        (1) the fair market value of such property transferred, over

        (2)

         the sum of—

            (A) the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the transferor, plus

            (B) the amount of gain, if any, recognized to the transferor under any other provision at the time of the transfer.
