        (3) __Special rules__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Not in existence for entire 3-year period__ 

                If the entity was not in existence for the entire 3-year period referred to in paragraph (1), such paragraph shall be applied on the basis of the period during which such entity (or trade or business) was in existence.

                The term “farming business” includes the raising, harvesting, or growing of trees to which section 263A(c)(5) applies.

        (2) __Qualified personal service corporation__ 

        The term “qualified personal service corporation” means any corporation—

            (A) substantially all of the activities of which involve the performance of services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting, and
