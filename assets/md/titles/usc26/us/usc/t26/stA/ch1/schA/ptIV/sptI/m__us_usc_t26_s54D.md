## § 54D. Qualified energy conservation bonds

    (a) __Qualified energy conservation bond__ 

    For purposes of this subchapter, the term “qualified energy conservation bond” means any bond issued as part of an issue if—

        (1) 100 percent of the available project proceeds of such issue are to be used for one or more qualified conservation purposes,

        (2) the bond is issued by a State or local government, and

        (3) the issuer designates such bond for purposes of this section.

    (b) __Reduced credit amount__ 

        The annual credit determined under section 54A(b) with respect to any qualified energy conservation bond shall be 70 percent of the amount so determined without regard to this subsection.

        The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds which may be designated under subsection (a) by any issuer shall not exceed the limitation amount allocated to such issuer under subsection (e).

    (d) __National limitation on amount of bonds designated__ 

        There is a national qualified energy conservation bond limitation of $3,200,000,000.

    (e) __Allocations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The limitation applicable under subsection (d) shall be allocated by the Secretary among the States in proportion to the population of the States.

        (2) __Allocations to largest local governments__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of any State in which there is a large local government, each such local government shall be allocated a portion of such State’s allocation which bears the same ratio to the State’s allocation (determined without regard to this subparagraph) as the population of such large local government bears to the population of such State.

            (B) __Allocation of unused limitation to State__ 

                The amount allocated under this subsection to a large local government may be reallocated by such local government to the State in which such local government is located.

            (C) __Large local government__ 

                For purposes of this section, the term “large local government” means any municipality or county if such municipality or county has a population of 100,000 or more.

        (3) __Allocation to issuers; restriction on private activity bonds__ 

            Any allocation under this subsection to a State or large local government shall be allocated by such State or large local government to issuers within the State in a manner that results in not less than 70 percent of the allocation to such State or large local government being used to designate bonds which are not private activity bonds.

        (4) __Special rules for bonds to implement green community programs__ 

            In the case of any bond issued for the purpose of providing loans, grants, or other repayment mechanisms for capital expenditures to implement green community programs, such bond shall not be treated as a private activity bond for purposes of paragraph (3).

                (iii) rural development involving the production of electricity from renewable energy resources, or

                (iv) any qualified facility (as determined under section 45(d) without regard to paragraphs (8) and (10) thereof and without regard to any placed in service date).

            (B)

             Expenditures with respect to research facilities, and research grants, to support research in—

                (i) development of cellulosic ethanol or other nonfossil fuels,

                (iii) increasing the efficiency of existing technologies for producing nonfossil fuels,

                (iv) automobile battery technologies and other technologies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in transportation, or

                (v) technologies to reduce energy use in buildings.

            (C) Mass commuting facilities and related facilities that reduce the consumption of energy, including expenditures to reduce pollution from vehicles used for mass commuting.

            (D)
