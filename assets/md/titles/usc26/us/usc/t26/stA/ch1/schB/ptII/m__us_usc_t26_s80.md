## § 80. Restoration of value of certain securities

    (a) __General rule__ 

    In the case of a domestic corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 11 or 801, if the value of any security (as defined in section 165(g)(2))—

        (1) which became worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing of property to which such security was related, and

        (2) which was taken into account as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or with respect to which a deduction for a loss was allowed under section 165,

        is restored in whole or in part during any taxable year by reason of any recovery of money or other property in respect of the property to which such security was related, the value so restored (to the extent that, when added to the value so restored during prior taxable years, it does not exceed the amount of the loss described in paragraph (2)) shall, except as provided in subsection (b), be included in gross income for the taxable year in which such restoration occurs.

    (b) __Reduction for failure to receive tax benefit__ 

        The amount otherwise includible in gross income under subsection (a) in respect of any security shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount (if any) of the loss described in subsection (a)(2) which did not result in a reduction of the taxpayer’s tax under this subtitle for any taxable year, determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (c) __Character of income__ 

    For purposes of this subtitle—

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount included in gross income under this section shall be treated as ordinary income.

        (2) If the loss described in subsection (a)(2) was taken into account as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, the amount included in gross income under this section shall be treated as long-term capital gain.

    (d) __Treatment under foreign expropriation loss recovery provisions__ 

        This section shall not apply to any recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which section 1351 applies.
