        (5) __Later payments treated as receipt of tax paid amounts__ 

            If paragraph (1) applies for any taxable year, payments received in subsequent taxable years by the person making the first disposition shall not be treated as the receipt of payments with respect to the first disposition to the extent that the aggregate of such payments does not exceed the amount treated as received by reason of paragraph (1).

            (A) paragraph (1) applies with respect to any installment obligation received by a shareholder from a corporation, and

            (B) by reason of the liquidation such shareholder receives property in more than 1 taxable year,
