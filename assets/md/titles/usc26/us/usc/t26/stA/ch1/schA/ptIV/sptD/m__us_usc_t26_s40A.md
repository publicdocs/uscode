        (1) the biodiesel mixture credit, plus

        (2) the biodiesel credit, plus

        (3) in the case of an eligible small agri-biodiesel producer, the small agri-biodiesel producer credit.

    (b) __Definition of biodiesel mixture credit, biodiesel credit, and small agri-biodiesel producer credit__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Biodiesel mixture credit__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The biodiesel mixture credit of any taxpayer for any taxable year is $1.00 for each gallon of biodiesel used by the taxpayer in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture.

            (B) __Qualified biodiesel mixture__ 

            The term “qualified biodiesel mixture” means a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel (as defined in section 4083(a)(3)), determined without regard to any use of kerosene, which—

                (i) is sold by the taxpayer producing such mixture to any person for use as a fuel, or

                (ii) is used as a fuel by the taxpayer producing such mixture.

            (C) __Sale or use must be in trade or business, etc.__ 

            Biodiesel used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture shall be taken into account—

                (i) only if the sale or use described in subparagraph (B) is in a trade or business of the taxpayer, and

                (ii) for the taxable year in which such sale or use occurs.

            (D) __Casual off-farm production not eligible__ 

                No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any casual off-farm production of a qualified biodiesel mixture.

        (2) __Biodiesel credit__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The biodiesel credit of any taxpayer for any taxable year is $1.00 for each gallon of biodiesel which is not in a mixture with diesel fuel and which during the taxable year—

                (ii) is sold by the taxpayer at retail to a person and placed in the fuel tank of such person’s vehicle.

            (B) __User credit not to apply to biodiesel sold at retail__ 

                No credit shall be allowed under subparagraph (A)(i) with respect to any biodiesel which was sold in a retail sale described in subparagraph (A)(ii).

        (3) __Certification for biodiesel__ 

            No credit shall be allowed under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) unless the taxpayer obtains a certification (in such form and manner as prescribed by the Secretary) from the producer or importer of the biodiesel which identifies the product produced and the percentage of biodiesel and agri-biodiesel in the product.

        (4) __Small agri-biodiesel producer credit__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The small agri-biodiesel producer credit of any eligible small agri-biodiesel producer for any taxable year is 10 cents for each gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production of such producer.

            (B) __Qualified agri-biodiesel production__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “qualified agri-biodiesel production” means any agri-biodiesel which is produced by an eligible small agri-biodiesel producer, and which during the taxable year—

                (i)

        (1) __Biodiesel__ 

        The term “biodiesel” means the monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from plant or animal matter which meet—

                    (I) such reduction, over

                    (II) the amount not apportioned to such patrons under subparagraph (A) for the taxable year,

                 shall be treated as an increase in tax imposed by this chapter on the organization. Such increase shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining the amount of any credit under this chapter or for purposes of section 55.

                Except as provided in the last 3 sentences of paragraph (3), the term “renewable diesel” shall include fuel derived from biomass which meets the requirements of a Department of Defense specification for military jet fuel or an American Society of Testing and Materials specification for aviation turbine fuel.

            (B) __Application of mixture credits__ 

                In the case of fuel which is treated as renewable diesel solely by reason of subparagraph (A), subsection (b)(1) and section 6426(c) shall be applied with respect to such fuel by treating kerosene as though it were diesel fuel.
