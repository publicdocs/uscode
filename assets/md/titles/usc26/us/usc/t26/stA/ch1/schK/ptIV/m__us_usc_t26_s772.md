        (2) taxable income or loss from other activities,

        (3)

         net capital gain (or net capital loss)—

            (A) to the extent allocable to passive loss limitation activities, and

            (B) to the extent allocable to other activities,

    (b) __Separate computations__ 

        In determining the amounts required under subsection (a) to be separately taken into account by any partner, this section and section 773 shall be applied separately with respect to such partner by taking into account such partner’s distributive share of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the partnership.

    (c) __Treatment at partner level__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in this subsection, rules similar to the rules of section 702(b) shall apply to any partner’s distributive share of the amounts referred to in subsection (a).

        (2) __Income or loss from passive loss limitation activities__ 

            For purposes of this chapter, any partner’s distributive share of any income or loss described in subsection (a)(1) shall be treated as an item of income or loss (as the case may be) from the conduct of a trade or business which is a single passive activity (as defined in section 469). A similar rule shall apply to a partner’s distributive share of amounts referred to in paragraphs (3)(A) and (5)(A) of subsection (a).

        (3) __Income or loss from other activities__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this chapter, any partner’s distributive share of any income or loss described in subsection (a)(2) shall be treated as an item of income or expense (as the case may be) with respect to property held for investment.

            (B) __Deductions for loss not subject to section 67__ 

                The deduction under section 212 for any loss described in subparagraph (A) shall not be treated as a miscellaneous itemized deduction for purposes of section 67.

        (4) __Treatment of net capital gain or loss__ 

            For purposes of this chapter, any partner’s distributive share of any gain or loss described in subsection (a)(3) shall be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be.

        (5) __Minimum tax treatment__ 

            In determining the alternative minimum taxable income of any partner, such partner’s distributive share of any applicable net AMT adjustment shall be taken into account in lieu of making the separate adjustments provided in sections 56, 57, and 58 with respect to the items of the partnership. Except as provided in regulations, the applicable net AMT adjustment shall be treated, for purposes of section 53, as an adjustment or item of tax preference not specified in section 53(d)(1)(B)(ii).

        (6) __General credits__ 

            A partner’s distributive share of the amount referred to in paragraph (6) of subsection (a) shall be taken into account as a current year business credit.

        The term “passive loss limitation activity” means—

            (A) any activity which involves the conduct of a trade or business, and

        (2) __Tax-exempt interest__ 

            The term “tax-exempt interest” means interest excludable from gross income under section 103.

        (3) __Applicable net AMT adjustment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The applicable net AMT adjustment is—

                (ii) with respect to corporations, the net adjustment determined by using the adjustments applicable to corporations.

            (B) __Net adjustment__ 

                The term “net adjustment” means the net adjustment in the items attributable to passive loss activities or other activities (as the case may be) which would result if such items were determined with the adjustments of sections 56, 57, and 58.

        (4) __Treatment of certain separately stated items__ 

            (A) __Exclusion for certain purposes__ 

                In determining the amounts referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), any net capital gain or net capital loss (as the case may be), and any item referred to in subsection (a)(11), shall be excluded.

            (B) __Allocation rules__ 

            The net capital gain shall be treated—

                (i) as allocable to passive loss limitation activities to the extent the net capital gain does not exceed the net capital gain determined by only taking into account gains and losses from sales and exchanges of property used in connection with such activities, and

                (ii) as allocable to other activities to the extent such gain exceeds the amount allocated under clause (i).

                A similar rule shall apply for purposes of allocating any net capital loss.

    (f) __Special rules for applying passive loss limitations__ 

    If any person holds an interest in an electing large partnership other than as a limited partner—

        (1) paragraph (2) of subsection (c) shall not apply to such partner, and
