## § 817. Treatment of variable contracts

    (a) __Increases and decreases in reserves__ 

    For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of section 807, the sum of the items described in section 807(c) taken into account as of the close of the taxable year with respect to any variable contract shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be adjusted—

        (1) by subtracting therefrom an amount equal to the sum of the amounts added from time to time (for the taxable year) to the reserves separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c) by reason of appreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of), and

        (2) by adding thereto an amount equal to the sum of the amounts subtracted from time to time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of depreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of).

        The deduction allowable for items described in paragraphs (1) and (6) of section 805(a) with respect to variable contracts shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of such items is increased for the taxable year by appreciation (or increased to the extent that the amount of such items is decreased for the taxable year by depreciation) not reflected in adjustments under the preceding sentence.

    (b) __Adjustment to basis of assets held in segregated asset account__ 

    In the case of variable contracts, the basis of each asset in a segregated asset account shall (in addition to all other adjustments to basis) be—

        (1) increased by the amount of any appreciation in value, and

        (2) decreased by the amount of any depreciation in value,

        to the extent such appreciation and depreciation are from time to time reflected in the increases and decreases in reserves or other items referred to in subsection (a) with respect to such contracts.

    (c) __Separate accounting__ 

    For purposes of this part, a life insurance company which issues variable contracts shall separately account for the various income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, and other liability items properly attributable to such variable contracts. For such items as are not accounted for directly, separate accounting shall be made—

        (1) in accordance with the method regularly employed by such company, if such method is reasonable, and

        (2) in all other cases, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (d) __Variable contract defined__ 

    For purposes of this part, the term “variable contract” means a contract—

        (1) which provides for the allocation of all or part of the amounts received under the contract to an account which, pursuant to State law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the company,

        (2)

         which—

            (A) provides for the payment of annuities,

            (B) is a life insurance contract, or

            (C) provides for funding of insurance on retired lives as described in section 807(c)(6), and

        (3)

         under which—

            (A) in the case of an annuity contract, the amounts paid in, or the amount paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account,

            (B) in the case of a life insurance contract, the amount of the death benefit (or the period of coverage) is adjusted on the basis of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account, or

            (C) in the case of funds held under a contract described in paragraph (2)(C), the amounts paid in, or the amounts paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account.

        If a contract ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value, such contract shall not be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) after such cessation. Paragraph (3) shall be applied without regard to whether there is a guarantee, and obligations under such guarantee which exceed obligations under the contract without regard to such guarantee shall be accounted for as part of the company’s general account.

    (e) __Pension plan contracts treated as paying annuity__ 

        A pension plan contract which is not a life, accident, or health, property, casualty, or liability insurance contract shall be treated as a contract which provides for the payments of annuities for purposes of subsection (d).

    (f) __Other special rules__ 

        (1) __Life insurance reserves__ 

            For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A) of section 816, the reflection of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account shall be considered an assumed rate of interest.

        (2) __Additional separate computations__ 

            Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such additional separate computations shall be made, with respect to the items separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c), as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and this part.

    (g) __Variable annuity contracts treated as annuity contracts__ 

    For purposes of this part, the term “annuity contract” includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed on the basis of—

        (1) recognized mortality tables, and

        (2)

            (A) the investment experience of a segregated asset account, or

            (B) the company-wide investment experience of the company.

        Paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any company which issues contracts which are not variable contracts.

    (h) __Treatment of certain nondiversified contracts__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of subchapter L, section 72 (relating to annuities), and section 7702(a) (relating to definition of life insurance contract), a variable contract (other than a pension plan contract) which is otherwise described in this section and which is based on a segregated asset account shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments made by such account are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, adequately diversified.

        (2) __Safe harbor for diversification__ 

        A segregated asset account shall be treated as meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) for any quarter of a taxable year if as of the close of such quarter—

            (A) it meets the requirements of section 851(b)(3), and

            (B) no more than 55 percent of the value of the total assets of the account are assets described in section 851(b)(3)(A)(i).

        (3) __Special rule for investments in United States obligations__ 

            To the extent that any segregated asset account with respect to a variable life insurance contract is invested in securities issued by the United States Treasury, the investments made by such account shall be treated as adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1).

        (4) __Look-through in certain cases__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, if all of the beneficial interests in a regulated investment company or in a trust are held by 1 or more—

            (A) insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their general account or in segregated asset accounts, or

            (B) fund managers (or affiliated companies) in connection with the creation or management of the regulated investment company or trust,

            the diversification requirements of paragraph (1) shall be applied by taking into account the assets held by such regulated investment company or trust.

        (5) __Independent investment advisors permitted__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the use of independent investment advisors.

        (6) __Government securities funds__ 

            In determining whether a segregated asset account is adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1), each United States Government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer.
