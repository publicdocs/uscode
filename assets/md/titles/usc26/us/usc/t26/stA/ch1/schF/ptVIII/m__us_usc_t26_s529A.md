## § 529A. Qualified ABLE programs

    (a) __General rule__ 

        A qualified ABLE program shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such program shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable organizations).

    (b) __Qualified ABLE program__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified ABLE program” means a program established and maintained by a State, or agency or instrumentality thereof—

            (A) under which a person may make contributions for a taxable year, for the benefit of an individual who is an eligible individual for such taxable year, to an ABLE account which is established for the purpose of meeting the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account,

            (B) which limits a designated beneficiary to 1 ABLE account for purposes of this section, and

            (C) which meets the other requirements of this section.

        (2) __Cash contributions__ 

        A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that no contribution will be accepted—

            (A) unless it is in cash, or

            (B) except in the case of contributions under subsection (c)(1)(C), if such contribution to an ABLE account would result in aggregate contributions from all contributors to the ABLE account for the taxable year exceeding the amount in effect under section 2503(b) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.

            For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of section 408(d)(4) (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof) shall apply.

        (3) __Separate accounting__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides separate accounting for each designated beneficiary.

        (4) __Limited investment direction__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that any designated beneficiary under such program may, directly or indirectly, direct the investment of any contributions to the program (or any earnings thereon) no more than 2 times in any calendar year.

        (5) __No pledging of interest as security__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program if it allows any interest in the program or any portion thereof to be used as security for a loan.

        (6) __Prohibition on excess contributions__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides adequate safeguards to prevent aggregate contributions on behalf of a designated beneficiary in excess of the limit established by the State under section 529(b)(6). For purposes of the preceding sentence, aggregate contributions include contributions under any prior qualified ABLE program of any State or agency or instrumentality thereof.

    (c) __Tax treatment__ 

        (1) __Distributions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any distribution under a qualified ABLE program shall be includible in the gross income of the distributee in the manner as provided under section 72 to the extent not excluded from gross income under any other provision of this chapter.

            (B) __Distributions for qualified disability expenses__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, if distributions from a qualified ABLE program—

                (i) do not exceed the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary, no amount shall be includible in gross income, and

                (ii) in any other case, the amount otherwise includible in gross income shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as such expenses bear to such distributions.

            (C) __Change in designated beneficiaries or programs__ 

                (i) __Rollovers from able accounts__ 

                    Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any amount paid or distributed from an ABLE account to the extent that the amount received is paid, not later than the 60th day after the date of such payment or distribution, into another ABLE account for the benefit of the same designated beneficiary or an eligible individual who is a member of the family of the designated beneficiary.

                (ii) __Change in designated beneficiaries__ 

                    Any change in the designated beneficiary of an interest in a qualified ABLE program during a taxable year shall not be treated as a distribution for purposes of subparagraph (A) if the new beneficiary is an eligible individual for such taxable year and a member of the family of the former beneficiary.

                (iii) __Limitation on certain rollovers__ 

                    Clause (i) shall not apply to any transfer if such transfer occurs within 12 months from the date of a previous transfer to any qualified ABLE program for the benefit of the designated beneficiary.

            (D) __Operating rules__ 

            For purposes of applying section 72—

                (i) except to the extent provided by the Secretary, all distributions during a taxable year shall be treated as one distribution, and

                (ii) except to the extent provided by the Secretary, the value of the contract, income on the contract, and investment in the contract shall be computed as of the close of the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.

        (2) __Gift tax rules__ 

        For purposes of chapters 12 and 13—

            (A) __Contributions__ 

            Any contribution to a qualified ABLE program on behalf of any designated beneficiary—

                (i) shall be treated as a completed gift to such designated beneficiary which is not a future interest in property, and

                (ii) shall not be treated as a qualified transfer under section 2503(e).

            (B) __Treatment of distributions__ 

                In no event shall a distribution from an ABLE account to such account’s designated beneficiary be treated as a taxable gift.

            (C) __Treatment of transfer to new designated beneficiary__ 

                The taxes imposed by chapters 12 and 13 shall not apply to a transfer by reason of a change in the designated beneficiary under subsection (c)(1)(C).

        (3) __Additional tax for distributions not used for disability expenses__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The tax imposed by this chapter for any taxable year on any taxpayer who receives a distribution from a qualified ABLE program which is includible in gross income shall be increased by 10 percent of the amount which is so includible.

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the payment or distribution is made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the designated beneficiary) on or after the death of the designated beneficiary.

            (C) __Contributions returned before certain date__ 

            Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the distribution of any contribution made during a taxable year on behalf of the designated beneficiary if—

                (i) such distribution is received on or before the day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for filing such designated beneficiary’s return for such taxable year, and

                (ii) such distribution is accompanied by the amount of net income attributable to such excess contribution.

                Any net income described in clause (ii) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year in which such excess contribution was made.

        (4) __Loss of ABLE account treatment__ 

            If an ABLE account is established for a designated beneficiary, no account subsequently established for such beneficiary shall be treated as an ABLE account. The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of an account established for purposes of a rollover described in paragraph (1)(C)(i) of this section if the transferor account is closed as of the end of the 60th day referred to in paragraph (1)(C)(i).

    (d) __Reports__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each officer or employee having control of the qualified ABLE program or their designee shall make such reports regarding such program to the Secretary and to designated beneficiaries with respect to contributions, distributions, the return of excess contributions, and such other matters as the Secretary may require.

        (2) __Certain aggregated information__ 

            For research purposes, the Secretary shall make available to the public reports containing aggregate information, by diagnosis and other relevant characteristics, on contributions and distributions from the qualified ABLE program. In carrying out the preceding sentence an item may not be made available to the public if such item can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular individual.
