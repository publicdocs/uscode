Such designation shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe.

    (c) __Treatment of contributions__ 

        (1) __No deduction allowed__ 

            No deduction shall be allowed under section 219 for a contribution to a Roth IRA.

        (2) __Contribution limit__ 

        The aggregate amount of contributions for any taxable year to all Roth IRAs maintained for the benefit of an individual shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 with respect to such individual for such taxable year (computed without regard to subsection (d)(1) or (g) of such section), over

            (B) the aggregate amount of contributions for such taxable year to all other individual retirement plans (other than Roth IRAs) maintained for the benefit of the individual.

        (3) __Limits based on modified adjusted gross income__ 

            (A) __Dollar limit__ 

            The amount determined under paragraph (2) for any taxable year shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2)(A) for such taxable year, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as—

                (i)

                 the excess of—

                    (I) the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over

                    (II) the applicable dollar amount, bears to

                (ii) $15,000 ($10,000 in the case of a joint return or a married individual filing a separate return).

                The rules of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 219(g)(2) shall apply to any reduction under this subparagraph.

            (B) __Definitions__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (ii)

                 the applicable dollar amount is—

                    (I) in the case of a taxpayer filing a joint return, $150,000,

                    (II) in the case of any other taxpayer (other than a married individual filing a separate return), $95,000, and

                Section 219(g)(4) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.

            (D) __Inflation adjustment__ 

            In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2006, the dollar amounts in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (B)(ii) shall each be increased by an amount equal to—

                (i) such dollar amount, multiplied by

                (ii) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2005” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

                Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.

        (4) __Contributions permitted after age 70½__

                        The amount otherwise required to be included in gross income for any taxable year beginning in 2010 or the first taxable year in the 2-year period under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be increased by the aggregate distributions from Roth IRAs for such taxable year which are allocable under paragraph (4) to the portion of such qualified rollover contribution required to be included in gross income under subparagraph (A)(i).

                    (II) __Limitation on aggregate amount included__ 

                        The amount required to be included in gross income for any taxable year under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall not exceed the aggregate amount required to be included in gross income under subparagraph (A)(iii) for all taxable years in the 2-year period (without regard to subclause (I)) reduced by amounts included for all preceding taxable years.

                (ii) __Death of distributee__ 

                    (I) __In general__

                    (II) __Special rule for surviving spouse__ 

                        If the spouse of the individual described in subclause (I) acquires the individual’s entire interest in any Roth IRA to which such qualified rollover contribution is properly allocable, the spouse may elect to treat the remaining amounts described in subclause (I) as includible in the spouse’s gross income in the taxable years of the spouse ending with or within the taxable years of such individual in which such amounts would otherwise have been includible. Any such election may not be made or changed after the due date for the spouse’s taxable year which includes the date of death.

            (F) __Special rule for applying section 72__ 

                (i) __In general__

                    (II) such distribution is made within the 5-taxable year period beginning with the taxable year in which such contribution was made,

                 then section 72(t) shall be applied as if such portion were includible in gross income.

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    Clause (i) shall apply only to the extent of the amount of the qualified rollover contribution includible in gross income under subparagraph (A)(i).

            (B) __Special rules__ 

                (i) __Transfer of earnings__ 

                    Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the transfer of any contribution unless such transfer is accompanied by any net income allocable to such contribution.

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified rollover contribution” means a rollover contribution—

            (A) to a Roth IRA from another such account,
