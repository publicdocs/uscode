        (1) this section shall not apply, and

        (2) such income shall be sourced under the rules of sections 861(a)(6), 862(a)(6), and 863.

        Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any income from the sale of any unprocessed timber which is a softwood and was cut from an area in the United States shall be sourced in the United States and the rules of sections 862(a)(6) and 863(b) shall not apply to any such income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “unprocessed timber” means any log, cant, or similar form of timber.

    (c) __Exception for depreciable personal property__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Gain (not in excess of the depreciation adjustments) from the sale of depreciable personal property shall be allocated between sources in the United States and sources outside the United States—

            (A) by treating the same proportion of such gain as sourced in the United States as the United States depreciation adjustments with respect to such property bear to the total depreciation adjustments, and

            (B) by treating the remaining portion of such gain as sourced outside the United States.

        (2) __Gain in excess of depreciation__ 

            Gain (in excess of the depreciation adjustments) from the sale of depreciable personal property shall be sourced as if such property were inventory property.

        (3) __United States depreciation adjustments__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “United States depreciation adjustments” means the portion of the depreciation adjustments to the adjusted basis of the property which are attributable to the depreciation deductions allowable in computing taxable income from sources in the United States.

            (B) __Special rule for certain property__ 

            Except in the case of property of a kind described in section 168(g)(4), if, for any taxable year—

                (i) such property is used predominantly in the United States, or

                (ii) such property is used predominantly outside the United States,

                all of the depreciation deductions allowable for such year shall be treated as having been allocated to income from sources in the United States (or, where clause (ii) applies, from sources outside the United States).

        (4) __Other definitions__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Depreciable personal property__

            (C) __Depreciation deductions__ 

                The term “depreciation deductions” means any deductions for depreciation or amortization or any other deduction allowable under any provision of this chapter which treats an otherwise capital expenditure as a deductible expense.

    (d) __Exception for intangibles__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of any sale of an intangible—

            (A) this section shall apply only to the extent the payments in consideration of such sale are not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible, and

            (B) to the extent such payments are so contingent, the source of such payments shall be determined under this part in the same manner as if such payments were royalties.

        (2) __Intangible__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “intangible” means any patent, copyright, secret process or formula, goodwill, trademark, trade brand, franchise, or other like property.

        (3) __Special rule in the case of goodwill__ 

            To the extent this section applies to the sale of goodwill, payments in consideration of such sale shall be treated as from sources in the country in which such goodwill was generated.

        (4) __Coordination with subsection (c)__ 

            (A) __Gain not in excess of depreciation adjustments sourced under subsection (c)__ 

                Notwithstanding paragraph (1), any gain from the sale of an intangible shall be sourced under subsection (c) to the extent such gain does not exceed the depreciation adjustments with respect to such intangible.

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, if a nonresident maintains an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, income from any sale of personal property (including inventory property) attributable to such office or other fixed place of business shall be sourced in the United States. The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of section 971 (defining export trade corporation).

            (B) __Exception__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any sale of inventory property which is sold for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if an office or other fixed place of business of the taxpayer in a foreign country materially participated in the sale.

        (3) __Sales attributable to an office or other fixed place of business__
