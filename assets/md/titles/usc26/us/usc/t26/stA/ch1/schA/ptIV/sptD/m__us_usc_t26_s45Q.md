## § 45Q. Credit for carbon dioxide sequestration

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of section 38, the carbon dioxide sequestration credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of—

        (1)

         $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which is—

            (A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified facility, and

            (B) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage and not used by the taxpayer as described in paragraph (2)(B), and

        (2)

         $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which is—

            (A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified facility,

            (B) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, and

            (C) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage.

    (b) __Qualified carbon dioxide__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified carbon dioxide” means carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source which—

            (A) would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas, and

            (B) is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal or injection.

        (2) __Recycled carbon dioxide__ 

            The term “qualified carbon dioxide” includes the initial deposit of captured carbon dioxide used as a tertiary injectant. Such term does not include carbon dioxide that is re-captured, recycled, and re-injected as part of the enhanced oil and natural gas recovery process.

    (c) __Qualified facility__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “qualified facility” means any industrial facility—

        (1) which is owned by the taxpayer,

        (2) at which carbon capture equipment is placed in service, and

        (3) which captures not less than 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide during the taxable year.

    (d) __Special rules and other definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Only carbon dioxide captured and disposed of or used within the United States taken into account__ 

        The credit under this section shall apply only with respect to qualified carbon dioxide the capture and disposal or use of which is within—

            (A) the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), or

            (B) a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).

        (2) __Secure geological storage__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. A comma probably should appear. </sup></sup>  the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior,, <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. </sup></sup>  shall establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of carbon dioxide under paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(C) of subsection (a) such that the carbon dioxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Such term shall include storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

        (3) __Tertiary injectant__ 

            The term “tertiary injectant” has the same meaning as when used within section 193(b)(1).

        (4) __Qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project__ 

            The term “qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project” has the meaning given the term “qualified enhanced oil recovery project” by section 43(c)(2), by substituting “crude oil or natural gas” for “crude oil” in subparagraph (A)(i) thereof.

        (5) __Credit attributable to taxpayer__ 

            Any credit under this section shall be attributable to the person that captures and physically or contractually ensures the disposal of or the use as a tertiary injectant of the qualified carbon dioxide, except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

        (6) __Recapture__ 

            The Secretary shall, by regulations, provide for recapturing the benefit of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any qualified carbon dioxide which ceases to be captured, disposed of, or used as a tertiary injectant in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section.

        (7) __Inflation adjustment__ 

        In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2009, there shall be substituted for each dollar amount contained in subsection (a) an amount equal to the product of—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

            (B) the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting “2008” for “1990”.

    (e) __Application of section__ 

        The credit under this section shall apply with respect to qualified carbon dioxide before the end of the calendar year in which the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, certifies that 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide have been taken into account in accordance with subsection (a).
