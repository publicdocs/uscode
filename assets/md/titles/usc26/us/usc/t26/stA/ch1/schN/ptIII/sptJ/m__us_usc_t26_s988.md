    (a) __General rule__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter—

        (1) __Treatment as ordinary income or loss__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as otherwise provided in this section, any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a section 988 transaction shall be computed separately and treated as ordinary income or loss (as the case may be).

            (B) __Special rule for forward contracts, etc.__ 

                Except as provided in regulations, a taxpayer may elect to treat any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a forward contract, a futures contract, or option described in subsection (c)(1)(B)(iii) which is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer and which is not a part of a straddle (within the meaning of section 1092(c), without regard to paragraph (4) thereof) as capital gain or loss (as the case may be) if the taxpayer makes such election and identifies such transaction before the close of the day on which such transaction is entered into (or such earlier time as the Secretary may prescribe).

        (2) __Gain or loss treated as interest for certain purposes__ 

            To the extent provided in regulations, any amount treated as ordinary income or loss under paragraph (1) shall be treated as interest income or expense (as the case may be).

        (3) __Source__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as otherwise provided in regulations, in the case of any amount treated as ordinary income or loss under paragraph (1) (without regard to paragraph (1)(B)), the source of such amount shall be determined by reference to the residence of the taxpayer or the qualified business unit of the taxpayer on whose books the asset, liability, or item of income or expense is properly reflected.

            (B) __Residence__ 

            For purposes of this subpart—

                (i) __In general__ 

                The residence of any person shall be—

                    (I) in the case of an individual, the country in which such individual’s tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) is located,

                    (II) in the case of any corporation, partnership, trust, or estate which is a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), the United States, and

                    (III) in the case of any corporation, partnership, trust, or estate which is not a United States person, a country other than the United States.

                 If an individual does not have a tax home (as so defined), the residence of such individual shall be the United States if such individual is a United States citizen or a resident alien and shall be a country other than the United States if such individual is not a United States citizen or a resident alien.

                (ii) __Exception__ 

                    In the case of a qualified business unit of any taxpayer (including an individual), the residence of such unit shall be the country in which the principal place of business of such qualified business unit is located.

                (iii) __Special rule for partnerships__ 

                    To the extent provided in regulations, in the case of a partnership, the determination of residence shall be made at the partner level.

            (C) __Special rule for certain related party loans__ 

            Except to the extent provided in regulations, in the case of a loan by a United States person or a related person to a 10-percent owned foreign corporation which is denominated in a currency other than the dollar and bears interest at a rate at least 10 percentage points higher than the Federal mid-term rate (determined under section 1274(d)) at the time such loan is entered into, the following rules shall apply:

                (i) For purposes of section 904 only, such loan shall be marked to market on an annual basis.

                (ii) Any interest income earned with respect to such loan for the taxable year shall be treated as income from sources within the United States to the extent of any loss attributable to clause (i).

                For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “related person” has the meaning given such term by section 954(d)(3), except that such section shall be applied by substituting “United States person” for “controlled foreign corporation” each place such term appears.

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Foreign currency gain__ 

            The term “foreign currency gain” means any gain from a section 988 transaction to the extent such gain does not exceed gain realized by reason of changes in exchange rates on or after the booking date and before the payment date.

        (2) __Foreign currency loss__ 

            The term “foreign currency loss” means any loss from a section 988 transaction to the extent such loss does not exceed the loss realized by reason of changes in exchange rates on or after the booking date and before the payment date.

        (3) __Special rule for certain contracts, etc.__

                        Except as provided in regulations, in the case of a qualified fund, any bank forward contract, any foreign currency futures contract traded on a foreign exchange, or to the extent provided in regulations any similar instrument, which is not otherwise a section 1256 contract shall be treated as a section 1256 contract for purposes of section 1256.

                    (II) __Gains and losses treated as short-term__ 

                        In the case of any instrument treated as a section 1256 contract under subclause (I), subparagraph (A) of section 1256(a)(3) shall be applied by substituting “100 percent” for “40 percent” (and subparagraph (B) of such section shall not apply).

                (v) __Special rules for clause (iii)(I)__ 

                    (I) __Certain general partners__ 

                        The interest of a general partner in the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20-percent ownership requirements of clause (iii)(I) for any taxable year of the partnership if, for the taxable year of the partner in which such partnership taxable year ends, such partner (and each corporation filing a consolidated return with such partner) had no ordinary income or loss from a section 988 transaction which is foreign currency gain or loss (as the case may be).

                    (II) __Treatment of incentive compensation__ 

                        For purposes of clause (iii)(I), any income allocable to a general partner as incentive compensation based on profits rather than capital shall not be taken into account in determining such partner’s interest in the profits of the partnership.

                    (III) __Treatment of tax-exempt partners__ 

                        Except as provided in regulations, the interest of a partner in the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20-percent ownership requirements of clause (iii)(I) if none of the income of such partner from such partnership is subject to tax under this chapter (whether directly or through 1 or more pass-thru entities).

                    (IV) __Look-thru rule__ 

                        In determining whether the requirements of clause (iii)(I) are met with respect to any partnership, except to the extent provided in regulations, any interest in such partnership held by another partnership shall be treated as held proportionately by the partners in such other partnership.

    (d) __Treatment of 988 hedging transactions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            To the extent provided in regulations, if any section 988 transaction is part of a 988 hedging transaction, all transactions which are part of such 988 hedging transaction shall be integrated and treated as a single transaction or otherwise treated consistently for purposes of this subtitle. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of whether any transaction is a section 988 transaction shall be determined without regard to whether such transaction would otherwise be marked-to-market under section 475 or 1256 and such term shall not include any transaction with respect to which an election is made under subsection (a)(1)(B). Sections 475, 1092, and 1256 shall not apply to a transaction covered by this subsection.

        If—

            (A) nonfunctional currency is disposed of by an individual in any transaction, and

            (B) such transaction is a personal transaction,

            no gain shall be recognized for purposes of this subtitle by reason of changes in exchange rates after such currency was acquired by such individual and before such disposition. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the gain which would otherwise be recognized on the transaction exceeds $200.

        (3) __Personal transactions__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “personal transaction” means any transaction entered into by an individual, except that such term shall not include any transaction to the extent that expenses properly allocable to such transaction meet the requirements of—

            (A) section 162 (other than traveling expenses described in subsection (a)(2) thereof), or
