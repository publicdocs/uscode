        (2) __Alternative tax in case of capital gains__ 

        If for any taxable year any political organization has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by paragraph (1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such a tax is less than the tax imposed by paragraph (1)) which shall consist of the sum of—

    (c) __Political organization taxable income defined__ 

        (1) __Taxable income defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the political organization taxable income of any organization for any taxable year is an amount equal to the excess (if any) of—

            (B) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), computed with the modifications provided in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Modifications__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) there shall be allowed a specific deduction of $100,
