## § 469. Passive activity losses and credits limited

    (a) __Disallowance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If for any taxable year the taxpayer is described in paragraph (2), neither—

            (A) the passive activity loss, nor

            (B) the passive activity credit,

            for the taxable year shall be allowed.

        (2) __Persons described__ 

        The following are described in this paragraph:

            (A) any individual, estate, or trust,

            (B) any closely held C corporation, and

            (C) any personal service corporation.

    (b) __Disallowed loss or credit carried to next year__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this section, any loss or credit from an activity which is disallowed under subsection (a) shall be treated as a deduction or credit allocable to such activity in the next taxable year.

    (c) __Passive activity defined__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “passive activity” means any activity—

            (A) which involves the conduct of any trade or business, and

            (B) in which the taxpayer does not materially participate.

        (2) __Passive activity includes any rental activity__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (7), the term “passive activity” includes any rental activity.

        (3) __Working interests in oil and gas property__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The term “passive activity” shall not include any working interest in any oil or gas property which the taxpayer holds directly or through an entity which does not limit the liability of the taxpayer with respect to such interest.

            (B) __Income in subsequent years__ 

                If any taxpayer has any loss for any taxable year from a working interest in any oil or gas property which is treated as a loss which is not from a passive activity, then any net income from such property (or any property the basis of which is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such property) for any succeeding taxable year shall be treated as income of the taxpayer which is not from a passive activity. If the preceding sentence applies to the net income from any property for any taxable year, any credits allowable under subpart B (other than section 27(a)) or D of part IV of subchapter A for such taxable year which are attributable to such property shall be treated as credits not from a passive activity to the extent the amount of such credits does not exceed the regular tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is allocable to such net income.

        (4) __Material participation not required for paragraphs (2) and (3)__ 

            Paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be applied without regard to whether or not the taxpayer materially participates in the activity.

        (5) __Trade or business includes research and experimentation activity__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term “trade or business” includes any activity involving research or experimentation (within the meaning of section 174).

        (6) __Activity in connection with trade or business or production of income__ 

        To the extent provided in regulations, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term “trade or business” includes—

            (A) any activity in connection with a trade or business, or

            (B) any activity with respect to which expenses are allowable as a deduction under section 212.

        (7) __Special rules for taxpayers in real property business__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If this paragraph applies to any taxpayer for a taxable year—

                (i) paragraph (2) shall not apply to any rental real estate activity of such taxpayer for such taxable year, and

                (ii) this section shall be applied as if each interest of the taxpayer in rental real estate were a separate activity.

                Notwithstanding clause (ii), a taxpayer may elect to treat all interests in rental real estate as one activity. Nothing in the preceding provisions of this subparagraph shall be construed as affecting the determination of whether the taxpayer materially participates with respect to any interest in a limited partnership as a limited partner.

            (B) __Taxpayers to whom paragraph applies__ 

            This paragraph shall apply to a taxpayer for a taxable year if—

                (i) more than one-half of the personal services performed in trades or businesses by the taxpayer during such taxable year are performed in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates, and

                (ii) such taxpayer performs more than 750 hours of services during the taxable year in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates.

                In the case of a joint return, the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied if and only if either spouse separately satisfies such requirements. For purposes of the preceding sentence, activities in which a spouse materially participates shall be determined under subsection (h).

            (C) __Real property trade or business__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “real property trade or business” means any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business.

            (D) __Special rules for subparagraph (B)__ 

                (i) __Closely held C corporations__ 

                    In the case of a closely held C corporation, the requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be treated as met for any taxable year if more than 50 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for such taxable year are derived from real property trades or businesses in which the corporation materially participates.

                (ii) __Personal services as an employee__ 

                    For purposes of subparagraph (B), personal services performed as an employee shall not be treated as performed in real property trades or businesses. The preceding sentence shall not apply if such employee is a 5-percent owner (as defined in section 416(i)(1)(B)) in the employer.

    (d) __Passive activity loss and credit defined__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Passive activity loss__ 

        The term “passive activity loss” means the amount (if any) by which—

            (A) the aggregate losses from all passive activities for the taxable year, exceed

            (B) the aggregate income from all passive activities for such year.

        (2) __Passive activity credit__ 

        The term “passive activity credit” means the amount (if any) by which—

    (e) __Special rules for determining income or loss from a passive activity__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Certain income not treated as income from passive activity__

            There shall not be taken into account—

                (i)

                 any—

                    (I) gross income from interest, dividends, annuities, or royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business,

                    (II) expenses (other than interest) which are clearly and directly allocable to such gross income, and

                    (III) interest expense properly allocable to such gross income, and

                (ii)

                 gain or loss not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business which is attributable to the disposition of property—

                    (I) producing income of a type described in clause (i), or

                    (II) held for investment.

                For purposes of clause (ii), any interest in a passive activity shall not be treated as property held for investment.

            (B) __Return on working capital__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), any income, gain, or loss which is attributable to an investment of working capital shall be treated as not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

        (2) __Passive losses of certain closely held corporations may offset active income__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If a closely held C corporation (other than a personal service corporation) has net active income for any taxable year, the passive activity loss of such taxpayer for such taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph)—

                (i) shall be allowable as a deduction against net active income, and

                (ii) shall not be taken into account under subsection (a) to the extent so allowable as a deduction.

                A similar rule shall apply in the case of any passive activity credit of the taxpayer.

            (B) __Net active income__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “net active income” means the taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year determined without regard to—

                (i) any income or loss from a passive activity, and

                (ii) any item of gross income, expense, gain, or loss described in paragraph (1)(A).

        (3) __Compensation for personal services__ 

            Earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)(A)) shall not be taken into account in computing the income or loss from a passive activity for any taxable year.

        (4) __Dividends reduced by dividends received deduction__ 

            For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), income from dividends shall be reduced by the amount of any dividends received deduction under section 243 or 245.

    (f) __Treatment of former passive activities__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        If an activity is a former passive activity for any taxable year—

            (A) any unused deduction allocable to such activity under subsection (b) shall be offset against the income from such activity for the taxable year,

            (B) any unused credit allocable to such activity under subsection (b) shall be offset against the regular tax liability (computed after the application of paragraph (1)) allocable to such activity for the taxable year, and

            (C) any such deduction or credit remaining after the application of subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall continue to be treated as arising from a passive activity.

        (2) __Change in status of closely held C corporation or personal service corporation__ 

            If a taxpayer ceases for any taxable year to be a closely held C corporation or personal service corporation, this section shall continue to apply to losses and credits to which this section applied for any preceding taxable year in the same manner as if such taxpayer continued to be a closely held C corporation or personal service corporation, whichever is applicable.

        (3) __Former passive activity__ 

        The term “former passive activity” means any activity which, with respect to the taxpayer—

            (A) is not a passive activity for the taxable year, but

            (B) was a passive activity for any prior taxable year.

    (g) __Dispositions of entire interest in passive activity__ 

    If during the taxable year a taxpayer disposes of his entire interest in any passive activity (or former passive activity), the following rules shall apply:

        (1) __Fully taxable transaction__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If all gain or loss realized on such disposition is recognized, the excess of—

                (i) any loss from such activity for such taxable year (determined after the application of subsection (b)), over

                (ii) any net income or gain for such taxable year from all other passive activities (determined after the application of subsection (b)),

                shall be treated as a loss which is not from a passive activity.

            (B) __Subparagraph (A) not to apply to disposition involving related party__ 

                If the taxpayer and the person acquiring the interest bear a relationship to each other described in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1), then subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any loss of the taxpayer until the taxable year in which such interest is acquired (in a transaction described in subparagraph (A)) by another person who does not bear such a relationship to the tax­payer.

            (C) __Income from prior years__ 

                To the extent provided in regulations, income or gain from the activity for preceding taxable years shall be taken into account under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the taxable year to the extent necessary to prevent the avoidance of this section.

        (2) __Disposition by death__ 

        If an interest in the activity is transferred by reason of the death of the taxpayer—

            (A)

             paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to losses described in paragraph (1)(A) to the extent such losses are greater than the excess (if any) of—

                (i) the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee, over

                (ii) the adjusted basis of such property immediately before the death of the taxpayer, and

            (B) any losses to the extent of the excess described in subparagraph (A) shall not be allowed as a deduction for any taxable year.

        (3) __Installment sale of entire interest__ 

            In the case of an installment sale of an entire interest in an activity to which section 453 applies, paragraph (1) shall apply to the portion of such losses for each taxable year which bears the same ratio to all such losses as the gain recognized on such sale during such taxable year bears to the gross profit from such sale (realized or to be realized when payment is completed).

    (h) __Material participation defined__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        A taxpayer shall be treated as materially participating in an activity only if the taxpayer is involved in the operations of the activity on a basis which is—

            (B) continuous, and

            (C) substantial.

        (2) __Interests in limited partnerships__

        (4) __Certain closely held C corporations and personal service corporations__ 

        A closely held C corporation or personal service corporation shall be treated as materially participating in an activity only if—

            (B) in the case of a closely held C corporation (other than a personal service corporation), the requirements of section 465(c)(7)(C) (without regard to clause (iv)) are met with respect to such activity.

        (5) __Participation by spouse__ 

            In determining whether a taxpayer materially participates, the participation of the spouse of the taxpayer shall be taken into account.

    (i) __$25,000 offset for rental real estate activities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of any natural person, subsection (a) shall not apply to that portion of the passive activity loss or the deduction equivalent (within the meaning of subsection (j)(5)) of the passive activity credit for any taxable year which is attributable to all rental real estate activities with respect to which such individual actively participated in such taxable year (and if any portion of such loss or credit arose in another taxable year, in such other taxable year).

            (B) __Special phase-out of rehabilitation credit__ 

                In the case of any portion of the passive activity credit for any taxable year which is attributable to the rehabilitation credit determined under section 47, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “$200,000” for “$100,000”.

        (5) __Deduction equivalent__
