        (7) __Special rule for spouses who are not active participants__ 

        If this subsection applies to an individual for any taxable year solely because their spouse is an active participant, then, in applying this subsection to the individual (but not their spouse)—

            (A) the applicable dollar amount under paragraph (3)(B)(i) shall be $150,000; and

            (B) the amount applicable under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall be $10,000.
