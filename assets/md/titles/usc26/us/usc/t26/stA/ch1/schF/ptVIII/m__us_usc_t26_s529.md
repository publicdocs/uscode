## § 529. Qualified tuition programs

    (a) __General rule__ 

        A qualified tuition program shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such program shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable organizations).

    (b) __Qualified tuition program__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified tuition program” means a program established and maintained by a State or agency or instrumentality thereof or by 1 or more eligible educational institutions—

            (A)

             under which a person—

                (i) may purchase tuition credits or certificates on behalf of a designated beneficiary which entitle the beneficiary to the waiver or payment of qualified higher education expenses of the beneficiary, or

                (ii) in the case of a program established and maintained by a State or agency or instrumentality thereof, may make contributions to an account which is established for the purpose of meeting the qualified higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account, and

            (B) which meets the other requirements of this subsection.

            Except to the extent provided in regulations, a program established and maintained by 1 or more eligible educational institutions shall not be treated as a qualified tuition program unless such program provides that amounts are held in a qualified trust and such program has received a ruling or determination that such program meets the applicable requirements for a qualified tuition program. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “qualified trust” means a trust which is created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of designated beneficiaries and with respect to which the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (5) of section 408(a) are met.

        (2) __Cash contributions__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified tuition program unless it provides that purchases or contributions may only be made in cash.

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified tuition program unless it provides separate accounting for each designated beneficiary.

        (4) __Limited investment direction__

        (5) __No pledging of interest as security__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified tuition program if it allows any interest in the program or any portion thereof to be used as security for a loan.

        (6) __Prohibition on excess contributions__ 

            A program shall not be treated as a qualified tuition program unless it provides adequate safeguards to prevent contributions on behalf of a designated beneficiary in excess of those necessary to provide for the qualified higher education expenses of the beneficiary.

    (c) __Tax treatment of designated beneficiaries and contributors__ 

        (1) __In general__

            Any contribution to a qualified tuition program on behalf of any designated beneficiary—

                (i) shall be treated as a completed gift to such beneficiary which is not a future interest in property, and

                (ii) shall not be treated as a qualified transfer under section 2503(e).

                    No amount shall be includible in gross income under subparagraph (A) by reason of a distribution which consists of providing a benefit to the distributee which, if paid for by the distributee, would constitute payment of a qualified higher education expense.

                (ii) __Cash distributions__ 

                In the case of distributions not described in clause (i), if—

                    (I) such distributions do not exceed the qualified higher education expenses (reduced by expenses described in clause (i)), no amount shall be includible in gross income, and
