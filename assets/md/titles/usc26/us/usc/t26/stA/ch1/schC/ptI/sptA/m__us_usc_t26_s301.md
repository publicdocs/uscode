## § 301. Distributions of property

    (a) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a)) made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock shall be treated in the manner provided in subsection (c).

    (b) __Amount distributed__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            For purposes of this section, the amount of any distribution shall be the amount of money received, plus the fair market value of the other property received.

        (2) __Reduction for liabilities__ 

        The amount of any distribution determined under paragraph (1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by—

            (A) the amount of any liability of the corporation assumed by the shareholder in connection with the distribution, and

            (B) the amount of any liability to which the property received by the shareholder is subject immediately before, and immediately after, the distribution.

        (3) __Determination of fair market value__ 

            For purposes of this section, fair market value shall be determined as of the date of the distribution.

    (c) __Amount taxable__ 

    In the case of a distribution to which subsection (a) applies—

        (1) __Amount constituting dividend__ 

            That portion of the distribution which is a dividend (as defined in section 316) shall be included in gross income.

        (2) __Amount applied against basis__ 

            That portion of the distribution which is not a dividend shall be applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock.

        (3) __Amount in excess of basis__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), that portion of the distribution which is not a dividend, to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.

            (B) __Distributions out of increase in value accrued before__  __March 1, 1913__ 

                That portion of the distribution which is not a dividend, to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock and to the extent that it is out of increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913, shall be exempt from tax.

    (d) __Basis__ 

        The basis of property received in a distribution to which subsection (a) applies shall be the fair market value of such property.

    (e) __Special rule for certain distributions received by 20 percent corporate shareholder__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations, solely for purposes of determining the taxable income of any 20 percent corporate shareholder (and its adjusted basis in the stock of the distributing corporation), section 312 shall be applied with respect to the distributing corporation as if it did not contain subsections (k) and (n) thereof.

        (2) __20 percent corporate shareholder__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “20 percent corporate shareholder” means, with respect to any distribution, any corporation which owns (directly or through the application of section 318)—

            (A) stock in the corporation making the distribution possessing at least 20 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or

            (B) at least 20 percent of the total value of all stock of the distributing corporation (except nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends),

            but only if, but for this subsection, the distributee corporation would be entitled to a deduction under section 243, 244, or 245 with respect to such distribution.

        (3) __Application of section 312(n)(7) not affected__
