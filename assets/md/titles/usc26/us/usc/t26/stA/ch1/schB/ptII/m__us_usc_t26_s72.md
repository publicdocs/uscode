## § 72. Annuities; certain proceeds of endowment and life insurance contracts

    (a) __General rules for annuities__ 

        (1) __Income inclusion__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, gross income includes any amount received as an annuity (whether for a period certain or during one or more lives) under an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract.

        (2) __Partial annuitization__ 

        If any amount is received as an annuity for a period of 10 years or more or during one or more lives under any portion of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract—

            (A) such portion shall be treated as a separate contract for purposes of this section,

            (B) for purposes of applying subsections (b), (c), and (e), the investment in the contract shall be allocated pro rata between each portion of the contract from which amounts are received as an annuity and the portion of the contract from which amounts are not received as an annuity, and

            (C) a separate annuity starting date under subsection (c)(4) shall be determined with respect to each portion of the contract from which amounts are received as an annuity.

    (b) __Exclusion ratio__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Gross income does not include that part of any amount received as an annuity under an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract which bears the same ratio to such amount as the investment in the contract (as of the annuity starting date) bears to the expected return under the contract (as of such date).

        (2) __Exclusion limited to investment__ 

            The portion of any amount received as an annuity which is excluded from gross income under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the unrecovered investment in the contract immediately before the receipt of such amount.

        (3) __Deduction where annuity payments cease before entire investment recovered__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If—

                (i) after the annuity starting date, payments as an annuity under the contract cease by reason of the death of an annuitant, and

                (ii) as of the date of such cessation, there is unrecovered investment in the contract,

                the amount of such unrecovered investment (in excess of any amount specified in subsection (e)(5) which was not included in gross income) shall be allowed as a deduction to the annuitant for his last taxable year.

            (B) __Payments to other persons__ 

                In the case of any contract which provides for payments meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (c)(2), the deduction under subparagraph (A) shall be allowed to the person entitled to such payments for the taxable year in which such payments are received.

            (C) __Net operating loss deductions provided__ 

                For purposes of section 172, a deduction allowed under this paragraph shall be treated as if it were attributable to a trade or business of the taxpayer.

        (4) __Unrecovered investment__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the unrecovered investment in the contract as of any date is—

            (A) the investment in the contract (determined without regard to subsection (c)(2)) as of the annuity starting date, reduced by

            (B) the aggregate amount received under the contract on or after such annuity starting date and before the date as of which the determination is being made, to the extent such amount was excludable from gross income under this subtitle.

    (c) __Definitions__ 

        (1) __Investment in the contract__ 

        For purposes of subsection (b), the investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date is—

            (A) the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract, minus

            (B) the aggregate amount received under the contract before such date, to the extent that such amount was excludable from gross income under this subtitle or prior income tax laws.

        (2) __Adjustment in investment where there is refund feature__ 

        If—

            (A) the expected return under the contract depends in whole or in part on the life expectancy of one or more individuals;

            (B) the contract provides for payments to be made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of an annuitant) on or after the death of the annuitant or annuitants; and

            (C) such payments are in the nature of a refund of the consideration paid,

            then the value (computed without discount for interest) of such payments on the annuity starting date shall be subtracted from the amount determined under paragraph (1). Such value shall be computed in accordance with actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary. For purposes of this paragraph and of subsection (e)(2)(A), the term “refund of the consideration paid” includes amounts payable after the death of an annuitant by reason of a provision in the contract for a life annuity with minimum period of payments certain, but (if part of the consideration was contributed by an employer) does not include that part of any payment to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the annuitant) which is not attributable to the consideration paid by the employee for the contract as determined under paragraph (1)(A).

        (3) __Expected return__ 

        For purposes of subsection (b), the expected return under the contract shall be determined as follows:

            (A) __Life expectancy__ 

                If the expected return under the contract, for the period on and after the annuity starting date, depends in whole or in part on the life expectancy of one or more individuals, the expected return shall be computed with reference to actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary.

            (B) __Installment payments__ 

                If subparagraph (A) does not apply, the expected return is the aggregate of the amounts receivable under the contract as an annuity.

        (4) __Annuity starting date__ 

            For purposes of this section, the annuity starting date in the case of any contract is the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity under the contract; except that if such date was before January 1, 1954, then the annuity starting date is January 1, 1954.

    (d) __Special rules for qualified employer retirement plans__ 

        (1) __Simplified method of taxing annuity payments__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Method of recovering investment in contract__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Gross income shall not include so much of any monthly annuity payment under a qualified employer retirement plan as does not exceed the amount obtained by dividing—

                    (I) the investment in the contract (as of the annuity starting date), by

                    (II) the number of anticipated payments determined under the table contained in clause (iii) (or, in the case of a contract to which subsection (c)(3)(B) applies, the number of monthly annuity payments under such contract).

                (ii) __Certain rules made applicable__ 

                    Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.

                (iii) __Number of anticipated payments__

            If, in connection with the commencement of annuity payments under any qualified employer retirement plan, the taxpayer receives a lump-sum payment—

                (i) such payment shall be taxable under subsection (e) as if received before the annuity starting date, and

                (ii) the investment in the contract for purposes of this paragraph shall be determined as if such payment had been so received.

            (E) __Exception__ 

                This paragraph shall not apply in any case where the primary annuitant has attained age 75 on the annuity starting date unless there are fewer than 5 years of guaranteed payments under the annuity.

            (F) __Adjustment where annuity payments not on monthly basis__

        Any amount to which this subsection applies—

            (A) if received on or after the annuity starting date, shall be included in gross income, or

            (B)

             if received before the annuity starting date—

                (i) shall be included in gross income to the extent allocable to income on the contract, and

                (ii) shall not be included in gross income to the extent allocable to the investment in the contract.

        (3) __Allocation of amounts to income and investment__

        (9) __Extension of paragraph (2)(B) to qualified tuition programs and Coverdell education savings accounts__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, paragraph (2)(B) shall apply to amounts received under a qualified tuition program (as defined in section 529(b)) or under a Coverdell education savings account (as defined in section 530(b)). The rule of paragraph (8)(B) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.

        (10) __Treatment of modified endowment contracts__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (5)(C), in the case of any modified endowment contract (as defined in section 7702A)—

                (i) paragraphs (2)(B) and (4)(A) shall apply, and

                (ii) in applying paragraph (4)(A), “any person” shall be substituted for “an individual”.

            (B) __Treatment of certain burial contracts__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), paragraph (4)(A) shall not apply to any assignment (or pledge) of a modified endowment contract if such assignment (or pledge) is solely to cover the payment of expenses referred to in section 7702(e)(2)(C)(iii) and if the maximum death benefit under such contract does not exceed $25,000.

        (11) __Special rules for certain combination contracts providing long-term care insurance__

    In computing, for purposes of subsection (c)(1)(A), the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract, and for purposes of subsection (e)(6), the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid, amounts contributed by the employer shall be included, but only to the extent that—

        (1) such amounts were includible in the gross income of the employee under this subtitle or prior income tax laws; or

        (2) if such amounts had been paid directly to the employee at the time they were contributed, they would not have been includible in the gross income of the employee under the law applicable at the time of such contribution.

        Paragraph (2) shall not apply to amounts which were contributed by the employer after December 31, 1962, and which would not have been includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of the application of section 911 if such amounts had been paid directly to the employee at the time of contribution. The preceding sentence shall not apply to amounts which were contributed by the employer, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to provide pension or annuity credits, to the extent such credits are attributable to services performed before January 1, 1963, and are provided pursuant to pension or annuity plan provisions in existence on March 12, 1962, and on that date applicable to such services, or to the extent such credits are attributable to services performed as a foreign missionary (within the meaning of section 403(b)(2)(D)(iii), as in effect before the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001).

        (1) for purposes of this section, only the actual value of such consideration, plus the amount of the premiums and other consideration paid by the transferee after the transfer, shall be taken into account in computing the aggregate amount of the premiums or other consideration paid for the contract;

        (2) for purposes of subsection (c)(1)(B), there shall be taken into account only the aggregate amount received under the contract by the transferee before the annuity starting date, to the extent that such amount was excludable from gross income under this subtitle or prior income tax laws; and

        (3) the annuity starting date is January 1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which the transferee received an amount under the contract as an annuity, whichever is the later.

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “transferee” includes a beneficiary of, or the estate of, the transferee.

    (h) __Option to receive annuity in lieu of lump sum__ 

    If—

        (1) a contract provides for payment of a lump sum in full discharge of an obligation under the contract, subject to an option to receive an annuity in lieu of such lump sum;

        (2) the option is exercised within 60 days after the day on which such lump sum first became payable; and

        (3) part or all of such lump sum would (but for this subsection) be includible in gross income by reason of subsection (e)(1),

        then, for purposes of this subtitle, no part of such lump sum shall be considered as includible in gross income at the time such lump sum first became payable.
