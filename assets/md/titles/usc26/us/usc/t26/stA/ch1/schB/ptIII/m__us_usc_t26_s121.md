## § 121. Exclusion of gain from sale of principal residence

    (a) __Exclusion__ 

        Gross income shall not include gain from the sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer’s principal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more.

    (b) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The amount of gain excluded from gross income under subsection (a) with respect to any sale or exchange shall not exceed $250,000.

            (A) __$500,000 Limitation for certain joint returns__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “$500,000” for “$250,000” if—

                (ii) both spouses meet the use requirements of subsection (a) with respect to such property; and

                (iii) neither spouse is ineligible for the benefits of subsection (a) with respect to such property by reason of paragraph (3).

            (B) __Other joint returns__ 

                If such spouses do not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A), the limitation under paragraph (1) shall be the sum of the limitations under paragraph (1) to which each spouse would be entitled if such spouses had not been married. For purposes of the preceding sentence, each spouse shall be treated as owning the property during the period that either spouse owned the property.

        (3) __Application to only 1 sale or exchange every 2 years__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Gain allocated to periods of nonqualified use__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), gain shall be allocated to periods of nonqualified use based on the ratio which—

                (i) the aggregate periods of nonqualified use during the period such property was owned by the taxpayer, bears to

                (ii) the period such property was owned by the taxpayer.

                (ii) subsection (b)(3), and

            (B) such sale or exchange is by reason of a change in place of employment, health, or, to the extent provided in regulations, unforeseen circumstances.

    (d) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __Joint returns__ 

            If a husband and wife make a joint return for the taxable year of the sale or exchange of the property, subsections (a) and (c) shall apply if either spouse meets the ownership and use requirements of subsection (a) with respect to such property.

        (5) __Involuntary conversions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this section, the destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property shall be treated as the sale of such property.

            (B) __Application of section 1033__

            (C) __Property acquired after involuntary conversion__ 

                If the basis of the property sold or exchanged is determined (in whole or in part) under section 1033(b) (relating to basis of property acquired through involuntary conversion), then the holding and use by the taxpayer of the converted property shall be treated as holding and use by the taxpayer of the property sold or exchanged.

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 109–135, title IV, § 403(ee)(1)][/us/pl/109/135/s403/ee/1], (nn), Dec. 21, 2005, [119 Stat. 2631][/us/stat/119/2631], 2632, which directed that subsec. (d) of this section be amended by redesignating the paragraph (10) relating to property acquired from a decedent as paragraph (11), effective as if included in the provisions to which such amendment relates of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, [Pub. L. 108–357][/us/pl/108/357], was executed as the probable intent of Congress by redesignating as paragraph (11) the paragraph (10) directed to be added to subsec. (d) of this section by [Pub. L. 107–16, § 542(c)][/us/pl/107/16/s542/c], (f)(1), applicable to estates of decedents dying after Dec. 31, 2009. See Codification note, 2001, 2003, and 2005 Amendment notes, and Effective Date of 2005 Amendment note below.

    [Pub. L. 108–121, title I, § 101(a)][/us/pl/108/121/s101/a], (b)(1), Nov. 11, 2003, [117 Stat. 1336][/us/stat/117/1336], which directed that subsec. (d) of this section be amended by redesignating paragraph (9) as (10) and adding a new paragraph (9), effective as if included in the amendments made by section 312 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, [Pub. L. 105–34][/us/pl/105/34], could not literally be executed insofar as it directed the redesignation because subsec. (d), as amended by [Pub. L. 105–34][/us/pl/105/34], did not contain a paragraph (9). However, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, the amendment was executed by redesignating as paragraph (10) the paragraph (9) directed to be added to subsec. (d) of this section by [Pub. L. 107–16, § 542(c)][/us/pl/107/16/s542/c], (f)(1), applicable to estates of decedents dying after Dec. 31, 2009. See Codification note above and 2001, 2003, and 2005 Amendment notes and Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note below.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 121 was renumbered [section 140 of this title][/us/usc/t26/s140].

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (d)(11). [Pub. L. 111–312][/us/pl/111/312] amended subsec. (d) to read as if amendment by [Pub. L. 107–16, § 542(c)][/us/pl/107/16/s542/c], which originally added par. (9), had never been enacted. See Codification notes above and 2001 Amendment note and Effective Date of 2010 Amendment note below. Prior to amendment, par. (11) read as follows: “Property acquired from a decedent.—The exclusion under this section shall apply to property sold by—

    “(A) the estate of a decedent,

    “(B) any individual who acquired such property from the decedent (within the meaning of section 1022), and

    “(C) a trust which, immediately before the death of the decedent, was a qualified revocable trust (as defined in section 645(b)(1)) established by the decedent,

    determined by taking into account the ownership and use by the decedent.”

    2008—Subsec. (b)(4). [Pub. L. 110–289][/us/pl/110/289] added par. (4) relating to exclusion of gain allocated to nonqualified use.

    Subsec. (d)(9)(C)(vi). [Pub. L. 110–245, § 113(b)][/us/pl/110/245/s113/b], struck out heading and text of cl. (vi). Text read as follows: “An employee of the intelligence community shall not be treated as serving on qualified extended duty unless such duty is at a duty station located outside the United States.”
