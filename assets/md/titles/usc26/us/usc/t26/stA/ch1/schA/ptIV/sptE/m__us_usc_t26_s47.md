## § 47. Rehabilitation credit

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of section 46, the rehabilitation credit for any taxable year is the sum of—

        (1) 10 percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to any qualified rehabilitated building other than a certified historic structure, and

        (2) 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to any certified historic structure.

    (b) __When expenditures taken into account__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to any qualified rehabilitated building shall be taken into account for the taxable year in which such qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service.

        (2) __Coordination with subsection (d)__ 

            The amount which would (but for this paragraph) be taken into account under paragraph (1) with respect to any qualified rehabilitated building shall be reduced (but not below zero) by any amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures taken into account under subsection (d) by the taxpayer or a predecessor of the taxpayer (or, in the case of a sale and leaseback described in section 50(a)(2)(C), by the lessee), to the extent any amount so taken into account has not been required to be recaptured under section 50(a).

    (c) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Qualified rehabilitated building__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “qualified rehabilitated building” means any building (and its structural components) if—

                (i) such building has been substantially rehabilitated,

                (ii) such building was placed in service before the beginning of the rehabilitation,

                (iii)

                 in the case of any building other than a certified historic structure, in the rehabilitation process—

                    (I) 50 percent or more of the existing external walls of such building are retained in place as external walls,

                    (II) 75 percent or more of the existing external walls of such building are retained in place as internal or external walls, and

                    (III) 75 percent or more of the existing internal structural framework of such building is retained in place, and

                (iv) depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable with respect to such building.

            (B) __Building must be first placed in service before 1936__ 

                In the case of a building other than a certified historic structure, a building shall not be a qualified rehabilitated building unless the building was first placed in service before 1936.

            (C) __Substantially rehabilitated defined__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), a building shall be treated as having been substantially rehabilitated only if the qualified rehabilitation expenditures during the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer (at the time and in the manner prescribed by regulation) and ending with or within the taxable year exceed the greater of—

                    (I) the adjusted basis of such building (and its structural components), or

                    (II) $5,000.

                 The adjusted basis of the building (and its structural components) shall be determined as of the beginning of the 1st day of such 24-month period, or of the holding period of the building, whichever is later. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of the beginning of the holding period shall be made without regard to any reconstruction by the taxpayer in connection with the rehabilitation.

                (ii) __Special rule for phased rehabilitation__ 

                    In the case of any rehabilitation which may reasonably be expected to be completed in phases set forth in architectural plans and specifications completed before the rehabilitation begins, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting “60-month period” for “24-month period”.

                    (I) __In general__

                    (II) __Clause not to apply for purposes of paragraph (1)(C)__

                    (II) which is certified by the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary as meeting substantially all of the requirements for the listing of districts in the National Register.

    (d) __Progress expenditures__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of any building to which this subsection applies, except as provided in paragraph (3)—

            (A) if such building is self-rehabilitated property, any qualified rehabilitation expenditure with respect to such building shall be taken into account for the taxable year for which such expenditure is properly chargeable to capital account with respect to such building, and

            (B) if such building is not self-rehabilitated property, any qualified rehabilitation expenditure with respect to such building shall be taken into account for the taxable year in which paid.

        (2) __Property to which subsection applies__ 

            (A) __In general__

                (i) the normal rehabilitation period for such building is 2 years or more, and

                (ii) it is reasonable to expect that such building will be a qualified rehabilitated building in the hands of the taxpayer when it is placed in service.

        (3) __Special rules for applying paragraph (1)__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)—

            (A) __Component parts, etc.__ 

            Property which is to be a component part of, or is otherwise to be included in, any building to which this subsection applies shall be taken into account—

                (i) at a time not earlier than the time at which it becomes irrevocably devoted to use in the building, and

                (ii) as if (at the time referred to in clause (i)) the taxpayer had expended an amount equal to that portion of the cost to the taxpayer of such component or other property which, for purposes of this subpart, is properly chargeable (during such taxable year) to capital account with respect to such building.

            (B) __Certain borrowing disregarded__ 

                Any amount borrowed directly or indirectly by the taxpayer from the person rehabilitating the property for him shall not be treated as an amount expended for such rehabilitation.

                (ii) __Carryover of certain amounts__ 

                In the case of a building which is not a self-rehabilitated building, if for the taxable year—

                    (I) the amount which (but for clause (i)) would have been taken into account under paragraph (1)(B) exceeds the limitation of clause (i), then the amount of such excess shall be taken into account under paragraph (1)(B) for the succeeding taxable year, or
