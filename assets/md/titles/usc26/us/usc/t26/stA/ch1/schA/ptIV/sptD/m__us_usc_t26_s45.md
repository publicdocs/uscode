    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of section 38, the renewable electricity production credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the product of—

        (1) 1.5 cents, multiplied by

        (2)

         the kilowatt hours of electricity—

            (A)

             produced by the taxpayer—

                (i) from qualified energy resources, and

                (ii) at a qualified facility during the 10-year period beginning on the date the facility was originally placed in service, and

            (B) sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year.

    (b) __Limitations and adjustments__ 

        (1) __Phaseout of credit__ 

        The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

            (A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds 8 cents, bears to

            (B) 3 cents.

        (2) __Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation__ 

            The 1.5 cent amount in subsection (a), the 8 cent amount in paragraph (1), the $4.375 amount in subsection (e)(8)(A), the $2 amount in subsection (e)(8)(D)(ii)(I), and in subsection (e)(8)(B)(i) the reference price of fuel used as a feedstock (within the meaning of subsection (c)(7)(A)) in 2002 shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. If any amount as increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent.

        (3) __Credit reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy financing, and other credits__ 

        The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and the lesser of ½ or a fraction—

            (A)

             the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable year and all prior taxable years, of—

                (i) grants provided by the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State for use in connection with the project,

                (ii) proceeds of an issue of State or local government obligations used to provide financing for the project the interest on which is exempt from tax under section 103,

                (iii) the aggregate amount of subsidized energy financing provided (directly or indirectly) under a Federal, State, or local program provided in connection with the project, and

                (iv) the amount of any other credit allowable with respect to any property which is part of the project, and

            (B) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of additions to the capital account for the project for the taxable year and all prior taxable years.

            The amounts under the preceding sentence for any taxable year shall be determined as of the close of the taxable year. This paragraph shall not apply with respect to any facility described in subsection (d)(2)(A)(ii).
