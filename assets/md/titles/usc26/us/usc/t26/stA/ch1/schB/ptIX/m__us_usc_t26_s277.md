## § 277. Deductions incurred by certain membership organizations in transactions with members

    (a) __General rule__ 

        In the case of a social club or other membership organization which is operated primarily to furnish services or goods to members and which is not exempt from taxation, deductions for the taxable year attributable to furnishing services, insurance, goods, or other items of value to members shall be allowed only to the extent of income derived during such year from members or transactions with members (including income derived during such year from institutes and trade shows which are primarily for the education of members). If for any taxable year such deductions exceed such income, the excess shall be treated as a deduction attributable to furnishing services, insurance, goods, or other items of value to members paid or incurred in the succeeding taxable year. The deductions provided by sections 243 and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall not be allowed to any organization to which this section applies for the taxable year.

    (b) __Exceptions__ 

    Subsection (a) shall not apply to any organization—

        (1) which for the taxable year is subject to taxation under subchapter H or L,

        (2) which has made an election before October 9, 1969, under section 456(c) or which is affiliated with such an organization,

        (3) which for each day of any taxable year is a national securities exchange subject to regulation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a contract market subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, or

        (4) which is engaged primarily in the gathering and distribution of news to its members for publication.
