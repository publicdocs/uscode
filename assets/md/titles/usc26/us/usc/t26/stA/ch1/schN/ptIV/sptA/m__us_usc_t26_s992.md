## § 992. Requirements of a domestic international sales corporation

    (a) __Definition of “DISC” and “former DISC”__ 

        (1) __DISC__ 

        For purposes of this title, the term “DISC” means, with respect to any taxable year, a corporation which is incorporated under the laws of any State and satisfies the following conditions for the taxable year:

            (A) 95 percent or more of the gross receipts (as defined in section 993(f)) of such corporation consist of qualified export receipts (as defined in section 993(a)),

            (B) the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets (as defined in section 993(b)) of the corporation at the close of the taxable year equals or exceeds 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted basis of all assets of the corporation at the close of the taxable year,

            (C) such corporation does not have more than one class of stock and the par or stated value of its outstanding stock is at least $2,500 on each day of the taxable year, and

            (D) the corporation has made an election pursuant to subsection (b) to be treated as a DISC and such election is in effect for the taxable year.

        (2) __Status as DISC after having filed a return as a DISC__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe regulations setting forth the conditions under and the extent to which a corporation which has filed a return as a DISC for a taxable year shall be treated as a DISC for such taxable year for all purposes of this title, notwithstanding the fact that the corporation has failed to satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1).

        (3) __“Former DISC”__ 

            For purposes of this title, the term “former DISC” means, with respect to any taxable year, a corporation which is not a DISC for such year but was a DISC in a preceding taxable year and at the beginning of the taxable year has undistributed previously taxed income or accumulated DISC income.

    (b) __Election__ 

        (1) __Election__ 

            (A) An election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC shall be made by such corporation for a taxable year at any time during the 90–day period immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year, except that the Secretary may give his consent to the making of an election at such other times as he may designate.

            (B) Such election shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall be valid only if all persons who are shareholders in such corporation on the first day of the first taxable year for which such election is effective consent to such election.

        (2) __Effect of election__ 

            If a corporation makes an election under paragraph (1), then the provisions of this part shall apply to such corporation for the taxable year of the corporation for which made and for all succeeding taxable years and shall apply to each person who at any time is a shareholder of such corporation for all periods on or after the first day of the first taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective.

        (3) __Termination of election__ 

            (A) __Revocation__ 

            An election under this subsection made by any corporation may be terminated by revocation of such election for any taxable year of the corporation after the first taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective. A termination under this paragraph shall be effective with respect to such election—

                (i) for the taxable year in which made, if made at any time during the first 90 days of such taxable year, or

                (ii) for the taxable year following the taxable year in which made, if made after the close of such 90 days,

                and for all succeeding taxable years of the corporation. Such termination shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulations.

            (B) __Continued failure to be DISC__ 

                If a corporation is not a DISC for each of any 5 consecutive taxable years of the corporation for which an election under this subsection is effective, the election shall be terminated and not be in effect for any taxable year of the corporation after such 5th year.

    (c) __Distributions to meet qualification requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to the conditions provided by paragraph (2), a corporation which for a taxable year does not satisfy a condition specified in paragraph (1)(A) (relating to gross receipts) or (1)(B) (relating to assets) of subsection (a) shall nevertheless be deemed to satisfy such condition for such year if it makes a pro rata distribution of property after the close of the taxable year to its shareholders (designated at the time of such distribution as a distribution to meet qualification requirements) with respect to their stock in an amount which is equal to—

            (A) if the condition of subsection (a)(1)(A) is not satisfied, the portion of such corporation’s taxable income attributable to its gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts for such year,

            (B) if the condition of subsection (a)(1)(B) is not satisfied, the fair market value of those assets which are not qualified export assets on the last day of such taxable year, or

            (C) if neither of such conditions is satisfied, the sum of the amounts required by subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2) __Reasonable cause for failure__ 

        The conditions under paragraph (1) shall be deemed satisfied in the case of a distribution made under such paragraph—

            (A) if the failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), and the failure to make such distribution prior to the date on which made, are due to reasonable cause; and

            (B) the corporation pays, within the 30–day period beginning with the day on which such distribution is made, to the Secretary, if such corporation makes such distribution after the 15th day of the 9th months after the close of the taxable year, an amount determined by multiplying (i) the amount equal to 4½ percent of such distribution, by (ii) the number of its taxable years which begin after the taxable year with respect to which such distribution is made and before such distribution is made. For purposes of this title, any payment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be treated as interest.

        (3) __Certain distributions made within 8½ months after close of taxable year deemed for reasonable cause__ 

        A distribution made on or before the 15th day of the 9th month after the close of the taxable year shall be deemed for reasonable cause for purposes of paragraph (2)(A) if—

            (A) at least 70 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for such taxable year consist of qualified export receipts, and

            (B) the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets held by the corporation on the last day of each month of the taxable year equals or exceeds 70 percent of the sum of the adjusted basis of all assets held by the corporation on such day.

    (d) __Ineligible corporations__ 

    The following corporations shall not be eligible to be treated as a DISC—

        (1) a corporation exempt from tax by reason of section 501,

        (2) a personal holding company (as defined in section 542),

        (3) a financial institution to which section 581 applies,

        (4) an insurance company subject to the tax imposed by subchapter L,

        (5) a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)),

        (6) a China Trade Act corporation receiving the special deduction provided in section 941(a), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  or

        (7) an S corporation.

    (e) __Coordination with personal holding company provisions in case of certain produced film rents__ 

    If—

        (1) a corporation (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as “subsidiary”) was established to take advantage of the provisions of this part, and

        (2) a second corporation (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as “parent”) throughout the taxable year owns directly at least 80 percent of the stock of the subsidiary,

        then, for purposes of applying subsection (d)(2) and section 541 (relating to personal holding company tax) to the subsidiary for the taxable year, there shall be taken into account under section 543(a)(5) (relating to produced film rents) any interest in a film acquired by the parent and transferred to the subsidiary as if such interest were acquired by the subsidiary at the time it was acquired by the parent.
