## § 1201. Alternative tax for corporations

    (a) __General rule__ 

    If for any taxable year a corporation has a net capital gain and any rate of tax imposed by section 11, 511, or 831(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable) exceeds 35 percent (determined without regard to the last 2 sentences of section 11(b)(1)), then, in lieu of any such tax, there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such sections) which shall consist of the sum of—

        (1) a tax computed on the taxable income reduced by the amount of the net capital gain, at the rates and in the manner as if this subsection had not been enacted, plus

        (2) a tax of 35 percent of the net capital gain (or, if less, taxable income).

    (b) __Special rate for qualified timber gains__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If, for any taxable year beginning in 2016, a corporation has both a net capital gain and qualified timber gain—

            (A) subsection (a) shall apply to such corporation for the taxable year without regard to whether the applicable tax rate exceeds 35 percent, and

            (B)

             the tax computed under subsection (a)(2) shall be equal to the sum of—

                (i)

                 23.8 percent of the least of—

                    (I) qualified timber gain,

                    (II) net capital gain, or

                    (III) taxable income, plus

                (ii) 35 percent of the excess (if any) of taxable income over the sum of the amounts for which a tax was determined under subsection (a)(1) and clause (i).

        (2) __Qualified timber gain__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified timber gain” means, with respect to any taxpayer for any taxable year, the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the sum of the taxpayer’s gains described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 631 for such year, over

            (B) the sum of the taxpayer’s losses described in such subsections for such year.

            For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), only timber held more than 15 years shall be taken into account.

    (c) __Cross references__
