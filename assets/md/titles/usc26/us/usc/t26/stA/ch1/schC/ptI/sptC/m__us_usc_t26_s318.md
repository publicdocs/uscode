## § 318. Constructive ownership of stock

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of those provisions of this subchapter to which the rules contained in this section are expressly made applicable—

        (1) __Members of family__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            An individual shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for—

                (i) his spouse (other than a spouse who is legally separated from the individual under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance), and

                (ii) his children, grandchildren, and parents.

            (B) __Effect of adoption__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), a legally adopted child of an individual shall be treated as a child of such individual by blood.

        (2) __Attribution from partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporations__ 

            (A) __From partnerships and estates__ 

                Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partnership or estate shall be considered as owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.

            (B) __From trusts__ 

                (i) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a trust (other than an employees’ trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a)) shall be considered as owned by its beneficiaries in proportion to the actuarial interest of such beneficiaries in such trust.

                (ii) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any portion of a trust of which a person is considered the owner under subpart E of part I of subchapter J (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners) shall be considered as owned by such person.

            (C) __From corporations__ 

                If 50 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, such person shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such corporation, in that proportion which the value of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all the stock in such corporation.

        (3) __Attribution to partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporations__ 

            (A) __To partnerships and estates__ 

                Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partner or a beneficiary of an estate shall be considered as owned by the partnership or estate.

            (B) __To trusts__ 

                (i) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a beneficiary of a trust (other than an employees’ trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a)) shall be considered as owned by the trust, unless such beneficiary’s interest in the trust is a remote contingent interest. For purposes of this clause, a contingent interest of a beneficiary in a trust shall be considered remote if, under the maximum exercise of discretion by the trustee in favor of such beneficiary, the value of such interest, computed actuarially, is 5 percent or less of the value of the trust property.

                (ii) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a person who is considered the owner of any portion of a trust under subpart E of part I of subchapter J (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners), shall be considered as owned by the trust.

            (C) __To corporations__ 

                If 50 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, such corporation shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such person.

        (4) __Options__ 

            If any person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this paragraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.

        (5) __Operating rules__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), stock constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), shall, for purposes of applying paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), be considered as actually owned by such person.

            (B) __Members of family__ 

                Stock constructively owned by an individual by reason of the application of paragraph (1) shall not be considered as owned by him for purposes of again applying paragraph (1) in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.

            (C) __Partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporations__ 

                Stock constructively owned by a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation by reason of the application of paragraph (3) shall not be considered as owned by it for purposes of applying paragraph (2) in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.

            (D) __Option rule in lieu of family rule__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, if stock may be considered as owned by an individual under paragraph (1) or (4), it shall be considered as owned by him under paragraph (4).

            (E) __S corporation treated as partnership__ 

            For purposes of this subsection—

                (i) an S corporation shall be treated as a partnership, and

                (ii) any shareholder of the S corporation shall be treated as a partner of such partnership.

                The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of determining whether stock in the S corporation is constructively owned by any person.
