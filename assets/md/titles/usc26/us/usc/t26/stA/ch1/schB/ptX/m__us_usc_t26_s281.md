             such corporation shall not be considered to have received or accrued—

                (i) the portion of any liability of any railroad corporation, with respect to related terminal services provided by such corporation, which is discharged by crediting such liability with an amount of related terminal income, or

                (ii) the portion of any charge which would be made by such corporation for related terminal services provided by it, but which is not made as a result of taking related terminal income into account in computing such charge; and

            (B) no deduction otherwise allowable under this chapter shall be disallowed as a result of any discharge of liability described in subparagraph (A)(i) or as a result of any computation of charges in the manner described in subparagraph (A)(ii).

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            In the case of any taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this section, paragraph (1) shall not apply to the extent that it would (but for this paragraph) operate to create (or increase) a net operating loss for the terminal railroad corporation for the taxable year.

    (b) __Computation of taxable income of shareholders__ 

        Subject to the limitation in subsection (a)(2), in computing the taxable income of any shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation, no amount shall be considered to have been received or accrued or paid or incurred by such shareholder as a result of any discharge of liability described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) or as a result of any computation of charges in the manner described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii).

    (c) __Agreement required__ 

        In the case of any taxable year, subsections (a) and (b) shall apply with respect to any discharge of liability described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), and to any computation of charges in the manner described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii), only if such discharge or computation (as in the case may be) was provided for in a written agreement, to which all of the shareholders of the terminal railroad corporation were parties, entered into before the beginning of such taxable year.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—
