    (a) __Taxes paid by foreign corporation treated as paid by domestic corporation__ 

    For purposes of this subpart, a domestic corporation which owns 10 percent or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation from which it receives dividends in any taxable year shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of such foreign corporation’s post-1986 foreign income taxes as—

        (1) the amount of such dividends (determined without regard to section 78), bears to

        (2) such foreign corporation’s post-1986 undistributed earnings.

    (b) __Deemed taxes increased in case of certain lower tier corporations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If—

            (A) any foreign corporation is a member of a qualified group, and

            (B) such foreign corporation owns 10 percent or more of the voting stock of another member of such group from which it receives dividends in any taxable year,

            such foreign corporation shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of such other member’s post-1986 foreign income taxes as would be determined under subsection (a) if such foreign corporation were a domestic corporation.

        (2) __Qualified group__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “qualified group” means—

            (A) the foreign corporation described in subsection (a), and

            (B)

             any other foreign corporation if—

                (ii) the foreign corporation described in subsection (a) is the first tier corporation in such chain, and

                (iii) such other corporation is not below the sixth tier in such chain.

            The term “qualified group” shall not include any foreign corporation below the third tier in the chain referred to in clause (i) unless such foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) and the domestic corporation is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in such foreign corporation. Paragraph (1) shall apply to those taxes paid by a member of the qualified group below the third tier only with respect to periods during which it was a controlled foreign corporation.

        (3) __Special rule where foreign corporation first qualifies after__  __December 31, 1986__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the 1st day on which the requirements of subparagraph (B) are met with respect to any foreign corporation is in a taxable year of such corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, the post-1986 undistributed earnings and the post-1986 foreign income taxes of such foreign corporation shall be determined by taking into account only periods beginning on and after the 1st day of the 1st taxable year in which such requirements are met.

        (5) __Accounting periods__ 

            In the case of a foreign corporation the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes of which are determined on the basis of an accounting period of less than 1 year, the word “year” as used in this subsection shall be construed to mean such accounting period.

        (6) __Treatment of distributions from earnings before 1987__

            In the case of any dividend paid by a foreign corporation out of accumulated profits (as defined in this section as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) for taxable years beginning before the 1st taxable year taken into account in determining the post-1986 undistributed earnings of such corporation—

                (i) this section (as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) shall not apply, but

                (ii) this section (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act) shall apply.
