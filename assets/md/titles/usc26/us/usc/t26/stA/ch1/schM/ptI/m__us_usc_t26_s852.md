## § 852. Taxation of regulated investment companies and their shareholders

    (a) __Requirements applicable to regulated investment companies__ 

    The provisions of this part (other than subsection (c) of this section) shall not be applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year unless—

        (1)

         the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but without regard to capital gain dividends) equals or exceeds the sum of—

            (A) 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for the taxable year determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(D); and

            (B) 90 percent of the excess of (i) its interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265, 171(a)(2), and

        (2)

         either—

            (A) the provisions of this part applied to the investment company for all taxable years ending on or after November 8, 1983, or

            (B) as of the close of the taxable year, the investment company has no earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions of this part (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) did not apply to it.

        The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the regulated investment company establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4982.

    (b) __Method of taxation of companies and shareholders__ 

        (1) __Imposition of tax on regulated investment companies__ 

            There is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon the investment company taxable income of every regulated investment company a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In the case of a regulated investment company which is a personal holding company (as defined in section 542) or which fails to comply for the taxable year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of its stock, such tax shall be computed at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).

        (2) __Investment company taxable income__ 

        The investment company taxable income shall be the taxable income of the regulated investment company adjusted as follows:

            (A) There shall be excluded the amount of the net capital gain, if any.

            (B) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.

            (C) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) in subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.

            (D) the  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be capitalized. </sup></sup>  deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.

            (E) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).

            (F) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.

            (G) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by subsections (d)(2) and (i) of section 851 for the taxable year.

        (3) __Capital gains__ 

            (A) __Imposition of tax__ 

                There is hereby imposed for each taxable year in the case of every regulated investment company a tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a), on the excess, if any, of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.

            (B) __Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders__ 

                A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.

            (C) __Definition of capital gain dividend__ 

            For purposes of this part—

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (ii), a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is reported by the company as a capital gain dividend in written statements furnished to its shareholders.

                (ii) __Excess reported amounts__ 

                If the aggregate reported amount with respect to the company for any taxable year exceeds the net capital gain of the company for such taxable year, a capital gain dividend is the excess of—

                    (I) the reported capital gain dividend amount, over

                    (II) the excess reported amount which is allocable to such reported capital gain dividend amount.

                (iii) __Allocation of excess reported amount__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Except as provided in subclause (II), the excess reported amount (if any) which is allocable to the reported capital gain dividend amount is that portion of the excess reported amount which bears the same ratio to the excess reported amount as the reported capital gain dividend amount bears to the aggregate reported amount.

                    (II) __Special rule for noncalendar year taxpayers__ 

                        In the case of any taxable year which does not begin and end in the same calendar year, if the post-December reported amount equals or exceeds the excess reported amount for such taxable year, subclause (I) shall be applied by substituting “post-December reported amount” for “aggregate reported amount” and no excess reported amount shall be allocated to any dividend paid on or before December 31 of such taxable year.

                (iv) __Definitions__ 

                For purposes of this subparagraph—

                    (I) __Reported capital gain dividend amount__ 

                        The term “reported capital gain dividend amount” means the amount reported to its shareholders under clause (i) as a capital gain dividend.

                    (II) __Excess reported amount__ 

                        The term “excess reported amount” means the excess of the aggregate reported amount over the net capital gain of the company for the taxable year.

                    (III) __Aggregate reported amount__ 

                        The term “aggregate reported amount” means the aggregate amount of dividends reported by the company under clause (i) as capital gain dividends for the taxable year (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 855).

                    (IV) __Post-December reported amount__ 

                        The term “post-December reported amount” means the aggregate reported amount determined by taking into account only dividends paid after December 31 of the taxable year.

                (v) __Adjustment for determinations__ 

                    If there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A) for the taxable year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), the company may, subject to the limitations of this subparagraph, increase the amount of capital gain dividends reported under clause (i).

                (vi) __Special rule for losses late in the calendar year__ 

                For special rule for certain losses after October 31, see paragraph (8).

            (D) __Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains__ 

                (i) Every shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of the company’s taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the company’s taxable year falls, such amount as the company shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after close of its taxable year, but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the company to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.

                (ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholder shall be allowed credit or refund, as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.

                (iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the shareholder shall be increased, with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).

                (iv) In the event of such designation the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the regulated investment company within 30 days after close of its taxable year.

                (v) The earnings and profits of such regulated investment company, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

            (E) __Certain distributions__ 

            In the case of a distribution to which section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount of such distribution which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for the shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)—

                (i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder’s long-term capital gains, and

                (ii) shall be included in such shareholder’s gross income as a dividend from the regulated investment company.

        (4) __Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less__ 

            (A) __Loss attributable to capital gain dividend__ 

            If—

                (i) subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share is to be treated as long-term capital gain, and

                (ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,

                then any loss (to the extent not disallowed under subparagraph (B)) on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.

            (B) __Loss attributable to exempt-interest dividend__ 

            If—

                (i) a shareholder of a regulated investment company receives an exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and

                (ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,

                then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount of such exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed.

            (C) __Determination of holding periods__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, in determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock—

                (i) the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply, and

                (ii) there shall not be taken into account any day which is more than 6 months after the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend.

            (D) __Losses incurred under a periodic liquidation plan__ 

                To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of stock in a regulated investment company pursuant to a plan which provides for the periodic liquidation of such shares.

            (E) __Exception to holding period requirement for certain regularly declared exempt-interest dividends__ 

                (i) __Daily dividend companies__ 

                    Except as otherwise provided by regulations, subparagraph (B) shall not apply with respect to a regular dividend paid by a regulated investment company which declares exempt-interest dividends on a daily basis in an amount equal to at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest and distributes such dividends on a monthly or more frequent basis.

                (ii) __Authority to shorten required holding period with respect to other companies__ 

                    In the case of a regulated investment company (other than a company described in clause (i)) which regularly distributes at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest, the Secretary may by regulations prescribe that subparagraph (B) (and subparagraph (C) to the extent it relates to subparagraph (B)) shall be applied on the basis of a holding period requirement shorter than 6 months; except that such shorter holding period requirement shall not be shorter than the greater of 31 days or the period between regular distributions of exempt-interest dividends.

        (5) __Exempt-interest dividends__ 

        If, at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value (as defined in section 851(c)(4)) of the total assets of the regulated investment company consists of obligations described in section 103(a), such company shall be qualified to pay exempt-interest dividends, as defined herein, to its shareholders.

            (A) __Definition of exempt-interest dividend__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (ii), an exempt-interest dividend is any dividend or part thereof (other than a capital gain dividend) paid by a regulated investment company and reported by the company as an exempt-interest dividend in written statements furnished to its shareholders.

                (ii) __Excess reported amounts__ 

                If the aggregate reported amount with respect to the company for any taxable year exceeds the exempt interest of the company for such taxable year, an exempt-interest dividend is the excess of—

                    (I) the reported exempt-interest dividend amount, over

                    (II) the excess reported amount which is allocable to such reported exempt-interest dividend amount.

                (iii) __Allocation of excess reported amount__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Except as provided in subclause (II), the excess reported amount (if any) which is allocable to the reported exempt-interest dividend amount is that portion of the excess reported amount which bears the same ratio to the excess reported amount as the reported exempt-interest dividend amount bears to the aggregate reported amount.

                    (II) __Special rule for noncalendar year taxpayers__ 

                        In the case of any taxable year which does not begin and end in the same calendar year, if the post-December reported amount equals or exceeds the excess reported amount for such taxable year, subclause (I) shall be applied by substituting “post-December reported amount” for “aggregate reported amount” and no excess reported amount shall be allocated to any dividend paid on or before December 31 of such taxable year.

            (B) __Treatment of exempt-interest dividends by shareholders__ 

            An exempt-interest dividend shall be treated by the shareholders for all purposes of this subtitle as an item of interest excludable from gross income under section 103(a). Such purposes include but are not limited to—

                (i) the determination of gross income and taxable income,

                (ii) the determination of distributable net income under subchapter J,

        (8) __Elective deferral of certain late-year losses__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, a regulated investment company may elect for any taxable year to treat any portion of any qualified late-year loss for such taxable year as arising on the first day of the following taxable year for purposes of this title.

        section 562(c) (relating to preferential dividends) shall not apply to a distribution by such trust to a holder of an interest in such trust in redemption of part or all of such interest, with respect to the capital gain net income of such trust attributable to such redemption.

    (e) __Procedures similar to deficiency dividend procedures made applicable__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If—

            (A) there is a determination that the provisions of this part do not apply to an investment company for any taxable year (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “non-RIC year”), and

            (B) such investment company meets the distribution requirements of paragraph (2) with respect to the non-RIC year,

            for purposes of applying subsection (a)(2) to subsequent taxable years, the provisions of this part shall be treated as applying to such investment company for the non-RIC year. If the determination under subparagraph (A) is solely as a result of the failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2), the preceding sentence shall also apply for purposes of applying subsection (a)(2) to the non-RIC year and the amount referred to in paragraph (2)(A)(i) shall be the portion of the accumulated earnings and profits which resulted in such failure.

        (2) __Distribution requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The distribution requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any non-RIC year if, within the 90-day period beginning on the date of the determination (or within such longer period as the Secretary may permit), the investment company makes 1 or more qualified designated distributions and the amount of such distributions is not less than the excess of—

                (i) the portion of the accumulated earnings and profits of the investment company (as of the date of the determination) which are attributable to the non-RIC year, over

                (ii) such distribution is designated (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) as being taken into account under this paragraph with respect to the non-RIC year.

            (C) __Effect on dividends paid deduction__ 

                Any qualified designated distribution shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for any taxable year.

        (3) __Interest charge__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If paragraph (1) applies to any non-RIC year of an investment company, such investment company shall pay interest at the underpayment rate established under section 6621—

                (ii)

                 for the period—

                    (I) which begins on the last day prescribed for payment of the tax imposed for the non-RIC year (determined without regard to extensions), and

                    (II) which ends on the date the determination is made.

            (B) __Coordination with subtitle F__ 

                Any interest payable under subparagraph (A) may be assessed and collected at any time during the period during which any tax imposed for the taxable year in which the determination is made may be assessed and collected.

        (4) __Provision not to apply in the case of fraud__ 

            The provisions of this subsection shall not apply if the determination contains a finding that the failure to meet any requirement of this part was due to fraud with intent to evade tax.

        (5) __Determination__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “determination” has the meaning given to such term by section 860(e). Such term also includes a determination by the investment company filed with the Secretary that the provisions of this part do not apply to the investment company for a taxable year.

    (f) __Treatment of certain load charges__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If—

            (A) the taxpayer incurs a load charge in acquiring stock in a regulated investment company and, by reason of incurring such charge or making such acquisition, the taxpayer acquires a reinvestment right,

            (B) such stock is disposed of before the 91st day after the date on which such stock was acquired, and

            (C) the taxpayer acquires, during the period beginning on the date of the disposition referred to in subparagraph (B) and ending on January 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year that includes the date of such disposition, stock in such regulated investment company or in another regulated investment company and the otherwise applicable load charge is reduced by reason of the reinvestment right,

            the load charge referred to in subparagraph (A) (to the extent it does not exceed the reduction referred to in subparagraph (C)) shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of gain or loss on the disposition referred to in subparagraph (B). To the extent such charge is not taken into account in determining the amount of such gain or loss, such charge shall be treated as incurred in connection with the acquisition referred to in subparagraph (C) (including for purposes of reapplying this paragraph).

        (2) __Definitions and special rules__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Load charge__ 

                The term “load charge” means any sales or similar charge incurred by a person in acquiring stock of a regulated investment company. Such term does not include any charge incurred by reason of the reinvestment of a dividend.

            (B) __Reinvestment right__ 

                The term “reinvestment right” means any right to acquire stock of 1 or more regulated investment companies without the payment of a load charge or with the payment of a reduced charge.
