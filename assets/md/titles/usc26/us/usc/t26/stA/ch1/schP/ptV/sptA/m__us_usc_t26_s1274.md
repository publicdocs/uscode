## § 1274. Determination of issue price in the case of certain debt instruments issued for property

    (a) __In general__ 

    In the case of any debt instrument to which this section applies, for purposes of this subpart, the issue price shall be—

        (1) where there is adequate stated interest, the stated principal amount, or

        (2) in any other case, the imputed principal amount.

    (b) __Imputed principal amount__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (3), the imputed principal amount of any debt instrument shall be equal to the sum of the present values of all payments due under such debt instrument.

        (2) __Determination of present value__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the present value of a payment shall be determined in the manner provided by regulations prescribed by the Secretary—

            (A) as of the date of the sale or exchange, and

            (B) by using a discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate, compounded semiannually.

        (3) __Fair market value rule in potentially abusive situations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of any potentially abusive situation, the imputed principal amount of any debt instrument received in exchange for property shall be the fair market value of such property adjusted to take into account other consideration involved in the transaction.

            (B) __Potentially abusive situation defined__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “potentially abusive situation” means—

                (i) a tax shelter (as defined in section 6662(d)(2)(C)(iii)), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and

                (ii)

                 any other situation which, by reason of—

                    (I) recent sales transactions,

                    (II) nonrecourse financing,

                    (III) financing with a term in excess of the economic life of the property, or

                    (IV) other circumstances,

                 is of a type which the Secretary specifies by regulations as having potential for tax avoidance.

    (c) __Debt instruments to which section applies__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, this section shall apply to any debt instrument given in consideration for the sale or exchange of property if—

             the stated redemption price at maturity for such debt instrument exceeds—

                (i) where there is adequate stated interest, the stated principal amount, or

                (ii) in any other case, the imputed principal amount of such debt instrument determined under subsection (b), and

            (B) some or all of the payments due under such debt instrument are due more than 6 months after the date of such sale or exchange.

        (2) __Adequate stated interest__ 

            For purposes of this section, there is adequate stated interest with respect to any debt instrument if the stated principal amount for such debt instrument is less than or equal to the imputed principal amount of such debt instrument determined under subsection (b).

        (3) __Exceptions__ 

        This section shall not apply to—

            (A) __Sales for $1,000,000 or less of farms by individuals or small businesses__ 

                (i) __In general__

                    (II) by a corporation which as of the date of the sale or exchange is a small business corporation (as defined in section 1244(c)(3)), or

                    (III) by a partnership which as of the date of the sale or exchange meets requirements similar to those of section 1244(c)(3).

                (ii) __$1,000,000 limitation__ 

                    Clause (i) shall apply only if it can be determined at the time of the sale or exchange that the sales price cannot exceed $1,000,000. For purposes of the preceding sentence, all sales and exchanges which are part of the same transaction (or a series of related transactions) shall be treated as 1 sale or exchange.
