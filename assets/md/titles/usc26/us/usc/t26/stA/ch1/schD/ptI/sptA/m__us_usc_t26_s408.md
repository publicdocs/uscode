## § 408. Individual retirement accounts

    (a) __Individual retirement account__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “individual retirement account” means a trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:

        (1) Except in the case of a rollover contribution described in subsection (d)(3) in  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 457(e)(16), no contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash, and contributions will not be accepted for the taxable year on behalf of any individual in excess of the amount in effect for such taxable year under section 219(b)(1)(A).

        (2) The trustee is a bank (as defined in subsection (n)) or such other person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the manner in which such other person will administer the trust will be consistent with the requirements of this section.

        (3) No part of the trust funds will be invested in life insurance contracts.

        (4) The interest of an individual in the balance in his account is nonforfeitable.

        (5) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund.

        (6) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of section 401(a)(9) and the incidental death benefit requirements of section 401(a) shall apply to the distribution of the entire interest of an individual for whose benefit the trust is maintained.

    (b) __Individual retirement annuity__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “individual retirement annuity” means an annuity contract, or an endowment contract (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), issued by an insurance company which meets the following requirements:

        (1) The contract is not transferable by the owner.

        (2)

         Under the contract—

            (A) the premiums are not fixed,

            (B) the annual premium on behalf of any individual will not exceed the dollar amount in effect under section 219(b)(1)(A), and

            (C) any refund of premiums will be applied before the close of the calendar year following the year of the refund toward the payment of future premiums or the purchase of additional benefits.

        (3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of section 401(a)(9) and the incidental death benefit requirements of section 401(a) shall apply to the distribution of the entire interest of the owner.

        (4) The entire interest of the owner is nonforfeitable.

        Such term does not include such an annuity contract for any taxable year of the owner in which it is disqualified on the application of subsection (e) or for any subsequent taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, no contract shall be treated as an endowment contract if it matures later than the taxable year in which the individual in whose name such contract is purchased attains age 70½; if it is not for the exclusive benefit of the individual in whose name it is purchased or his beneficiaries; or if the aggregate annual premiums under all such contracts purchased in the name of such individual for any taxable year exceed the dollar amount in effect under section 219(b)(1)(A).

    (c) __Accounts established by employers and certain associations of employees__ 

    A trust created or organized in the United States by an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries, or by an association of employees (which may include employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) for the exclusive benefit of its members or their beneficiaries, shall be treated as an individual retirement account (described in subsection (a)), but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:

        (1) The trust satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a).

        (2) There is a separate accounting for the interest of each employee or member (or spouse of an employee or member).

        The assets of the trust may be held in a common fund for the account of all individuals who have an interest in the trust.

    (d) __Tax treatment of distributions__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement plan shall be included in gross income by the payee or distributee, as the case may be, in the manner provided under section 72.

        (2) __Special rules for applying section 72__ 

        For purposes of applying section 72 to any amount described in paragraph (1)—

            (A) all individual retirement plans shall be treated as 1 contract,

            (B) all distributions during any taxable year shall be treated as 1 distribution, and

            (C) the value of the contract, income on the contract, and investment in the contract shall be computed as of the close of the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.

            For purposes of subparagraph (C), the value of the contract shall be increased by the amount of any distributions during the calendar year.

        (3) __Rollover contribution__ 

        An amount is described in this paragraph as a rollover contribution if it meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B).

            (A) __In general__ 

            Paragraph (1) does not apply to any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity to the individual for whose benefit the account or annuity is maintained if—

                (i) the entire amount received (including money and any other property) is paid into an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract) for the benefit of such individual not later than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the payment or distribution; or

                (ii) the entire amount received (including money and any other property) is paid into an eligible retirement plan for the benefit of such individual not later than the 60th day after the date on which the payment or distribution is received, except that the maximum amount which may be paid into such plan may not exceed the portion of the amount received which is includible in gross income (determined without regard to this paragraph).

                For purposes of clause (ii), the term “eligible retirement plan” means an eligible retirement plan described in clause (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of section 402(c)(8)(B).

            (B) __Limitation__ 

                This paragraph does not apply to any amount described in subparagraph (A)(i) received by an individual from an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity if at any time during the 1-year period ending on the day of such receipt such individual received any other amount described in that subparagraph from an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity which was not includible in his gross income because of the application of this paragraph.

            (C) __Denial of rollover treatment for inherited accounts, etc.__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                In the case of an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity—

                    (I) this paragraph shall not apply to any amount received by an individual from such an account or annuity (and no amount transferred from such account or annuity to another individual retirement account or annuity shall be excluded from gross income by reason of such transfer), and

                    (II) such inherited account or annuity shall not be treated as an individual retirement account or annuity for purposes of determining whether any other amount is a rollover contribution.

                (ii) __Inherited individual retirement account or annuity__ 

                An individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity shall be treated as inherited if—

                    (I) the individual for whose benefit the account or annuity is maintained acquired such account by reason of the death of another individual, and

                    (II) such individual was not the surviving spouse of such other individual.

            (D) __Partial rollovers permitted__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    If any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity would meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the entire amount was not paid into an eligible plan as required by clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), such amount shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) to the extent it is paid into an eligible plan referred to in such clause not later than the 60th day referred to in such clause.

                (ii) __Eligible plan__ 

                    For purposes of clause (i), the term “eligible plan” means any account, annuity, contract, or plan referred to in subparagraph (A).

            (E) __Denial of rollover treatment for required distributions__ 

                This paragraph shall not apply to any amount to the extent such amount is required to be distributed under subsection (a)(6) or (b)(3).

            (F) __Frozen deposits__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of section 402(c)(7) (relating to frozen deposits) shall apply.

            (G) __Simple retirement accounts__ 

                In the case of any payment or distribution out of a simple retirement account (as defined in subsection (p)) to which section 72(t)(6) applies, this paragraph shall not apply unless such payment or distribution is paid into another simple retirement account.

            (H) __Application of section 72__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If—

                    (I) a distribution is made from an individual retirement plan, and

                    (II) a rollover contribution is made to an eligible retirement plan described in section 402(c)(8)(B)(iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) with respect to all or part of such distribution,

                 then, notwithstanding paragraph (2), the rules of clause (ii) shall apply for purposes of applying section 72.

                (ii) __Applicable rules__ 

                In the case of a distribution described in clause (i)—

                    (I) section 72 shall be applied separately to such distribution,

                    (II) notwithstanding the pro rata allocation of income on, and investment in, the contract to distributions under section 72, the portion of such distribution rolled over to an eligible retirement plan described in clause (i) shall be treated as from income on the contract (to the extent of the aggregate income on the contract from all individual retirement plans of the distributee), and

                    (III) appropriate adjustments shall be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year and subsequent taxable years.

            (I) __Waiver of 60-day requirement__ 

                The Secretary may waive the 60-day requirement under subparagraphs (A) and (D) where the failure to waive such requirement would be against equity or good conscience, including casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable control of the individual subject to such requirement.

        (4) __Contributions returned before due date of return__ 

        Paragraph (1) does not apply to the distribution of any contribution paid during a taxable year to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity if—

            (A) such distribution is received on or before the day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for filing such individual’s return for such taxable year,

            (B) no deduction is allowed under section 219 with respect to such contribution, and

            (C) such distribution is accompanied by the amount of net income attributable to such contribution.

            In the case of such a distribution, for purposes of section 61, any net income described in subparagraph (C) shall be deemed to have been earned and receivable in the taxable year in which such contribution is made.

        (5) __Distributions of excess contributions after due date for taxable year and certain excess rollover contributions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of any individual, if the aggregate contributions (other than rollover contributions) paid for any taxable year to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity do not exceed the dollar amount in effect under section 219(b)(1)(A), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the distribution of any such contribution to the extent that such contribution exceeds the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 for the taxable year for which the contribution was paid—

                (i) if such distribution is received after the date described in paragraph (4),

                (ii) but only to the extent that no deduction has been allowed under section 219 with respect to such excess contribution.

                If employer contributions on behalf of the individual are paid for the taxable year to a simplified employee pension, the dollar limitation of the preceding sentence shall be increased by the lesser of the amount of such contributions or the dollar limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) for such taxable year.

            (B) __Excess rollover contributions attributable to erroneous information__ 

            If—

                (i) the taxpayer reasonably relies on information supplied pursuant to subtitle F for determining the amount of a rollover contribution, but

                (ii) the information was erroneous,

                subparagraph (A) shall be applied by increasing the dollar limit set forth therein by that portion of the excess contribution which was attributable to such information.

            For purposes of this paragraph, the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 shall be computed without regard to section 219(g).

        (6) __Transfer of account incident to divorce__ 

            The transfer of an individual’s interest in an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity to his spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument described in subparagraph (A) of section 71(b)(2) is not to be considered a taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time of the transfer is to be treated as an individual retirement account of such spouse, and not of such individual. Thereafter such account or annuity for purposes of this subtitle is to be treated as maintained for the benefit of such spouse.

        (7) __Special rules for simplified employee pensions or simple retirement accounts__ 

            (A) __Transfer or rollover of contributions prohibited until deferral test met__ 

                Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection or section 72(t), paragraph (1) and section 72(t)(1) shall apply to the transfer or distribution from a simplified employee pension of any contribution under a salary reduction arrangement described in subsection (k)(6) (or any income allocable thereto) before a determination as to whether the requirements of subsection (k)(6)(A)(iii) are met with respect to such contribution.

            (B) __Certain exclusions treated as deductions__ 

                For purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) and section 4973, any amount excludable or excluded from gross income under section 402(h) or 402(k) shall be treated as an amount allowable or allowed as a deduction under section 219.

        (8) __Distributions for charitable purposes__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                So much of the aggregate amount of qualified charitable distributions with respect to a taxpayer made during any taxable year which does not exceed $100,000 shall not be includible in gross income of such taxpayer for such taxable year.

            (B) __Qualified charitable distribution__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “qualified charitable distribution” means any distribution from an individual retirement plan (other than a plan described in subsection (k) or (p))—

                (i) which is made directly by the trustee to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than any organization described in section 509(a)(3) or any fund or account described in section 4966(d)(2)), and

                (ii) which is made on or after the date that the individual for whose benefit the plan is maintained has attained age 70½.

                A distribution shall be treated as a qualified charitable distribution only to the extent that the distribution would be includible in gross income without regard to subparagraph (A).

            (C) __Contributions must be otherwise deductible__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, a distribution to an organization described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall be treated as a qualified charitable distribution only if a deduction for the entire distribution would be allowable under section 170 (determined without regard to subsection (b) thereof and this paragraph).

            (D) __Application of section 72__ 

                Notwithstanding section 72, in determining the extent to which a distribution is a qualified charitable distribution, the entire amount of the distribution shall be treated as includible in gross income without regard to subparagraph (A) to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate amount which would have been so includible if all amounts in all individual retirement plans of the individual were distributed during such taxable year and all such plans were treated as 1 contract for purposes of determining under section 72 the aggregate amount which would have been so includible. Proper adjustments shall be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year and subsequent taxable years.

            (E) __Denial of deduction__ 

                Qualified charitable distributions which are not includible in gross income pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be taken into account in determining the deduction under section 170.

            (F) __Termination__ 

                This paragraph shall not apply to distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013.

        (9) __Distribution for health savings account funding__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of an individual who is an eligible individual (as defined in section 223(c)) and who elects the application of this paragraph for a taxable year, gross income of the individual for the taxable year does not include a qualified HSA funding distribution to the extent such distribution is otherwise includible in gross income.

            (B) __Qualified HSA funding distribution__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “qualified HSA funding distribution” means a distribution from an individual retirement plan (other than a plan described in subsection (k) or (p)) of the employee to the extent that such distribution is contributed to the health savings account of the individual in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer.

            (C) __Limitations__ 

                (i) __Maximum dollar limitation__ 

                The amount excluded from gross income by subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the excess of—

                    (I) the annual limitation under section 223(b) computed on the basis of the type of coverage under the high deductible health plan covering the individual at the time of the qualified HSA funding distribution, over

                    (II) in the case of a distribution described in clause (ii)(II), the amount of the earlier qualified HSA funding distribution.

                (ii) __One-time transfer__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        Except as provided in subclause (II), an individual may make an election under subparagraph (A) only for one qualified HSA funding distribution during the lifetime of the individual. Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable.

                    (II) __Conversion from self-only to family coverage__ 

                        If a qualified HSA funding distribution is made during a month in a taxable year during which an individual has self-only coverage under a high deductible health plan as of the first day of the month, the individual may elect to make an additional qualified HSA funding distribution during a subsequent month in such taxable year during which the individual has family coverage under a high deductible health plan as of the first day of the subsequent month.

            (D) __Failure to maintain high deductible health plan coverage__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If, at any time during the testing period, the individual is not an eligible individual, then the aggregate amount of all contributions to the health savings account of the individual made under subparagraph (A)—

                    (I) shall be includible in the gross income of the individual for the taxable year in which occurs the first month in the testing period for which such individual is not an eligible individual, and

                    (II) the tax imposed by this chapter for any taxable year on the individual shall be increased by 10 percent of the amount which is so includible.

                (ii) __Exception for disability or death__ 

                    Subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) shall not apply if the individual ceased to be an eligible individual by reason of the death of the individual or the individual becoming disabled (within the meaning of section 72(m)(7)).

                (iii) __Testing period__ 

                    The term “testing period” means the period beginning with the month in which the qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed to a health savings account and ending on the last day of the 12th month following such month.

            (E) __Application of section 72__ 

                Notwithstanding section 72, in determining the extent to which an amount is treated as otherwise includible in gross income for purposes of subparagraph (A), the aggregate amount distributed from an individual retirement plan shall be treated as includible in gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate amount which would have been so includible if all amounts from all individual retirement plans were distributed. Proper adjustments shall be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year and subsequent taxable years.

    (e) __Tax treatment of accounts and annuities__ 

        (1) __Exemption from tax__ 

            Any individual retirement account is exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such account has ceased to be an individual retirement account by reason of paragraph (2) or (3). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account is subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations).

        (2) __Loss of exemption of account where employee engages in prohibited transaction__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If, during any taxable year of the individual for whose benefit any individual retirement account is established, that individual or his beneficiary engages in any transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to such account, such account ceases to be an individual retirement account as of the first day of such taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) the individual for whose benefit any account was established is treated as the creator of such account, and

                (ii) the separate account for any individual within an individual retirement account maintained by an employer or association of employees is treated as a separate individual retirement account.

            (B) __Account treated as distributing all its assets__ 

                In any case in which any account ceases to be an individual retirement account by reason of subparagraph (A) as of the first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection (d) applies as if there were a distribution on such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such first day).

        (3) __Effect of borrowing on annuity contract__ 

            If during any taxable year the owner of an individual retirement annuity borrows any money under or by use of such contract, the contract ceases to be an individual retirement annuity as of the first day of such taxable year. Such owner shall include in gross income for such year an amount equal to the fair market value of such contract as of such first day.

        (4) __Effect of pledging account as security__ 

            If, during any taxable year of the individual for whose benefit an individual retirement account is established, that individual uses the account or any portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used is treated as distributed to that individual.

        (5) __Purchase of endowment contract by individual retirement account__ 

        If the assets of an individual retirement account or any part of such assets are used to purchase an endowment contract for the benefit of the individual for whose benefit the account is established—

            (A) to the extent that the amount of the assets involved in the purchase are not attributable to the purchase of life insurance, the purchase is treated as a rollover contribution described in subsection (d)(3), and

            (B) to the extent that the amount of the assets involved in the purchase are attributable to the purchase of life, health, accident, or other insurance, such amounts are treated as distributed to that individual (but the provisions of subsection (f) do not apply).

        (6) __Commingling individual retirement account amounts in certain common trust funds and common investment funds__ 

            Any common trust fund or common investment fund of individual retirement account assets which is exempt from taxation under this subtitle does not cease to be exempt on account of the participation or inclusion of assets of a trust exempt from taxation under section 501(a) which is described in section 401(a).

    \[(f) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 99–514, title XI, § 1123(d)(2)__  __][/us/pl/99/514/s1123/d/2]__  __,__  __Oct. 22, 1986__  __,__  __[__  __100 Stat. 2475__  __][/us/stat/100/2475]__  __\]__

        This section shall be applied without regard to any community property laws.

    (h) __Custodial accounts__ 

        For purposes of this section, a custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such account are held by a bank (as defined in subsection (n)) or another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a trust, constitute an individual retirement account described in subsection (a). For purposes of this title, in the case of a custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the trustee thereof.

    (i) __Reports__ 

    The trustee of an individual retirement account and the issuer of an endowment contract described in subsection (b) or an individual retirement annuity shall make such reports regarding such account, contract, or annuity to the Secretary and to the individuals for whom the account, contract, or annuity is, or is to be, maintained with respect to contributions (and the years to which they relate), distributions aggregating $10 or more in any calendar year, and such other matters as the Secretary may require. The reports required by this subsection—

        (1) shall be filed at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes, and

    (j) __Increase in maximum limitations for simplified employee pensions__ 

        In the case of any simplified employee pension, subsections (a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall be applied by increasing the amounts contained therein by the amount of the limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A).

            (A) with respect to which the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection are met, and

            (B) if such account or annuity is part of a top-heavy plan (as defined in section 416), with respect to which the requirements of section 416(c)(2) are met.

        (2) __Participation requirements__ 

        This paragraph is satisfied with respect to a simplified employee pension for a year only if for such year the employer contributes to the simplified employee pension of each employee who—

            (B) has performed service for the employer during at least 3 of the immediately preceding 5 years, and

            (C) received at least $450 in compensation (within the meaning of section 414(q)(4)) from the employer for the year.

            For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration employees described in subparagraph (A) or (C) of section 410(b)(3). For purposes of any arrangement described in subsection (k)(6), any employee who is eligible to have employer contributions made on the employee’s behalf under such arrangement shall be treated as if such a contribution was made.

        (3) __Contributions may not discriminate in favor of the highly compensated, etc.__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to a simplified employee pension for a year if for such year the contributions made by the employer to simplified employee pensions for his employees do not discriminate in favor of any highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q)).

            (B) __Special rules__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), there shall be excluded from consideration employees described in subparagraph (A) or (C) of section 410(b)(3).

            (C) __Contributions must bear uniform relationship to total compensation__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), and except as provided in subparagraph (D), employer contributions to simplified employee pensions (other than contributions under an arrangement described in paragraph (6)) shall be considered discriminatory unless contributions thereto bear a uniform relationship to the compensation (not in excess of the first $200,000) of each employee maintaining a simplified employee pension.

            (D) __Permitted disparity__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (C), the rules of section 401(l)(2) shall apply to contributions to simplified employee pensions (other than contributions under an arrangement described in paragraph (6)).

        (4) __Withdrawals must be permitted__ 

        A simplified employee pension meets the requirements of this paragraph only if—

            (A) employer contributions thereto are not conditioned on the retention in such pension of any portion of the amount contributed, and

            (B) there is no prohibition imposed by the employer on withdrawals from the simplified employee pension.

        (5) __Contributions must be made under written allocation formula__ 

        The requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to a simplified employee pension only if employer contributions to such pension are determined under a definite written allocation formula which specifies—

            (A) the requirements which an employee must satisfy to share in an allocation, and

            (B) the manner in which the amount allocated is computed.

        (6) __Employee may elect salary reduction arrangement__ 

            (A) __Arrangements which qualify__

[Pub. L. 112–95, title XI, § 1106][/us/pl/112/95/s1106], Feb. 14, 2012, [126 Stat. 152][/us/stat/126/152], provided that:

>     “(a) __General Rules.—__ 

>         “(1) __Rollover of airline payment amount.—__ 

>         If a qualified airline employee receives any airline payment amount and transfers any portion of such amount to a traditional IRA within 180 days of receipt of such amount (or, if later, within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act \[Feb. 14, 2012\]), then such amount (to the extent so transferred) shall be treated as a rollover contribution described in section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A qualified airline employee making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the amount transferred, in the taxable year in which the airline payment amount was paid to the qualified airline employee by the commercial passenger airline carrier.

>         “(2) __Transfer of amounts attributable to airline payment amount following rollover to roth ira.—__ 

>         A qualified airline employee who has contributed an airline payment amount to a Roth IRA that is treated as a qualified rollover contribution pursuant to section 125 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 \[[Pub. L. 110–458][/us/pl/110/458], [26 U.S.C. 408A][/us/usc/t26/s408A] note\], may transfer to a traditional IRA, in a trustee-to-trustee transfer, all or any part of the contribution (together with any net income allocable to such contribution), and the transfer to the traditional IRA will be deemed to have been made at the time of the rollover to the Roth IRA, if such transfer is made within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act. A qualified airline employee making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the airline payment amount previously rolled over to the Roth IRA, to the extent an amount attributable to the previous rollover was transferred to a traditional IRA, in the taxable year in which the airline payment amount was paid to the qualified airline employee by the commercial passenger airline carrier. No amount so transferred to a traditional IRA may be treated as a qualified rollover contribution with respect to a Roth IRA within the 5-taxable year period beginning with the taxable year in which such transfer was made.

>         “(3) __Extension of time to file claim for refund.—__ 

>         A qualified airline employee who excludes an amount from gross income in a prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may reflect such exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the period of limitation under section 6511(a) of such Code (or, if later, April 15, 2013).

>         “(4) __Overall limitation on amounts transferred to traditional iras.—__ 

>             “(A) __In general.—__ 

>             The aggregate amount of airline payment amounts which may be transferred to 1 or more traditional IRAs under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any qualified employee for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

>                 “(i) 90 percent of the aggregate airline payment amounts received by the qualified airline employee during the taxable year and all preceding taxable years, over

>                 “(ii) the aggregate amount of such transfers to which paragraphs (1) and (2) applied for all preceding taxable years.

>             “(B) __Special rules.—__ 

>             For purposes of applying the limitation under subparagraph (A)—

>                 “(i) any airline payment amount received by the surviving spouse of any qualified employee, and any amount transferred to a traditional IRA by such spouse under subsection (d), shall be treated as an amount received or transferred by the qualified employee, and

>                 “(ii) any amount transferred to a traditional IRA which is attributable to net income described in paragraph (2) shall not be taken into account.

>         “(5) __Covered executives not eligible to make transfers.—__ 

>         Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to any transfer by a qualified airline employee (or any transfer authorized under subsection (d) by a surviving spouse of the qualified airline employee) if at any time during the taxable year of the transfer or any preceding taxable year the qualified airline employee held a position described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 162(m)(3) \[probably means section 162(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\] with the commercial passenger airline carrier from whom the airline payment amount was received.

>     “(b) __Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for Employment Taxes.—__ 

>     For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 409][/us/usc/t42/s409]\], an airline payment amount shall not fail to be treated as a payment of wages by the commercial passenger airline carrier to the qualified airline employee in the taxable year of payment because such amount is excluded from the qualified airline employee’s gross income under subsection (a).

>     “(c) __Definitions and Special Rules.—__ 

>     For purposes of this section—

>         “(1) __Airline payment amount.—__ 

>             “(A) __In general.—__ 

>             The term ‘airline payment amount’ means any payment of any money or other property which is payable by a commercial passenger airline carrier to a qualified airline employee—

>                 “(i) under the approval of an order of a Federal bankruptcy court in a case filed after September 11, 2001, and before January 1, 2007, and

>                 “(ii) in respect of the qualified airline employee’s interest in a bankruptcy claim against the carrier, any note of the carrier (or amount paid in lieu of a note being issued), or any other fixed obligation of the carrier to pay a lump sum amount.

>                   The amount of such payment shall be determined without regard to any requirement to deduct and withhold tax from such payment under sections 3102(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and 3402(a) of such Code.

>             “(B) __Exception.—__

>         “(3) __Traditional ira.—__ 

>         The term ‘traditional IRA’ means an individual retirement plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) which is not a Roth IRA.

>         “(4) __Roth ira.—__ 

>         The term ‘Roth IRA’ has the meaning given such term by section 408A(b) of such Code.

>     “(d) __Surviving Spouse.—__ 

>     If a qualified airline employee died after receiving an airline payment amount, or if an airline payment amount was paid to the surviving spouse of a qualified airline employee in respect of the qualified airline employee, the surviving spouse of the qualified airline employee may take all actions permitted under section 125 of the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 \[[Pub. L. 110–458][/us/pl/110/458], [26 U.S.C. 408A][/us/usc/t26/s408A] note\], or under this section, to the same extent that the qualified airline employee could have done had the qualified airline employee survived.

>     “(e) __Effective Date.—__ 

>     This section shall apply to transfers made after the date of the enactment of this Act \[Feb. 14, 2012\] with respect to airline payment amounts paid before, on, or after such date.”
