    (a) __Nonrecognition of gain__ 

    In the case of the sale of any publicly traded securities with respect to which the taxpayer elects the application of this section, gain from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that the amount realized on such sale exceeds—

        (2) any portion of such cost previously taken into account under this section.

        This section shall not apply to any gain which is treated as ordinary income for purposes of this subtitle.

    (b) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __Limitation on individuals__ 

        In the case of an individual, the amount of gain which may be excluded under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of—

            (A) $50,000, or

            (B) $500,000, reduced by the amount of gain excluded under subsection (a) for all preceding taxable years.

        (2) __Limitation on C corporations__ 

        In the case of a C corporation, the amount of gain which may be excluded under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of—

            (A) $250,000, or

            (B) $1,000,000, reduced by the amount of gain excluded under subsection (a) for all preceding taxable years.

        (3) __Special rules for married individuals__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Separate returns__ 

                In the case of a separate return by a married individual, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “$25,000” for “$50,000” and “$250,000” for “$500,000”.

            (B) __Allocation of gain__ 

                In the case of any joint return, the amount of gain excluded under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be allocated equally between the spouses for purposes of applying this subsection to subsequent taxable years.

            (C) __Marital status__ 

                For purposes of this subsection, marital status shall be determined under section 7703.

        (4) __Special rules for C corporation__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) all corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 52(a)) shall be treated as 1 taxpayer, and

            (B) any gain excluded under subsection (a) by a predecessor of any C corporation shall be treated as having been excluded by such C corporation.

    (c) __Definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Publicly traded securities__ 

            The term “publicly traded securities” means securities which are traded on an established securities market.

        (2) __Purchase__ 

            The taxpayer shall be considered to have purchased any property if, but for subsection (d), the unadjusted basis of such property would be its cost within the meaning of section 1012.

        (3) __Specialized small business investment company__ 

            The term “specialized small business investment company” means any partnership or corporation which is licensed by the Small Business Administration under section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (as in effect on May 13, 1993).

        (4) __Certain entities not eligible__ 

            This section shall not apply to any estate, trust, partnership, or S corporation.

    (d) __Basis adjustments__ 

        If gain from any sale is not recognized by reason of subsection (a), such gain shall be applied to reduce (in the order acquired) the basis for determining gain or loss of any common stock or partnership interest in any specialized small business investment company which is purchased by the taxpayer during the 60-day period described in subsection (a). This subsection shall not apply for purposes of section 1202.
