## § 1374. Tax imposed on certain built-in gains

    (a) __General rule__ 

        If for any taxable year beginning in the recognition period an S corporation has a net recognized built-in gain, there is hereby imposed a tax (computed under subsection (b)) on the income of such corporation for such taxable year.

    (b) __Amount of tax__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be computed by applying the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) to the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation for the taxable year.

        (2) __Net operating loss carryforwards from C years allowed__ 

            Notwithstanding section 1371(b)(1), any net operating loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed for purposes of this section as a deduction against the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation for the taxable year. For purposes of determining the amount of any such loss which may be carried to subsequent taxable years, the amount of the net recognized built-in gain shall be treated as taxable income. Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall apply in the case of a capital loss carryforward arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation.

        (3) __Credits__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no credit shall be allowable under part IV of subchapter A of this chapter (other than under section 34) against the tax imposed by subsection (a).

            (B) __Business credit carryforwards from C years allowed__ 

                Notwithstanding section 1371(b)(1), any business credit carryforward under section 39 arising in a taxable year for which the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by subsection (a) in the same manner as if it were imposed by section 11. A similar rule shall apply in the case of the minimum tax credit under section 53 to the extent attributable to taxable years for which the corporation was a C corporation.

        (4) __Coordination with section 1201(a)__ 

        For purposes of section 1201(a)—

            (A) the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be treated as if it were imposed by section 11, and

            (B) the amount of the net recognized built-in gain shall be treated as the taxable income.

    (c) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __Corporations which were always S corporations__ 

            Subsection (a) shall not apply to any corporation if an election under section 1362(a) has been in effect with respect to such corporation for each of its taxable years. Except as provided in regulations, an S corporation and any predecessor corporation shall be treated as 1 corporation for purposes of the preceding sentence.

        (2) __Limitation on amount of recognized built-in gains__ 

        The amount of the net recognized built-in gain taken into account under this section for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the net unrealized built-in gain, over

            (B) the net recognized built-in gain for prior taxable years beginning in the recognition period.

    (d) __Definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Net unrealized built-in gain__ 

        The term “net unrealized built-in gain” means the amount (if any) by which—

            (A) the fair market value of the assets of the S corporation as of the beginning of its 1st taxable year for which an election under section 1362(a) is in effect, exceeds

            (B) the aggregate adjusted bases of such assets at such time.

        (2) __Net recognized built-in gain__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “net recognized built-in gain” means, with respect to any taxable year in the recognition period, the lesser of—

                (i) the amount which would be the taxable income of the S corporation for such taxable year if only recognized built-in gains and recognized built-in losses were taken into account, or

                (ii) such corporation’s taxable income for such taxable year (determined as provided in section 1375(b)(1)(B)).

            (B) __Carryover__ 

                If, for any taxable year described in subparagraph (A), the amount referred to in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) exceeds the amount referred to in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), such excess shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain in the succeeding taxable year. The preceding sentence shall apply only in the case of a corporation treated as an S corporation by reason of an election made on or after March 31, 1988.

        (3) __Recognized built-in gain__ 

        The term “recognized built-in gain” means any gain recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset except to the extent that the S corporation establishes that—

            (B)

             such gain exceeds the excess (if any) of—

        (5) __Treatment of certain built-in items__ 

            (A) __Income items__ 

                Any item of income which is properly taken into account during the recognition period but which is attributable to periods before the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain for the taxable year in which it is properly taken into account.

            (B) __Deduction items__ 

                Any amount which is allowable as a deduction during the recognition period (determined without regard to any carryover) but which is attributable to periods before the 1st taxable year referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be treated as a recognized built-in loss for the taxable year for which it is allowable as a deduction.

            (C) __Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain__

        If the adjusted basis of any asset is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the adjusted basis of any other asset held by the S corporation as of the beginning of the 1st taxable year referred to in paragraph (3)—

            (A) such asset shall be treated as held by the S corporation as of the beginning of such 1st taxable year, and

                The term “recognition period” means the 10-year period beginning with the 1st day of the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation.

            (B) __Special rules for 2009, 2010, and 2011__ 

            No tax shall be imposed on the net recognized built-in gain of an S corporation—

                (i) in the case of any taxable year beginning in 2009 or 2010, if the 7th taxable year in the recognition period preceded such taxable year, or

                (ii) in the case of any taxable year beginning in 2011, if the 5th year in the recognition period preceded such taxable year.

                The preceding sentence shall be applied separately with respect to any asset to which paragraph (8) applies.

            (C) __Special rule for 2012, 2013, and 2014__

                (ii) the S corporation’s basis in such asset is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such asset (or any other property) in the hands of a C corporation,

                then a tax is hereby imposed on any net recognized built-in gain attributable to any such assets for any taxable year beginning in the recognition period. The amount of such tax shall be determined under the rules of this section as modified by subparagraph (B).

            For purposes of this paragraph, the modifications of this subparagraph are as follows:

                (i) __In general__

                    Subsection (c)(1) shall not apply.
