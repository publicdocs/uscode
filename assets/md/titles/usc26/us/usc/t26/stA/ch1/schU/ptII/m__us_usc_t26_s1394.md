                    (II) such business makes bona fide efforts to be such a business.

                (iii) __Reduced requirements after testing period__ 

                    A business shall not fail to be treated as an enterprise zone business for any taxable year beginning after the testing period by reason of failing to meet any requirement of subsection (b) or (c) of section 1397C if at least 35 percent of the employees of such business for such year are residents of an empowerment zone or an enterprise community. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any business which is not a qualified business by reason of paragraph (1), (4), or (5) of section 1397C(d).

            (A) substantially all of the facility with respect to which the financing was provided ceases to be used in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, or

            (B) the principal user of such facility ceases to be an enterprise zone business (as defined in subsection (b)).
