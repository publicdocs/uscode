    (a) __Nonrecognition of gain__ 

        If an eligible person sells any property pursuant to a certificate of divestiture, at the election of the taxpayer, gain from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that the amount realized on such sale exceeds the cost (to the extent not previously taken into account under this subsection) of any permitted property purchased by the taxpayer during the 60-day period beginning on the date of such sale.

            (B) any spouse or minor or dependent child whose ownership of any property is attributable under any statute, regulation, rule, judicial canon, or executive order referred to in paragraph (2) to a person referred to in subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Certificate of divestiture__ 

        The term “certificate of divestiture” means any written determination—

            (B) that has been issued by the President or the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, in the case of executive branch officers or employees, or by the Judicial Conference of the United States (or its designee), in the case of judicial officers, and

            (C) that identifies the specific property to be divested.

        (3) __Permitted property__ 

            The term “permitted property” means any obligation of the United States or any diversified investment fund approved by regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics.

        (4) __Purchase__

        (5) __Special rule for trusts__ 

        For purposes of this section, the trustee of a trust shall be treated as an eligible person with respect to property which is held in the trust if—

            (A) any person referred to in paragraph (1)(A) has a beneficial interest in the principal or income of the trust, or

            (B) any person referred to in paragraph (1)(B) has a beneficial interest in the principal or income of the trust and such interest is attributable under any statute, regulation, rule, judicial canon, or executive order referred to in paragraph (2) to a person referred to in paragraph (1)(A).

        (6) __Judicial officer__ 

            The term “judicial officer” means the Chief Justice of the United States, the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and the judges of the United States courts of appeals, United States district courts, including the district courts in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands, Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Court of International Trade, Tax Court, Court of Federal Claims, Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and any court created by Act of Congress, the judges of which are entitled to hold office during good behavior.

    (c) __Basis adjustments__ 

        If gain from the sale of any property is not recognized by reason of subsection (a), such gain shall be applied to reduce (in the order acquired) the basis for determining gain or loss of any permitted property which is purchased by the taxpayer during the 60-day period described in subsection (a).
