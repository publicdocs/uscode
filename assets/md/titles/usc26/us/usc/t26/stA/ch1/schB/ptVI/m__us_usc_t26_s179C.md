            Any election made under this section may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified refinery property” means any portion of a qualified refinery—

            (A) the original use of which commences with the taxpayer,

            (B) which is placed in service by the taxpayer after the date of the enactment of this section and before January 1, 2014,

            (C) in the case any portion of a qualified refinery (other than a qualified refinery which is separate from any existing refinery), which meets the requirements of subsection (e),

            (D) which meets all applicable environmental laws in effect on the date such portion was placed in service,

            (E) no written binding contract for the construction of which was in effect on or before June 14, 2005, and

        (2) __Special rule for sale-leasebacks__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), if property is—

            (A) originally placed in service after the date of the enactment of this section by a person, and

            (B) sold and leased back by such person within 3 months after the date such property was originally placed in service,

            such property shall be treated as originally placed in service not earlier than the date on which such property is used under the leaseback referred to in subparagraph (B).

        (3) __Effect of waiver under Clean Air Act__ 

            A waiver under the Clean Air Act shall not be taken into account in determining whether the requirements of paragraph (1)(D) are met.

    (d) __Qualified refinery__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “qualified refinery” means any refinery located in the United States which is designed to serve the primary purpose of processing liquid fuel from crude oil or qualified fuels (as defined in section 45K(c)), or directly from shale or tar sands.

    (e) __Production capacity__ 

    The requirements of this subsection are met if the portion of the qualified refinery—

        (1) enables the existing qualified refinery to increase total volume output (determined without regard to asphalt or lube oil) by 5 percent or more on an average daily basis, or

        (2) enables the existing qualified refinery to process shale, tar sands, or qualified fuels (as defined in section 45K(c)) at a rate which is equal to or greater than 25 percent of the total throughput of such qualified refinery on an average daily basis.

    (f) __Ineligible refinery property__ 

    No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any qualified refinery property—

        (1) the primary purpose of which is for use as a topping plant, asphalt plant, lube oil facility, crude or product terminal, or blending facility, or

        (2) which is built solely to comply with consent decrees or projects mandated by Federal, State, or local governments.

            (A) a taxpayer to which subsection (a) applies is an organization to which part I of subchapter T applies, and

            (B) one or more persons directly holding an ownership interest in the taxpayer are organizations to which part I of subchapter T apply,

            the taxpayer may elect to allocate all or a portion of the deduction allowable under subsection (a) to such persons. Such allocation shall be equal to the person’s ratable share of the total amount allocated, determined on the basis of the person’s ownership interest in the taxpayer. The taxable income of the taxpayer shall not be reduced under section 1382 by reason of any amount to which the preceding sentence applies.

        (2) __Form and effect of election__ 

            An election under paragraph (1) for any taxable year shall be made on a timely filed return for such year. Such election, once made, shall be irrevocable for such taxable year.

            If any portion of the deduction available under subsection (a) is allocated to owners under paragraph (1), the cooperative shall provide any owner receiving an allocation written notice of the amount of the allocation. Such notice shall be provided before the date on which the return described in paragraph (2) is due.

    (h) __Reporting__ 

        No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) to any taxpayer for any taxable year unless such taxpayer files with the Secretary a report containing such information with respect to the operation of the refineries of the taxpayer as the Secretary shall require.
