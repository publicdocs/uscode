            (B) the amount taken into account as the amount paid for such insurance shall not exceed such charge, and

            (C) no amount shall be treated as paid for such insurance if the amount specified in the contract (or furnished to the policyholder by the insurance company in a separate statement) as the charge for such insurance is unreasonably large in relation to the total charges under the contract.
