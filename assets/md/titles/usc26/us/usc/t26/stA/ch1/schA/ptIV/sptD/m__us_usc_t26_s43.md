## § 43. Enhanced oil recovery credit

    (a) __General rule__ 

        For purposes of section 38, the enhanced oil recovery credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to 15 percent of the taxpayer’s qualified enhanced oil recovery costs for such taxable year.

    (b) __Phase-out of credit as crude oil prices increase__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

            (A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable year begins exceeds $28, bears to

            (B) $6.

        (2) __Reference price__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “reference price” means, with respect to any calendar year, the reference price determined for such calendar year under section 45K(d)(2)(C).

        (3) __Inflation adjustment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1991, there shall be substituted for the $28 amount under paragraph (1)(A) an amount equal to the product of—

                (i) $28, multiplied by

                (ii) the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year.

            (B) __Inflation adjustment factor__ 

                The term “inflation adjustment factor” means, with respect to any calendar year, a fraction the numerator of which is the GNP implicit price deflator for the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is the GNP implicit price deflator for 1990. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “GNP implicit price deflator” means the first revision of the implicit price deflator for the gross national product as computed and published by the Secretary of Commerce. Not later than April 1 of any calendar year, the Secretary shall publish the inflation adjustment factor for the preceding calendar year.

                (ii) with respect to which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable under this chapter.

            (B)

            (D)

             Any amount which is paid or incurred during the taxable year to construct a gas treatment plant which—

                (i) is located in the area of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)) lying north of 64 degrees North latitude,

                (ii) prepares Alaska natural gas for transportation through a pipeline with a capacity of at least 2,000,000,000,000 Btu of natural gas per day, and

                (iii) produces carbon dioxide which is injected into hydrocarbon-bearing geological formations.

        (2) __Qualified enhanced oil recovery project__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “qualified enhanced oil recovery project” means any project—

                (i) which involves the application (in accordance with sound engineering principles) of 1 or more tertiary recovery methods (as defined in section 193(b)(3)) which can reasonably be expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil which will ultimately be recovered,

                (ii) which is located within the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), and

                (iii) with respect to which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter commences after December 31, 1990.

            (B) __Certification__

        (3) __At-risk limitation__ 

            For purposes of determining qualified enhanced oil recovery costs, rules similar to the rules of section 49(a)(1), section 49(a)(2), and section 49(b) shall apply.

        (4) __Special rule for certain gas displacement projects__ 

            For purposes of this section, immiscible non-hydrocarbon gas displacement shall be treated as a tertiary recovery method under section 193(b)(3).

        (5) __Alaska natural gas__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)(D)—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “Alaska natural gas” means natural gas entering the Alaska natural gas pipeline (as defined in section 168(i)(16) (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof)) which is produced from a well—

    (d) __Other rules__ 

        (1) __Disallowance of deduction__
