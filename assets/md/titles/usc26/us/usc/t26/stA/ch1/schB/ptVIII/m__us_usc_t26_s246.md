            The deductions allowed by sections 243, 244, and 245 shall not apply to any dividend from a corporation which, for the taxable year of the corporation in which the distribution is made, or for the next preceding taxable year of the corporation, is a corporation exempt from tax under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc., organizations) or section 521 (relating to farmers’ cooperative associations).

        (2) __Subsection not to apply to certain dividends of Federal Home Loan Banks__ 

            (A) __Dividends out of current earnings and profits__ 

            In the case of any dividend paid by any FHLB out of earnings and profits of the FHLB for the taxable year in which such dividend was paid, paragraph (1) shall not apply to that portion of such dividend which bears the same ratio to the total dividend as—

                (i) the dividends received by the FHLB from the FHLMC during such taxable year, bears to

                (ii) the total earnings and profits of the FHLB for such taxable year.

            (B) __Dividends out of accumulated earnings and profits__

                For purposes of clause (ii), the accumulated earnings and profits of the FHLB as of January 1, 1985, shall be treated as equal to its retained earnings as of such date.

            (C) __Coordination with section 243__ 

                To the extent that paragraph (1) does not apply to any dividend by reason of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, the requirement contained in section 243(a) that the corporation paying the dividend be subject to taxation under this chapter shall not apply.

                    (I) any dividends received by the FHLB from the FHLMC during such taxable year, and

                    (II) the total earnings and profits (determined without regard to dividends described in subclause (I)) of the FHLB as reported in its annual financial statement prepared in accordance with section 20 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act ([12 U.S.C. 1440][/us/usc/t12/s1440]).

    (b) __Limitation on aggregate amount of deductions__

    (c) __Exclusion of certain dividends__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        No deduction shall be allowed under section 243, 244, or 245, in respect of any dividend on any share of stock—

            (A) which is held by the taxpayer for 45 days or less during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend, or

            (B) to the extent that the taxpayer is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.

        (2) __90-day rule in the case of certain preference dividends__ 

        In the case of stock having preference in dividends, if the taxpayer receives dividends with respect to such stock which are attributable to a period or periods aggregating in excess of 366 days, paragraph (1)(A) shall be applied—

    (d) __Dividends from a DISC or former DISC__ 

        No deduction shall be allowed under section 243 in respect of a dividend from a corporation which is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) to the extent such dividend is paid out of the corporation’s accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income, or is a deemed distribution pursuant to section 995(b)(1).
