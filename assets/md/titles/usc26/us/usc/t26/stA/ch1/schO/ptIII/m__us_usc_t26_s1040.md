## § 1040. Transfer of certain farm, etc., real property

    (a) __General rule__ 

        If the executor of the estate of any decedent transfers to a qualified heir (within the meaning of section 2032A(e)(1)) any property with respect to which an election was made under section 2032A, then gain on such transfer shall be recognized to the estate only to the extent that, on the date of such transfer, the fair market value of such property exceeds the value of such property for purposes of chapter 11 (determined without regard to section 2032A).

    (b) __Similar rule for certain trusts__ 

        To the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a rule similar to the rule provided in subsection (a) shall apply where the trustee of a trust (any portion of which is included in the gross estate of the decedent) transfers property with respect to which an election was made under section 2032A.

    (c) __Basis of property acquired in transfer described in subsection (a) or (b)__ 

        The basis of property acquired in a transfer with respect to which gain realized is not recognized by reason of subsection (a) or (b) shall be the basis of such property immediately before the transfer increased by the amount of the gain recognized to the estate or trust on the transfer.

    “(c) Basis of property acquired in transfer described in subsection (a) or (b).—The basis of property acquired in a transfer with respect to which gain realized is not recognized by reason of subsection (a) or (b) shall be the basis of such property immediately before the transfer increased by the amount of the gain recognized to the estate or trust on the transfer.”

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 97–34][/us/pl/97/34] substituted “shall apply where the trustee of a trust (any portion of which is included in the gross estate of the decedent) transfers property with respect to which an election was made under section 2032A” for “shall apply where—

    “(1) by reason of the death of the decedent, a qualified heir has a right to receive from a trust a specific dollar amount which is the equivalent of a pecuniary bequest, and

    “(2) the trustee of the trust satisfies such right with property with respect to which an election was made under section 2032A”.

    1980—[Pub.
