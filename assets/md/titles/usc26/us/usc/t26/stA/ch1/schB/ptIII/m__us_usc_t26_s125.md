 __Exception for Certain Cafeteria Plans and Benefits__ 

[Pub. L. 98–369, div. A, title V, § 531(b)(5)][/us/pl/98/369/s531/b/5], July 18, 1984, [98 Stat. 883][/us/stat/98/883], as amended by [Pub. L. 99–514, title XVIII, § 1853(b)(2)][/us/pl/99/514/s1853/b/2], (3), Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2870][/us/stat/100/2870], 2871, provided that:

>     “(A) __General transitional rule.—__ 

>     Any cafeteria plan in existence on February 10, 1984, which failed as of such date and continued to fail thereafter to satisfy the rules relating to section 125 under proposed Treasury regulations, and any benefit offered under such a cafeteria plan which failed as of such date and continued to fail thereafter to satisfy the rules of section 105, 106, 120, or 129 under proposed Treasury regulations, will not fail to be a cafeteria plan under section 125 or a nontaxable benefit under section 105, 106, 120, or 129 solely because of such failures. The preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to cafeteria plans and benefits provided under cafeteria plans before the earlier of—

>         “(i) January 1, 1985, or

>         “(ii) the effective date of any modification to provide additional benefits after February 10, 1984.

>     “(B) __Special transition rule for advance election benefit banks.—__ 

>     Any benefit offered under a cafeteria plan in existence on February 10, 1984, which failed as of such date and continued to fail thereafter to satisfy the rules of section 105, 106, 120, or 129 under proposed Treasury regulations because an employee was assured of receiving (in cash or any other benefit) amounts available but unused for covered reimbursement during the year without regard to whether he incurred covered expenses, will not fail to be a nontaxable benefit under such applicable section solely because of such failure. The preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to benefits provided under cafeteria plans before the earlier of—

>         “(i) July 1, 1985, or

>         “(ii) the effective date of any modification to provide additional benefits after February 10, 1984.

>         Except as provided in Treasury regulations, the special transition rule is available only for benefits with respect to which, after December 31, 1984, contributions are fixed before the period of coverage and taxable cash is not available until the end of such period of coverage.

>     “(C) __Plans for which substantial implementation costs were incurred.—__ 

>     For purposes of this paragraph, any plan with respect to which substantial implementation costs had been incurred before February 10, 1984, shall be treated as in existence on February 10, 1984.

>     “(D) __Collective bargaining agreements.—__ 

>     In the case of any cafeteria plan in existence on February 10, 1984, and maintained pursuant to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and 1 or more employers, the date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreements terminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof agreed to after July 18, 1984) shall be substituted for ‘January 1, 1985’ in subparagraph (A) and for ‘July 1, 1985’ in subparagraph (B). For purposes of the preceding sentence, any plan amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan which amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement added by this section (or any requirement in the regulations under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 \[now 1986\] proposed on May 6, 1984) shall not be treated as a termination of such collective bargaining agreement.

>     “(E) __Special rule where contributions or reimbursements suspended.—__ 

>     For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), a plan shall not be treated as not continuing to fail to satisfy the rules referred to in such subparagraphs with respect to any benefit provided in the form of a flexible spending arrangement merely because contributions or reimbursements (or both) with respect to such plan were suspended before January 1, 1985.”
