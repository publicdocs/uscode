## § 151. Allowance of deductions for personal exemptions

    (a) __Allowance of deductions__ 

        In the case of an individual, the exemptions provided by this section shall be allowed as deductions in computing taxable income.

    (b) __Taxpayer and spouse__ 

        An exemption of the exemption amount for the taxpayer; and an additional exemption of the exemption amount for the spouse of the taxpayer if a joint return is not made by the taxpayer and his spouse, and if the spouse, for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins, has no gross income and is not the dependent of another taxpayer.

    (c) __Additional exemption for dependents__ 

        An exemption of the exemption amount for each individual who is a dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer for the taxable year.

    (d) __Exemption amount__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term “exemption amount” means $2,000.

        (2) __Exemption amount disallowed in case of certain dependents__ 

            In the case of an individual with respect to whom a deduction under this section is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual’s taxable year begins, the exemption amount applicable to such individual for such individual’s taxable year shall be zero.

        (3) __Phaseout__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of any taxpayer whose adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds the applicable amount in effect under section 68(b), the exemption amount shall be reduced by the applicable percentage.

            (B) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percentage” means 2 percentage points for each $2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds the applicable amount in effect under section 68(b). In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “$1,250” for “$2,500”. In no event shall the applicable percentage exceed 100 percent.

            (C) __Coordination with other provisions__ 

                The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply for purposes of determining whether a deduction under this section with respect to any individual is allowable to another taxpayer for any taxable year.

        (4) __Inflation adjustment__ 

        In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1989, the dollar amount contained in paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, by substituting “calendar year 1988” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

    (e) __Identifying information required__ 

        No exemption shall be allowed under this section with respect to any individual unless the TIN of such individual is included on the return claiming the exemption.
