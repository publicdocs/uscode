## § 643. Definitions applicable to subparts A, B, C, and D

    (a) __Distributable net income__ 

    For purposes of this part, the term “distributable net income” means, with respect to any taxable year, the taxable income of the estate or trust computed with the following modifications—

        (1) __Deduction for distributions__ 

            No deduction shall be taken under sections 651 and 661 (relating to additional deductions).

        (2) __Deduction for personal exemption__ 

            No deduction shall be taken under section 642(b) (relating to deduction for personal exemptions).

        (3) __Capital gains and losses__ 

            Gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be excluded to the extent that such gains are allocated to corpus and are not (A) paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the taxable year, or (B) paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for the purposes specified in section 642(c). Losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be excluded, except to the extent such losses are taken into account in determining the amount of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets which are paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the taxable year. The exclusion under section 1202 shall not be taken into account.

        (4) __Extraordinary dividends and taxable stock dividends__ 

            For purposes only of subpart B (relating to trusts which distribute current income only), there shall be excluded those items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, does not pay or credit to any beneficiary by reason of his determination that such dividends are allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law.

        (5) __Tax-exempt interest__ 

            There shall be included any tax-exempt interest to which section 103 applies, reduced by any amounts which would be deductible in respect of disbursements allocable to such interest but for the provisions of section 265 (relating to disallowance of certain deductions).

        (6) __Income of foreign trust__ 

        In the case of a foreign trust—

            (A) There shall be included the amounts of gross income from sources without the United States, reduced by any amounts which would be deductible in respect of disbursements allocable to such income but for the provisions of section 265(a)(1) (relating to disallowance of certain deductions).

            (B) Gross income from sources within the United States shall be determined without regard to section 894 (relating to income exempt under treaty).

            (C) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to a foreign trust. In the case of such a trust, there shall be included gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets, reduced by losses from such sales or exchanges to the extent such losses do not exceed gains from such sales or exchanges.

        (7) __Abusive transactions__ 

            The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part, including regulations to prevent avoidance of such purposes.

        If the estate or trust is allowed a deduction under section 642(c), the amount of the modifications specified in paragraphs (5) and (6) shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of income which is paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for the purposes specified in section 642(c) is deemed to consist of items specified in those paragraphs. For this purpose, such amount shall (in the absence of specific provisions in the governing instrument) be deemed to consist of the same proportion of each class of items of income of the estate or trust as the total of each class bears to the total of all classes.

    (b) __Income__ 

        For purposes of this subpart and subparts B, C, and D, the term “income”, when not preceded by the words “taxable”, “distributable net”, “undistributed net”, or “gross”, means the amount of income of the estate or trust for the taxable year determined under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law. Items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, determines to be allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law shall not be considered income.

        (1) by allocating between the estate or trust and its beneficiaries any credit allowable under section 31(c) (on the basis of their respective shares of any such payment taken into account under this subchapter),

        (2) by treating each beneficiary to whom such credit is allocated as if an amount equal to such credit has been paid to him by the estate or trust, and

        (3) by allowing the estate or trust a deduction in an amount equal to the credit so allocated to beneficiaries.

    (e) __Treatment of property distributed in kind__ 

        (1) __Basis of beneficiary__ 

        The basis of any property received by a beneficiary in a distribution from an estate or trust shall be—

            (B) any gain or loss recognized to the estate or trust on the distribution.

        (2) __Amount of distribution__ 

        In the case of any distribution of property (other than cash), the amount taken into account under sections 661(a)(2) and 662(a)(2) shall be the lesser of—

            (B) __Election__ 

                Any election under this paragraph shall apply to all distributions made by the estate or trust during a taxable year and shall be made on the return of such estate or trust for such taxable year.

            Any such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

        (4) __Exception for distributions described in section 663(a)__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to any distribution described in section 663(a).

    (f) __Treatment of multiple trusts__ 

    For purposes of this subchapter, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, 2 or more trusts shall be treated as 1 trust if—

            An election under paragraph (1) shall be made on or before the 65th day after the close of the taxable year of the trust and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe.

        In the case of a taxable year reasonably expected to be the last taxable year of an estate—

            (A) any reference in this subsection to a trust shall be treated as including a reference to an estate, and

            (B) the fiduciary of the estate shall be treated as the trustee.

    (h) __Distributions by certain foreign trusts through nominees__ 

        For purposes of this part, any amount paid to a United States person which is derived directly or indirectly from a foreign trust of which the payor is not the grantor shall be deemed in the year of payment to have been directly paid by the foreign trust to such United States person.

    (i) __Loans from foreign trusts__ 

    For purposes of subparts B, C, and D—

        (1) __General rule__

            (B) any United States person not described in subparagraph (A) who is related to such grantor or beneficiary,

            (B) __Related person__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A person is related to another person if the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b). In applying section 267 for purposes of the preceding sentence, section 267(c)(4) shall be applied as if the family of an individual includes the spouses of the members of the family.
