## § 446. General rule for methods of accounting

    (a) __General rule__ 

        Taxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.

    (b) __Exceptions__ 

        If no method of accounting has been regularly used by the taxpayer, or if the method used does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income.

    (c) __Permissible methods__ 

    Subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), a taxpayer may compute taxable income under any of the following methods of accounting—

        (1) the cash receipts and disbursements method;

        (2) an accrual method;

        (3) any other method permitted by this chapter; or

        (4) any combination of the foregoing methods permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    (d) __Taxpayer engaged in more than one business__ 

        A taxpayer engaged in more than one trade or business may, in computing taxable income, use a different method of accounting for each trade or business.

    (e) __Requirement respecting change of accounting method__ 

        Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, a taxpayer who changes the method of accounting on the basis of which he regularly computes his income in keeping his books shall, before computing his taxable income under the new method, secure the consent of the Secretary.

    (f) __Failure to request change of method of accounting__ 

    If the taxpayer does not file with the Secretary a request to change the method of accounting, the absence of the consent of the Secretary to a change in the method of accounting shall not be taken into account—

        (1) to prevent the imposition of any penalty, or the addition of any amount to tax, under this title, or

        (2) to diminish the amount of such penalty or addition to tax.
