    (m) __Nonrecognition of gain or loss on contribution of employer securities to tax credit employee stock ownership plan__ 

        No gain or loss shall be recognized to the taxpayer with respect to the transfer of employer securities to a tax credit employee stock ownership plan maintained by the taxpayer to the extent that such transfer is required under section 41(c)(1)(B),1 or subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 48(n)(1).1
