                (iii) __Property must be depreciable__ 

                    No amount shall be allowable as a deduction by reason of this subparagraph with respect to any property for any taxable year unless a depreciation deduction would be allowable with respect to such property for such taxable year.

                (iv) __Amount treated as depreciation deduction__ 

                    For purposes of this subtitle, any amount allowable as a deduction by reason of this subparagraph shall be treated as a depreciation deduction allowable under section 168.

        (2) __Coordination with reductions in amount allowable by reason of personal use, etc.__ 

        This subsection shall be applied before—

            (A) the application of subsection (b), and

            (B) the application of any other reduction in the amount of any depreciation deduction allowable under section 168 by reason of any use not qualifying the property for such credit or depreciation deduction.

    (b) __Limitation where business use of listed property not greater than 50 percent__ 

        (1) __Depreciation__ 

            If any listed property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use for any taxable year, the deduction allowed under section 168 with respect to such property for such taxable year and any subsequent taxable year shall be determined under section 168(g) (relating to alternative depreciation system).

        (2) __Recapture__ 

            (A) __Where business use percentage does not exceed 50 percent__

                (i) property is predominantly used in a qualified business use in a taxable year in which it is placed in service, and

                (ii) such property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use for any subsequent taxable year,

                then any excess depreciation shall be included in gross income for the taxable year referred to in clause (ii), and the depreciation deduction for the taxable year referred to in clause (ii) and any subsequent taxable years shall be determined under section 168(g) (relating to alternative depreciation system).

            (B) __Excess depreciation__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “excess depreciation” means the excess (if any) of—

                (i) the amount of the depreciation deductions allowable with respect to the property for taxable years before the 1st taxable year in which the property was not predominantly used in a qualified business use, over

                (ii) the amount which would have been so allowable if the property had not been predominantly used in a qualified business use for the taxable year in which it was placed in service.

        (3) __Property predominantly used in qualified business use__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, property shall be treated as predominantly used in a qualified business use for any taxable year if the business use percentage for such taxable year exceeds 50 percent.

    (c) __Treatment of leases__ 

        (1) __Lessor’s deductions not affected__ 

            This section shall not apply to any listed property leased or held for leasing by any person regularly engaged in the business of leasing such property.

        (2) __Lessee’s deductions reduced__ 

            For purposes of determining the amount allowable as a deduction under this chapter for rentals or other payments under a lease for a period of 30 days or more of listed property, only the allowable percentage of such payments shall be taken into account.

        (3) __Allowable percentage__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (2), the allowable percentage shall be determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary.
