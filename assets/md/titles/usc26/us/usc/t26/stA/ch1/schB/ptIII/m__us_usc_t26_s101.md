## § 101. Certain death benefits

    (a) __Proceeds of life insurance contracts payable by reason of death__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), subsection (d), subsection (f), and subsection (j), gross income does not include amounts received (whether in a single sum or otherwise) under a life insurance contract, if such amounts are paid by reason of the death of the insured.

        (2) __Transfer for valuable consideration__ 

        In the case of a transfer for a valuable consideration, by assignment or otherwise, of a life insurance contract or any interest therein, the amount excluded from gross income by paragraph (1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the actual value of such consideration and the premiums and other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee. The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of such a transfer—

            (A) if such contract or interest therein has a basis for determining gain or loss in the hands of a transferee determined in whole or in part by reference to such basis of such contract or interest therein in the hands of the transferor, or

            (B) if such transfer is to the insured, to a partner of the insured, to a partnership in which the insured is a partner, or to a corporation in which the insured is a shareholder or officer.

            The term “other amounts” in the first sentence of this paragraph includes interest paid or accrued by the transferee on indebtedness with respect to such contract or any interest therein if such interest paid or accrued is not allowable as a deduction by reason of section 264(a)(4).

    (d) __Payment of life insurance proceeds at a date later than death__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            The amounts held by an insurer with respect to any beneficiary shall be prorated (in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary) over the period or periods with respect to which such payments are to be made. There shall be excluded from the gross income of such beneficiary in the taxable year received any amount determined by such proration. Gross income includes, to the extent not excluded by the preceding sentence, amounts received under agreements to which this subsection applies.

        (2) __Amount held by an insurer__ 

        An amount held by an insurer with respect to any beneficiary shall mean an amount to which subsection (a) applies which is—

            (A) held by any insurer under an agreement provided for in the life insurance contract, whether as an option or otherwise, to pay such amount on a date or dates later than the death of the insured, and

            (B)

             equal to the value of such agreement to such beneficiary

                (i) as of the date of death of the insured (as if any option exercised under the life insurance contract were exercised at such time), and

                (ii) as discounted on the basis of the interest rate used by the insurer in calculating payments under the agreement and mortality tables prescribed by the Secretary.

        (3) __Application of subsection__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to any amount to which subsection (c) is applicable.

        (1) __In general__ 

        Any amount paid by reason of the death of the insured under a flexible premium life insurance contract issued before January 1, 1985 shall be excluded from gross income only if—

                (i) the sum of the premiums paid under such contract does not at any time exceed the guideline premium limitation as of such time, and

                (ii) any amount payable by reason of the death of the insured (determined without regard to any qualified additional benefit) is not at any time less than the applicable percentage of the cash value of such contract at such time, or

            (B) by the terms of such contract, the cash value of such contract may not at any time exceed the net single premium with respect to the amount payable by reason of the death of the insured (determined without regard to any qualified additional benefit) at such time.

        (2) __Guideline premium limitation__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Guideline premium limitation__ 

            The term “guideline premium limitation” means, as of any date, the greater of—

                (ii) the sum of the guideline level premiums to such date.

            (B) __Guideline single premium__ 

            The term “guideline single premium” means the premium at issue with respect to future benefits under the contract (without regard to any qualified additional benefit), and with respect to any charges for qualified additional benefits, at the time of a determination under subparagraph (A) or (E) and which is based on—

                (ii) interest at the greater of an annual effective rate of 6 percent or the minimum rate or rates guaranteed upon issue of the contract.

            (C) __Guideline level premium__ 

                The term “guideline level premium” means the level annual amount, payable over the longest period permitted under the contract (but ending not less than 20 years from date of issue or not later than age 95, if earlier), computed on the same basis as the guideline single premium, except that subparagraph (B)(ii) shall be applied by substituting “4 percent” for “6 percent”.

            (D) __Computational rules__ 

            In computing the guideline single premium or guideline level premium under subparagraph (B) or (C)—

                (i) the excess of the amount payable by reason of the death of the insured (determined without regard to any qualified additional benefit) over the cash value of the contract shall be deemed to be not greater than such excess at the time the contract was issued,

                (ii) the maturity date shall be the latest maturity date permitted under the contract, but not less than 20 years after the date of issue or (if earlier) age 95, and

                (i) the amount so returned (excluding interest) shall be deemed to reduce the sum of the premiums paid under the contract during such year, and

                (iii) family term coverage, or

                (iv) waiver of premium.

            (F) __Premium payments not disqualifying contract__ 

                The payment of a premium which would result in the sum of the premiums paid exceeding the guideline premium limitation shall be disregarded for purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(i) if the amount of such premium does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent the termination of the contract without cash value on or before the end of the contract year.

            (G) __Net single premium__ 

            In computing the net single premium under paragraph (1)(B)—

                (i) the mortality basis shall be that guaranteed under the contract (determined by reference to the most recent mortality table allowed under all State laws on the date of issuance),

                (ii)

                 interest shall be based on the greater of—

                    (I) an annual effective rate of 4 percent (3 percent for contracts issued before July 1, 1983), or

                    (II) the minimum rate or rates guaranteed upon issue of the contract, and

                (iii) the computational rules of paragraph (2)(D) shall apply, except that the maturity date referred to in clause (ii) thereof shall not be earlier than age 95.

                (ii) reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the error,

                the Secretary may waive the failure to satisfy such requirements.
