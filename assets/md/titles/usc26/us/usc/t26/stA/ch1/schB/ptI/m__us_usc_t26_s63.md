            (A)

             200 percent of the dollar amount in effect under subparagraph (C) for the taxable year in the case of—

                (i) a joint return, or

                (ii) a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)),

            (B) $4,400 in the case of a head of household (as defined in section 2(b)), or

        (3) __Additional standard deduction for aged and blind__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the additional standard deduction is the sum of each additional amount to which the taxpayer is entitled under subsection (f).

        (4) __Adjustments for inflation__ 

        In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1988, each dollar amount contained in paragraph (2)(B), (2)(C), or (5) or subsection (f) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

        (2) the deduction for personal exemptions provided by section 151.

    (e) __Election to itemize__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Unless an individual makes an election under this subsection for the taxable year, no itemized deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year. For purposes of this subtitle, the determination of whether a deduction is allowable under this chapter shall be made without regard to the preceding sentence.

        (2) __Time and manner of election__ 

            Any election under this subsection shall be made on the taxpayer’s return, and the Secretary shall prescribe the manner of signifying such election on the return.

        (3) __Change of election__ 

        Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a change of election with respect to itemized deductions for any taxable year may be made after the filing of the return for such year. If the spouse of the taxpayer filed a separate return for any taxable year corresponding to the taxable year of the taxpayer, the change shall not be allowed unless, in accordance with such regulations—

            (A) the spouse makes a change of election with respect to itemized deductions, for the taxable year covered in such separate return, consistent with the change of treatment sought by the taxpayer, and

            (B) the taxpayer and his spouse consent in writing to the assessment (within such period as may be agreed on with the Secretary) of any deficiency, to the extent attributable to such change of election, even though at the time of the filing of such consent the assessment of such deficiency would otherwise be prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.

            This paragraph shall not apply if the tax liability of the taxpayer’s spouse for the taxable year corresponding to the taxable year of the taxpayer has been compromised under section 7122.

    (f) __Aged or blind additional amounts__ 

        (1) __Additional amounts for the aged__ 

        The taxpayer shall be entitled to an additional amount of $600—

            (A) for himself if he has attained age 65 before the close of his taxable year, and

            (B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b).

        (2) __Additional amount for blind__ 

        The taxpayer shall be entitled to an additional amount of $600—

            (A) for himself if he is blind at the close of the taxable year, and

            (B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse is blind as of the close of the taxable year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b).

            For purposes of subparagraph (B), if the spouse dies during the taxable year the determination of whether such spouse is blind shall be made as of the time of such death.

        (3) __Higher amount for certain unmarried individuals__ 

            In the case of an individual who is not married and is not a surviving spouse, paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be applied by substituting “$750” for “$600”.

        (4) __Blindness defined__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, an individual is blind only if his central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with correcting lenses, or if his visual acuity is greater than 20/200 but is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.
