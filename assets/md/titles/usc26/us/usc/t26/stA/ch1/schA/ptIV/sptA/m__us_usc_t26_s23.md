## § 23. Adoption expenses

    (a) __Allowance of credit__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter the amount of the qualified adoption expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer.

        (2) __Year credit allowed__ 

        The credit under paragraph (1) with respect to any expense shall be allowed—

            (A) in the case of any expense paid or incurred before the taxable year in which such adoption becomes final, for the taxable year following the taxable year during which such expense is paid or incurred, and

            (B) in the case of an expense paid or incurred during or after the taxable year in which such adoption becomes final, for the taxable year in which such expense is paid or incurred.

        (3) __$10,000 credit for adoption of child with special needs regardless of expenses__ 

            In the case of an adoption of a child with special needs which becomes final during a taxable year, the taxpayer shall be treated as having paid during such year qualified adoption expenses with respect to such adoption in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of $10,000 over the aggregate qualified adoption expenses actually paid or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to such adoption during such taxable year and all prior taxable years.

    (b) __Limitations__ 

        (1) __Dollar limitation__ 

            The aggregate amount of qualified adoption expenses which may be taken into account under subsection (a) for all taxable years with respect to the adoption of a child by the taxpayer shall not exceed $10,000.

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) for any taxable year (determined without regard to subsection (c)) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount so allowable (determined without regard to this paragraph but with regard to paragraph (1)) as—

                (i) the amount (if any) by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000, bears to

                (ii) $40,000.

            (B) __Determination of adjusted gross income__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), adjusted gross income shall be determined without regard to sections 911, 931, and 933.

        (2) __Limitation__

            (B) such State has determined that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance, and

            (C) such child is a citizen or resident of the United States (as defined in section 217(h)(3)).

    (e) __Special rules for foreign adoptions__

    (h) __Adjustments for inflation__ 

    In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, each of the dollar amounts in subsection (a)(3) and paragraphs (1) and (2)(A)(i) of subsection (b) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

        (1) such dollar amount, multiplied by
