    (3)

     by making proper adjustments (as prescribed by the Secretary) for transfers of property between qualified business units of the taxpayer having different functional currencies, including—

        (A) treating post-1986 remittances from each such unit as made on a pro rata basis out of post-1986 accumulated earnings, and
