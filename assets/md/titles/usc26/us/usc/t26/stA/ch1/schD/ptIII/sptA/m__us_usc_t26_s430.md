## § 430. Minimum funding standards for single-employer defined benefit pension plans

    (a) __Minimum required contribution__ 

    For purposes of this section and section 412(a)(2)(A), except as provided in subsection (f), the term “minimum required contribution” means, with respect to any plan year of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan—

        (1)

         in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) is less than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the sum of—

            (A) the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year,

            (B) the shortfall amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year determined under subsection (c), and

            (C) the waiver amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year as determined under subsection (e);

        (2) in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) equals or exceeds the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year reduced (but not below zero) by such excess.

    (b) __Target normal cost__ 

    For purposes of this section:

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (i)(2) with respect to plans in at-risk status, the term “target normal cost” means, for any plan year, the excess of—

            (A)

             the sum of—

                (i) the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year, plus

                (ii) the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year, over

            (B) the amount of mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year.

        (2) __Special rule for increase in compensation__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, if any benefit attributable to services performed in a preceding plan year is increased by reason of any increase in compensation during the current plan year, the increase in such benefit shall be treated as having accrued during the current plan year.

    (c) __Shortfall amortization charge__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization charge for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total (not less than zero) of the shortfall amortization installments for such plan year with respect to any shortfall amortization base which has not been fully amortized under this subsection.

        (2) __Shortfall amortization installment__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)—

            (A) __Determination__ 

                The shortfall amortization installments are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level annual installments over the 7-plan-year period beginning with such plan year.

            (B) __Shortfall installment__ 

                The shortfall amortization installment for any plan year in the 7-plan-year period under subparagraph (A) with respect to any shortfall amortization base is the annual installment determined under subparagraph (A) for that year for that base.

            (C) __Segment rates__ 

                In determining any shortfall amortization installment under this paragraph, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).

            (D) __Special election for eligible plan years__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If a plan sponsor elects to apply this subparagraph with respect to the shortfall amortization base of a plan for any eligible plan year (in this subparagraph and paragraph (7) referred to as an “election year”), then, notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B)—

                    (I) the shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall be determined under clause (ii) or (iii), whichever is specified in the election, and

                    (II) the shortfall amortization installment for any plan year in the 9-plan-year period described in clause (ii) or the 15-plan-year period described in clause (iii), respectively, with respect to such shortfall amortization base is the annual installment determined under the applicable clause for that year for that base.

                (ii) __2 plus 7 amortization schedule__ 

                The shortfall amortization installments determined under this clause are—

                    (I) in the case of the first 2 plan years in the 9-plan-year period beginning with the election year, interest on the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year (determined using the effective interest rate for the plan for the election year), and

                    (II) in the case of the last 7 plan years in such 9-plan-year period, the amounts necessary to amortize the remaining balance of the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year in level annual installments over such last 7 plan years (using the segment rates under subparagraph (C) for the election year).

                (iii) __15-year amortization__ 

                    The shortfall amortization installments determined under this subparagraph are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for the election year in level annual installments over the 15-plan-year period beginning with the election year (using the segment rates under subparagraph (C) for the election year).

                (iv) __Election__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The plan sponsor of a plan may elect to have this subparagraph apply to not more than 2 eligible plan years with respect to the plan, except that in the case of a plan described in section 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the plan sponsor may only elect to have this subparagraph apply to a plan year beginning in 2011.

                    (II) __Amortization schedule__ 

                        Such election shall specify whether the amortization schedule under clause (ii) or (iii) shall apply to an election year, except that if a plan sponsor elects to have this subparagraph apply to 2 eligible plan years, the plan sponsor must elect the same schedule for both years.

                    (III) __Other rules__ 

                        Such election shall be made at such time, and in such form and manner, as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary. The Secretary shall, before granting a revocation request, provide the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation an opportunity to comment on the conditions applicable to the treatment of any portion of the election year shortfall amortization base that remains unamortized as of the revocation date.

                (v) __Eligible plan year__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “eligible plan year” means any plan year beginning in 2008, 2009, 2010, or 2011, except that a plan year shall only be treated as an eligible plan year if the due date under subsection (j)(1) for the payment of the minimum required contribution for such plan year occurs on or after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph.

                (vi) __Reporting__ 

                A plan sponsor of a plan who makes an election under clause (i) shall—

                    (I) give notice of the election to participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and

                    (II) inform the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of such election in such form and manner as the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may prescribe.

                (vii) __Increases in required installments in certain cases__ 

                    For increases in required contributions in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions, see paragraph (7).

        (3) __Shortfall amortization base__ 

        For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization base of a plan for a plan year is—

            (A) the funding shortfall of such plan for such plan year, minus

            (B) the present value (determined using the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2)) of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments which have been determined for such plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases of the plan for any plan year preceding such plan year.

        (4) __Funding shortfall__ 

        For purposes of this section, the funding shortfall of a plan for any plan year is the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the funding target of the plan for the plan year, over

            (B) the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) for the plan year which are held by the plan on the valuation date.

        (5) __Exemption from new shortfall amortization base__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(A)) is equal to or greater than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization base of the plan for such plan year shall be zero.

            (B) __Transition rule__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (iii), in the case of plan years beginning after 2007 and before 2011, only the applicable percentage of the funding target shall be taken into account under paragraph (3)(A) in determining the funding shortfall for purposes of paragraph (3)(A) and subparagraph (A).

                (ii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                    For purposes of subparagraph (A), the applicable percentage shall be determined in accordance with the following table:

<table>

                    </table>

                (iii) __Transition relief not available for new or deficit reduction plans__ 

                Clause (i) shall not apply to a plan—

                    (I) which was not in effect for a plan year beginning in 2007, or

                    (II) which was in effect for a plan year beginning in 2007 and which was subject to section 412(l) (as in effect for plan years beginning in 2007) for such year, determined after the application of paragraphs (6) and (9) thereof.

        (6) __Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target__ 

            In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the shortfall amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the shortfall amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all shortfall amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.

        (7) __Increases in alternate required installments in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If there is an installment acceleration amount with respect to a plan for any plan year in the restriction period with respect to an election year under paragraph (2)(D), then the shortfall amortization installment otherwise determined and payable under such paragraph for such plan year shall, subject to the limitation under subparagraph (B), be increased by such amount.

            (B) __Total installments limited to shortfall base__ 

            Subject to rules prescribed by the Secretary, if a shortfall amortization installment with respect to any shortfall amortization base for an election year is required to be increased for any plan year under subparagraph (A)—

                (i) such increase shall not result in the amount of such installment exceeding the present value of such installment and all succeeding installments with respect to such base (determined without regard to such increase but after application of clause (ii)), and

                (ii) subsequent shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall, in reverse order of the otherwise required installments, be reduced to the extent necessary to limit the present value of such subsequent shortfall amortization installments (after application of this paragraph) to the present value of the remaining unamortized shortfall amortization base.

            (C) __Installment acceleration amount__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __In general__ 

                The term “installment acceleration amount” means, with respect to any plan year in a restriction period with respect to an election year, the sum of—

                    (I) the aggregate amount of excess employee compensation determined under subparagraph (D) with respect to all employees for the plan year, plus

                    (II) the aggregate amount of extraordinary dividends and redemptions determined under subparagraph (E) for the plan year.

                (ii) __Annual limitation__ 

                The installment acceleration amount for any plan year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

                    (I) the sum of the shortfall amortization installments for the plan year and all preceding plan years in the amortization period elected under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to the shortfall amortization base with respect to an election year, determined without regard to paragraph (2)(D) and this paragraph, over

                    (II) the sum of the shortfall amortization installments for such plan year and all such preceding plan years, determined after application of paragraph (2)(D) (and in the case of any preceding plan year, after application of this paragraph).

                (iii) __Carryover of excess installment acceleration amounts__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        If the installment acceleration amount for any plan year (determined without regard to clause (ii)) exceeds the limitation under clause (ii), then, subject to subclause (II), such excess shall be treated as an installment acceleration amount with respect to the succeeding plan year.

                    (II) __Cap to apply__ 

                        If any amount treated as an installment acceleration amount under subclause (I) or this subclause with respect any succeeding plan year, when added to other installment acceleration amounts (determined without regard to clause (ii)) with respect to the plan year, exceeds the limitation under clause (ii), the portion of such amount representing such excess shall be treated as an installment acceleration amount with respect to the next succeeding plan year.

                    (III) __Limitation on years to which amounts carried for__ 

                        No amount shall be carried under subclause (I) or (II) to a plan year which begins after the first plan year following the last plan year in the restriction period (or after the second plan year following such last plan year in the case of an election year with respect to which 15-year amortization was elected under paragraph (2)(D)).

                    (IV) __Ordering rules__ 

                        For purposes of applying subclause (II), installment acceleration amounts for the plan year (determined without regard to any carryover under this clause) shall be applied first against the limitation under clause (ii) and then carryovers to such plan year shall be applied against such limitation on a first-in, first-out basis.

            (D) __Excess employee compensation__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __In general__ 

                The term “excess employee compensation” means, with respect to any employee for any plan year, the excess (if any) of—

                    (I) the aggregate amount includible in income under this chapter for remuneration during the calendar year in which such plan year begins for services performed by the employee for the plan sponsor (whether or not performed during such calendar year), over

                    (II) $1,000,000.

                (ii) __Amounts set aside for nonqualified deferred compensation__ 

                    If during any calendar year assets are set aside or reserved (directly or indirectly) in a trust (or other arrangement as determined by the Secretary), or transferred to such a trust or other arrangement, by a plan sponsor for purposes of paying deferred compensation of an employee under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in section 409A) of the plan sponsor, then, for purposes of clause (i), the amount of such assets shall be treated as remuneration of the employee includible in income for the calendar year unless such amount is otherwise includible in income for such year. An amount to which the preceding sentence applies shall not be taken into account under this paragraph for any subsequent calendar year.

                (iii) __Only remuneration for certain post-2009 services counted__ 

                    Remuneration shall be taken into account under clause (i) only to the extent attributable to services performed by the employee for the plan sponsor after February 28, 2010.

                (iv) __Exception for certain equity payments__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        There shall not be taken into account under clause (i)(I) any amount includible in income with respect to the granting after February 28, 2010, of service recipient stock (within the meaning of section 409A) that, upon such grant, is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined under section 83(c)(1)) for at least 5 years from the date of such grant.

                    (II) __Secretarial authority__ 

                        The Secretary may by regulation provide for the application of this clause in the case of a person other than a corporation.

                    (II) __Certain payments under existing contracts__ 

                        Any remuneration consisting of nonqualified deferred compensation, restricted stock, stock options, or stock appreciation rights payable or granted under a written binding contract that was in effect on March 1, 2010, and which was not modified in any material respect before such remuneration is paid.

                (vi) __Self-employed individual treated as employee__ 

                    The term “employee” includes, with respect to a calendar year, a self-employed individual who is treated as an employee under section 401(c) for the taxable year ending during such calendar year, and the term “compensation” shall include earned income of such individual with respect to such self-employment.

                (vii) __Indexing of amount__ 

                In the case of any calendar year beginning after 2010, the dollar amount under clause (i)(II) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

                    (I) such dollar amount, multiplied by

                    (II) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year, determined by substituting “calendar year 2009” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

                 If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $1,000, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1,000.

            (E) __Extraordinary dividends and redemptions__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The amount determined under this subparagraph for any plan year is the excess (if any) of the sum of the dividends declared during the plan year by the plan sponsor plus the aggregate amount paid for the redemption of stock of the plan sponsor redeemed during the plan year over the greater of—

                    (I) the adjusted net income (within the meaning of section 4043 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) of the plan sponsor for the preceding plan year, determined without regard to any reduction by reason of interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, or

                    (II) in the case of a plan sponsor that determined and declared dividends in the same manner for at least 5 consecutive years immediately preceding such plan year, the aggregate amount of dividends determined and declared for such plan year using such manner.

                (ii) __Only certain post-2009 dividends and redemptions counted__

                (iii) __Elections for multiple plans__ 

                    If a plan sponsor makes elections under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to 2 or more plans, the Secretary shall provide rules for the application of this paragraph to such plans, including rules for the ratable allocation of any installment acceleration amount among such plans on the basis of each plan’s relative reduction in the plan’s shortfall amortization installment for the first plan year in the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) (determined without regard to this paragraph).

                (iv) __Mergers and acquisitions__ 

                    The Secretary shall prescribe rules for the application of paragraph (2)(D) and this paragraph in any case where there is a merger or acquisition involving a plan sponsor making the election under paragraph (2)(D).

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the minimum required contribution shall be determined after taking into account any waiver under section 412(c).

            (B) __Coordination with funding standard carryover balance__ 

                To the extent that any plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no amount of the prefunding balance of such plan may be credited under this paragraph in reducing the minimum required contribution.

            (C) __Limitation for underfunded plans__ 

            The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply for any plan year if the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which—

                (i) the value of plan assets for the preceding plan year (as reduced under paragraph (4)(C)), bears to

                (ii) the funding target of the plan for the preceding plan year (determined without regard to subsection (i)(1)),

                is less than 80 percent. In the case of plan years beginning in 2008, the ratio under this subparagraph may be determined using such methods of estimation as the Secretary may prescribe.

                    (II) the ratio for such plan for the plan year beginning after August 31, 2007 and before September 1, 2008, as determined under rules prescribed by the Secretary.

                (ii) __Special rule__ 

                In the case of a plan for which the valuation date is not the first day of the plan year—

                    (I) clause (i) shall apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, and before January 1, 2010, and

                    (II) clause (i)(II) shall apply based on the last plan year beginning before September 1, 2007, as determined under rules prescribed by the Secretary.

                (iii) __Limitation to charities__ 

                    This subparagraph shall not apply to any plan unless such plan is maintained exclusively by one or more organizations described in section 501(c)(3).

        (4) __Effect of balances on amounts treated as value of plan assets__ 

        In the case of any plan maintaining a prefunding balance or a funding standard carryover balance pursuant to this subsection, the amount treated as the value of plan assets shall be deemed to be such amount, reduced as provided in the following subparagraphs:

            (A) __Applicability of shortfall amortization base__ 

                For purposes of subsection (c)(5), the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance, but only if an election under paragraph (3) applying any portion of the prefunding balance in reducing the minimum required contribution is in effect for the plan year.

            (B) __Determination of excess assets, funding shortfall, and funding target attainment percentage__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    For purposes of subsections (a), (c)(4)(B), and (d)(2)(A), the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance.

                (ii) __Special rule for certain binding agreements with PBGC__ 

                    For purposes of subsection (c)(4)(B), the value of plan assets shall not be deemed to be reduced for a plan year by the amount of the specified balance if, with respect to such balance, there is in effect for a plan year a binding written agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which provides that such balance is not available to reduce the minimum required contribution for the plan year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “specified balance” means the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance, as the case may be.

            (C) __Availability of balances in plan year for crediting against minimum required contribution__ 

                For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(i) of this subsection, the value of plan assets is deemed to be such amount, reduced by the amount of the prefunding balance.

        (5) __Election to reduce balance prior to determinations of value of plan assets and crediting against minimum required contribution__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The plan sponsor may elect to reduce by any amount the balance of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance for any plan year (but not below zero). Such reduction shall be effective prior to any determination of the value of plan assets for such plan year under this section and application of the balance in reducing the minimum required contribution for such plan for such plan year pursuant to an election under paragraph (2).

            (B) __Coordination between prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance__ 

                To the extent that any plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no election may be made under subparagraph (A) with respect to the prefunding balance.

        (6) __Prefunding balance__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A prefunding balance maintained by a plan shall consist of a beginning balance of zero, increased and decreased to the extent provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), and adjusted further as provided in paragraph (8).

            (B) __Increases__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                As of the first day of each plan year beginning after 2008, the prefunding balance of a plan shall be increased by the amount elected by the plan sponsor for the plan year. Such amount shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

                    (I) the aggregate total of employer contributions to the plan for the preceding plan year, over—

                    (II) the minimum required contribution for such preceding plan year.

                (ii) __Adjustments for interest__ 

                    Any excess contributions under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for interest accruing for the periods between the first day of the current plan year and the dates on which the excess contributions were made, determined by using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year and by treating contributions as being first used to satisfy the minimum required contribution.

                (iii) __Certain contributions necessary to avoid benefit limitations disregarded__ 

                    The excess described in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be required to make under subsection (b), (c), or (e) of section 436 to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year. Any contribution which may be taken into account in satisfying the requirements of more than 1 of such paragraphs shall be taken into account only once for purposes of this clause.

            (C) __Decreases__ 

            The prefunding balance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by—

                (i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008, the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and

                (ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under paragraph (5).

        (7) __Funding standard carryover balance__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A funding standard carryover balance maintained by a plan shall consist of a beginning balance determined under subparagraph (B), decreased to the extent provided in subparagraph (C), and adjusted further as provided in paragraph (8).

            (B) __Beginning balance__ 

                The beginning balance of the funding standard carryover balance shall be the positive balance described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii)(II).

            (C) __Decreases__ 

            The funding standard carryover balance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by—

                (i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008, the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and

                (ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under paragraph (5).

        (8) __Adjustments for investment experience__ 

            In determining the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance of a plan as of the first day of the plan year, the plan sponsor shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, adjust such balance to reflect the rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year. Notwithstanding subsection (g)(3), such rate of return shall be determined on the basis of fair market value and shall properly take into account, in accordance with such regulations, all contributions, distributions, and other plan payments made during such period.

        (9) __Elections__ 

            Elections under this subsection shall be made at such times, and in such form and manner, as shall be prescribed in regulations of the Secretary.

    (g) __Valuation of plan assets and liabilities__ 

        (1) __Timing of determinations__ 

            Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, all determinations under this section for a plan year shall be made as of the valuation date of the plan for such plan year.

        (2) __Valuation date__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the valuation date of a plan for any plan year shall be the first day of the plan year.

            (B) __Exception for small plans__ 

                If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer participants, the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for such plan year and succeeding plan years. For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans) maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer’s controlled group) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only participants with respect to such employer or member shall be taken into account.

            (C) __Application of certain rules in determination of plan size__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __Plans not in existence in preceding year__ 

                    In the case of the first plan year of any plan, subparagraph (B) shall apply to such plan by taking into account the number of participants that the plan is reasonably expected to have on days during such first plan year.

                (ii) __Predecessors__ 

                    Any reference in subparagraph (B) to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.

        (3) __Determination of value of plan assets__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.

            (B) __Averaging allowed__ 

            A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—

                (i) is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary,

                (ii) does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and

                (iii) does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.

                Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan’s actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third segment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary.

        (4) __Accounting for contribution receipts__ 

        For purposes of determining the value of assets under paragraph (3)—

            (A) __Prior year contributions__ 

            If—

                (i) an employer makes any contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and

                (ii) the contribution is for a preceding plan year,

                the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.

            (B) __Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date__ 

            If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include—

                (i) such contributions, and

                (ii) interest on such contributions for the period between the date of the contributions and the valuation date, determined by using the effective interest rate for the plan year.

    (h) __Actuarial assumptions and methods__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subject to this subsection, the determination of any present value or other computation under this section shall be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—

            (A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and

            (B) which, in combination, offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

        (2) __Interest rates__ 

            (A) __Effective interest rate__ 

                For purposes of this section, the term “effective interest rate” means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of interest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan’s accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding target of the plan for such plan year.

            (B) __Interest rates for determining funding target__ 

            For purposes of determining the funding target and target normal cost of a plan for any plan year, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits of the plan shall be—

                (i) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 5-year period beginning on the first day of the plan year, the first segment rate with respect to the applicable month,

                (ii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i), the second segment rate with respect to the applicable month, and

                (iii) in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable after the period described in clause (ii), the third segment rate with respect to the applicable month.

            (C) __Segment rates__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __First segment rate__ 

                    The term “first segment rate” means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 5-year period commencing with such month.

                (ii) __Second segment rate__ 

                    The term “second segment rate” means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i).

                (iii) __Third segment rate__ 

                    The term “third segment rate” means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during periods beginning after the period described in clause (ii).

                (iv) __Segment rate stabilization__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        If a segment rate described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) with respect to any applicable month (determined without regard to this clause) is less than the applicable minimum percentage, or more than the applicable maximum percentage, of the average of the segment rates described in such clause for years in the 25-year period ending with September 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins, then the segment rate described in such clause with respect to the applicable month shall be equal to the applicable minimum percentage or the applicable maximum percentage of such average, whichever is closest. The Secretary shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available.

                    (II) __Applicable minimum percentage; applicable maximum percentage__ 

                        For purposes of subclause (I), the applicable minimum percentage and the applicable maximum percentage for a plan year beginning in a calendar year shall be determined in accordance with the following table:

<table>

                          <tr>

                            <td> 

                        If the calendar year is:  </td>

                            <td>

            (D) __Corporate bond yield curve__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The term “corporate bond yield curve” means, with respect to any month, a yield curve which is prescribed by the Secretary for such month and which reflects the average, for the 24-month period ending with the month preceding such month, of monthly yields on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and that are in the top 3 quality levels available.

                (ii) __Election to use yield curve__ 

                    Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i). Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

            (E) __Applicable month__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable month” means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the month which includes the valuation date of such plan for such plan year or, at the election of the plan sponsor, any of the 4 months which precede such month. Any election made under this subparagraph shall apply to the plan year for which the election is made and all succeeding plan years, unless the election is revoked with the consent of the Secretary.

            (F) __Publication requirements__ 

                The Secretary shall publish for each month the corporate bond yield curve (and the corporate bond yield curve reflecting the modification described in section 417(e)(3)(D)(i) for such month) and each of the rates determined under subparagraph (C) and the averages determined under subparagraph (C)(iv) for such month. The Secretary shall also publish a description of the methodology used to determine such yield curve and such rates which is sufficiently detailed to enable plans to make reasonable projections regarding the yield curve and such rates for future months based on the plan’s projection of future interest rates.

            (G) __Transition rule__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, for plan years beginning in 2008 or 2009, the first, second, or third segment rate for a plan with respect to any month shall be equal to the sum of—

                    (I) the product of such rate for such month determined without regard to this subparagraph, multiplied by the applicable percentage, and

                    (II) the product of the rate determined under the rules of section 412(b)(5)(B)(ii)(II) (as in effect for plan years beginning in 2007), multiplied by a percentage equal to 100 percent minus the applicable percentage.

                (ii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                    For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage is 33⅓ percent for plan years beginning in 2008 and 66⅔ percent for plan years beginning in 2009.

                (iii) __New plans ineligible__ 

                    Clause (i) shall not apply to any plan if the first plan year of the plan begins after December 31, 2007.

                (iv) __Election__ 

                    The plan sponsor may elect not to have this subparagraph apply. Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

        (3) __Mortality tables__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (C) or (D), the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe mortality tables to be used in determining any present value or making any computation under this section. Such tables shall be based on the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. In prescribing such tables, the Secretary shall take into account results of available independent studies of mortality of individuals covered by pension plans.

            (B) __Periodic revision__ 

                The Secretary shall (at least every 10 years) make revisions in any table in effect under subparagraph (A) to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.

            (C) __Substitute mortality table__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Upon request by the plan sponsor and approval by the Secretary, a mortality table which meets the requirements of clause (iii) shall be used in determining any present value or making any computation under this section during the period of consecutive plan years (not to exceed 10) specified in the request.

                (ii) __Early termination of period__ 

                Notwithstanding clause (i), a mortality table described in clause (i) shall cease to be in effect as of the earliest of—

                    (I) the date on which there is a significant change in the participants in the plan by reason of a plan spinoff or merger or otherwise, or

                    (II) the date on which the plan actuary determines that such table does not meet the requirements of clause (iii).

                (iii) __Requirements__ 

                A mortality table meets the requirements of this clause if—

                    (I) there is a sufficient number of plan participants, and the pension plans have been maintained for a sufficient period of time, to have credible information necessary for purposes of subclause (II), and

                    (II) such table reflects the actual experience of the pension plans maintained by the sponsor and projected trends in general mortality experience.

                (iv) __All plans in controlled group must use separate table__ 

                Except as provided by the Secretary, a plan sponsor may not use a mortality table under this subparagraph for any plan maintained by the plan sponsor unless—

                    (I) a separate mortality table is established and used under this subparagraph for each other plan maintained by the plan sponsor and if the plan sponsor is a member of a controlled group, each member of the controlled group, and

                    (II) the requirements of clause (iii) are met separately with respect to the table so established for each such plan, determined by only taking into account the participants of such plan, the time such plan has been in existence, and the actual experience of such plan.

                (v) __Deadline for submission and disposition of application__ 

                    (I) __Submission__ 

                        The plan sponsor shall submit a mortality table to the Secretary for approval under this subparagraph at least 7 months before the 1st day of the period described in clause (i).

                    (II) __Disposition__ 

                        Any mortality table submitted to the Secretary for approval under this subparagraph shall be treated as in effect as of the 1st day of the period described in clause (i) unless the Secretary, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of such submission, disapproves of such table and provides the reasons that such table fails to meet the requirements of clause (iii). The 180-day period shall be extended upon mutual agreement of the Secretary and the plan sponsor.

            (D) __Separate mortality tables for the disabled__ 

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)—

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Secretary shall establish mortality tables which may be used (in lieu of the tables under subparagraph (A)) under this subsection for individuals who are entitled to benefits under the plan on account of disability. The Secretary shall establish separate tables for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning on or after such date.

                (ii) __Special rule for disabilities occurring after 1994__ 

                    In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under clause (i) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act and the regulations thereunder.

                (iii) __Periodic revision__ 

                    The Secretary shall (at least every 10 years) make revisions in any table in effect under clause (i) to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.

        (4) __Probability of benefit payments in the form of lump sums or other optional forms__ 

        For purposes of determining any present value or making any computation under this section, there shall be taken into account—

            (A) the probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of optional forms of benefits provided under the plan (including lump sum distributions, determined on the basis of the plan’s experience and other related assumptions), and

            (B) any difference in the present value of such future benefit payments resulting from the use of actuarial assumptions, in determining benefit payments in any such optional form of benefits, which are different from those specified in this subsection.

        (5) __Approval of large changes in actuarial assumptions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                No actuarial assumption used to determine the funding target for a plan to which this paragraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary.

            (B) __Plans to which paragraph applies__ 

            This paragraph shall apply to a plan only if—

                (i) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applies,

                (ii) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 4001(a)(13) of such Act) and members of such sponsors’ controlled groups (as defined in section 4001(a)(14) of such Act) which are covered by title IV (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and

                (iii) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the funding shortfall of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the funding target of the plan before such change.

    (i) __Special rules for at-risk plans__ 

        (1) __Funding target for plans in at-risk status__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of a plan which is in at-risk status for a plan year, the funding target of the plan for the plan year shall be equal to the sum of—

                (i) the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, as determined by using the additional actuarial assumptions described in subparagraph (B), and

                (ii) in the case of a plan which also has been in at-risk status for at least 2 of the 4 preceding plan years, a loading factor determined under subparagraph (C).

            (B) __Additional actuarial assumptions__ 

            The actuarial assumptions described in this subparagraph are as follows:

                (i) All employees who are not otherwise assumed to retire as of the valuation date but who will be eligible to elect benefits during the plan year and the 10 succeeding plan years shall be assumed to retire at the earliest retirement date under the plan but not before the end of the plan year for which the at-risk funding target and at-risk target normal cost are being determined.

                (ii) All employees shall be assumed to elect the retirement benefit available under the plan at the assumed retirement age (determined after application of clause (i)) which would result in the highest present value of benefits.

            (C) __Loading factor__ 

            The loading factor applied with respect to a plan under this paragraph for any plan year is the sum of—

                (i) $700, times the number of participants in the plan, plus

                (ii) 4 percent of the funding target (determined without regard to this paragraph) of the plan for the plan year.

        (2) __Target normal cost of at-risk plans__ 

        In the case of a plan which is in at-risk status for a plan year, the target normal cost of the plan for such plan year shall be equal to the sum of—

            (A)

             the excess of—

                (i)

                 the sum of—

                    (I) the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year, determined using the additional actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (1)(B), plus

                    (II) the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year, over

                (ii) the amount of mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year, plus

            (B) in the case of a plan which also has been in at-risk status for at least 2 of the 4 preceding plan years, a loading factor equal to 4 percent of the amount determined under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) with respect to the plan for the plan year.

        (3) __Minimum amount__ 

        In no event shall—

            (A) the at-risk funding target be less than the funding target, as determined without regard to this subsection, or

            (B) the at-risk target normal cost be less than the target normal cost, as determined without regard to this subsection.

        (4) __Determination of at-risk status__
