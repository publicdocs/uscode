## § 58. Denial of certain losses

    (a) __Denial of farm loss__

        For purposes of computing the amount of the alternative minimum taxable income for any taxable year of a taxpayer other than a corporation—

            (A) __Disallowance of farm loss__ 

                No loss of the taxpayer for such taxable year from any tax shelter farm activity shall be allowed.

            (B) __Deduction in succeeding taxable year__ 

                Any loss from a tax shelter farm activity disallowed under subparagraph (A) shall be treated as a deduction allocable to such activity in the 1st succeeding taxable year.

        (2) __Tax shelter farm activity__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “tax shelter farm activity” means—

            (A) any farming syndicate as defined in section 461(j), and

            (B) any other activity consisting of farming which is a passive activity (within the meaning of section 469(c)).

        (3) __Application to personal service corporations__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), a personal service corporation (within the meaning of section 469(j)(2)) shall be treated as a taxpayer other than a corporation.

        (4) __Determination of loss__ 

            In determining the amount of the loss from any tax shelter farm activity, the adjustments of sections 56 and 57 shall apply.

    (b) __Disallowance of passive activity loss__ 

    In computing the alternative minimum taxable income of the taxpayer for any taxable year, section 469 shall apply, except that in applying section 469—

        (1) the adjustments of sections 56 and 57 shall apply, and

        (2) in lieu of applying section 469(j)(7), the passive activity loss of a taxpayer shall be computed without regard to qualified housing interest (as defined in section 56(e)).

    (c) __Special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Special rule for insolvent taxpayers__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The amount of losses to which subsection (a) or (b) applies shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which the taxpayer is insolvent as of the close of the taxable year.

            (B) __Insolvent__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “insolvent” means the excess of liabilities over the fair market value of assets.

        (2) __Loss allowed for year of disposition of farm shelter activity__ 

            If the taxpayer disposes of his entire interest in any tax shelter farm activity during any taxable year, the amount of the loss attributable to such activity (determined after carryovers under subsection (a)(1)(B)) shall (to the extent otherwise allowable) be allowed for such taxable year in computing alternative minimum taxable income and not treated as a loss from a tax shelter farm activity.
