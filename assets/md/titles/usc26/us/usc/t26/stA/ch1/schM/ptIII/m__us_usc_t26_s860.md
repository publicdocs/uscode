## § 860. Deduction for deficiency dividends

    (a) __General rule__ 

        If a determination with respect to any qualified investment entity results in any adjustment for any taxable year, a deduction shall be allowed to such entity for the amount of deficiency dividends for purposes of determining the deduction for dividends paid (for purposes of section 852 or 857, whichever applies) for such year.

    (c) __Rules for application of section__ 

        (1) __Interest and additions to tax determined with respect to the amount of deficiency dividend deduction allowed__ 

        For purposes of determining interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts—

            (A) the tax imposed by this chapter (after taking into account the deduction allowed by subsection (a)) on the qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made shall be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the deduction allowed by subsection (a) with respect to such taxable year,

            (B) the last date prescribed for payment of such increase in tax shall be deemed to have been the last date prescribed for the payment of tax (determined in the manner provided by section 6601(b)) for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made, and

            (C) such increase in tax shall be deemed to be paid as of the date the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction is filed.

        (2) __Credit or refund__ 

            If the allowance of a deficiency dividend deduction results in an overpayment of tax for any taxable year, credit or refund with respect to such overpayment shall be made as if on the date of the determination 2 years remained before the expiration of the period of limitations on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates.

    (d) __Adjustment__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Adjustment in the case of regulated investment company__ 

        In the case of any regulated investment company, the term “adjustment” means—

            (A) any increase in the investment company taxable income of the regulated investment company (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561)),

            (B) any increase in the amount of the excess described in section 852(b)(3)(A) (relating to the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for capital gain dividends paid), and

        (2) __Adjustment in the case of real estate investment trust__

    (f) __Deficiency dividends__ 

        (1) __Definition__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “deficiency dividends” means a distribution of property made by the qualified investment entity on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (g), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists if distributed during such taxable year. No distribution of property shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination, and unless a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction with respect to such distribution is filed pursuant to subsection (g).

        (2) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Ordinary dividends__

                (i) the excess of the amount of increase referred to in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies) over the amount of any increase in the deduction for dividends paid (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) for such taxable year which results from such determination, and

        (3) __Effect on dividends paid deduction__ 

            (A) __For taxable year in which paid__ 

                Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year.

            (B) __For prior taxable year__ 

                Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be allowed for purposes of section 855(a) or 858(a) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.

    (g) __Claim required__ 

        No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefore is filed within 120 days after the date of the determination.

            (B) if claim for a deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (g), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for deficiency dividends provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part), and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.

            No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the collection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.

    (i) __Deduction denied in case of fraud__ 

        No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the determination contains a finding that any part of any deficiency attributable to an adjustment with respect to the taxable year is due to fraud with intent to evade tax or to willfull  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be “willful”. </sup></sup>  failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.
