## § 433. Minimum funding standards

    (a) __General rule__ 

        For purposes of section 412, the term “accumulated funding deficiency” for a CSEC plan means the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which section 412 applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.

    (b) __Funding standard account__ 

        (1) __Account required__ 

            Each plan to which this section applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.

        (2) __Charges to account__ 

        For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of—

            (A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,

            (B)

             the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—

                (i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which section 412 applies, over a period of 40 plan years,

                (ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, but before the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2013, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which section 412 applies, over a period of 30 plan years,

                (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,

                (iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years, and

                (v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years,

            (C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 412(c)(3)) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years,

            (D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D), and

            (E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of section 412(c)(7)(A)(i)(I) (as in effect on the day before the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006).

        (3) __Credits to account__ 

        For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of—

            (A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,

            (B)

             the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—

                (i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,

                (ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years, and

                (iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years,

            (C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 412(c)(3)) for the plan year, and

            (D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.

        (4) __Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized__ 

        Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be—

            (A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and

            (B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.

        (5) __Interest__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.

            (B) __Exception__ 

            The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) or for purposes of any arrangement under subsection (d) for any plan year shall be the greater of—

                (i) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 for the 1st month of such plan year), or

                (ii) the rate of interest determined under subparagraph (A).

        (6) __Amortization schedules in effect__ 

            Amortization schedules for amounts described in paragraphs (2) and (3) that are in effect as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 2014, by reason of section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 shall remain in effect pursuant to their terms and this section, except that such amounts shall not be amortized again under this section.

    (c) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __Determinations to be made under funding method__ 

            For purposes of this section, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.

        (2) __Valuation of assets__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this section, the value of the plan’s assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

            (B) __Dedicated bond portfolio__ 

                The Secretary may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of a plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under section 412(b)(5) (as in effect on the day before the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006).

        (3) __Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable__ 

        For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—

            (A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and

            (B) which, in combination, offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

        (4) __Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss__ 

        For purposes of this section, if—

            (A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or

            (B) a change in the definition of the term “wages” under section 3121 or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5),

            results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.

        (5) __Funding method and plan year__ 

            (A) __Funding methods available__ 

                All funding methods available to CSEC plans under section 412 (as in effect on the day before the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) shall continue to be available under this section.

            (B) __Changes__ 

                If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary.

            (C) __Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (h)(3)) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary.

                (ii) __Plans to which subparagraph applies__ 

                This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if—

                    (I) the plan is a CSEC plan,

                    (II) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 4001(a)(13) of such Act) and members of such sponsors’ controlled groups (as defined in section 4001(a)(14) of such Act) which are covered by title IV  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by “of such Act”. </sup></sup>  (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and

                    (III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the funding shortfall of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.

        (6) __Full funding__ 

        If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under subsection (e)) in excess of the full funding limitation—

            (A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and

            (B) all amounts described in paragraphs (2)(B), (C), and (D) and (3)(B) of subsection (b) which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such paragraphs.

        (7) __Full-funding limitation__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (6), the term “full-funding limitation” means the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the accrued liability (including normal cost) under the plan (determined under the entry age normal funding method if such accrued liability cannot be directly calculated under the funding method used for the plan), over

            (B)

             the lesser of—

                (i) the fair market value of the plan’s assets, or

                (ii) the value of such assets determined under paragraph (2).

            (C) __Minimum amount.—__ 

                (i)  __In general__  __.—__ 

                In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of—

                    (I) 90 percent of the current liability (determined without regard to paragraph (4) of subsection (h)) of the plan (including the expected increase in such current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), over

                    (II) the value of the plan’s assets determined under paragraph (2).

                (ii)  __Assets__  __.—__ 

                For purposes of clause (i), assets shall not be reduced by any credit balance in the funding standard account.

        (8) __Annual valuation__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this section, a determination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan’s liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

            (B) __Valuation date__ 

                (i) __Current year__ 

                    Except as provided in clause (ii), the valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be made as of a date within the plan year to which the valuation refers or within one month prior to the beginning of such year.

                (ii) __Use of prior year valuation__ 

                    The valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) may be made as of a date within the plan year prior to the year to which the valuation refers if, as of such date, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 100 percent of the plan’s current liability.

                (iii) __Adjustments__ 

                    Information under clause (ii) shall, in accordance with regulations, be actuarially adjusted to reflect significant differences in participants.

                (iv) __Limitation__ 

                    A change in funding method to use a prior year valuation, as provided in clause (ii), may not be made unless as of the valuation date within the prior plan year, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 125 percent of the plan’s current liability.

        (9) __Time when certain contributions deemed made__ 

        For purposes of this section, any contributions for a plan year made by an employer during the period—

            (A) beginning on the day after the last day of such plan year, and

            (B) ending on the day which is 8½ months after the close of the plan year,

            shall be deemed to have been made on such last day.

        (10) __Anticipation of benefit increases effective in the future__ 

            In determining projected benefits, the funding method of a collectively bargained CSEC plan described in section 413(a) shall anticipate benefit increases scheduled to take effect during the term of the collective bargaining agreement applicable to the plan.

    (d) __Extension of amortization periods__ 

    The period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability (described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B)) of any plan may be extended by the Secretary for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years) if the Secretary determines that such extension would carry out the purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and if the Secretary determines that the failure to permit such extension would result in—

        (1) a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or

        (2) a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation.

    (e) __Alternative minimum funding standard__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A CSEC plan which uses a funding method that requires contributions in all years not less than those required under the entry age normal funding method may maintain an alternative minimum funding standard account for any plan year. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this subsection.

        (2) __Charges and credits to account__ 

        For a plan year the alternative minimum funding standard account shall be—

            (A)

             charged with the sum of—

                (i) the lesser of normal cost under the funding method used under the plan or normal cost determined under the unit credit method,

                (ii) the excess, if any, of the present value of accrued benefits under the plan over the fair market value of the assets, and

                (iii) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of credits to the alternative minimum standard account for all prior plan years over charges to such account for all such years, and

            (B) credited with the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year.

        (3) __Interest__ 

            The alternative minimum funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited with interest in the manner provided under subsection (b)(5) with respect to the funding standard account.

    (f) __Quarterly contributions required__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If a CSEC plan which has a funded current liability percentage for the preceding plan year of less than 100 percent fails to pay the full amount of a required installment for the plan year, then the rate of interest charged to the funding standard account under subsection (b)(5) with respect to the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment shall be equal to the greater of—

            (A) 175 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 for the 1st month of such plan year), or

            (B) the rate of interest used under the plan in determining costs.

        (2) __Amount of underpayment, period of underpayment__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1)—

            (A) __Amount__ 

            The amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of—

                (i) the required installment, over

                (ii) the amount (if any) of the installment contributed to or under the plan on or before the due date for the installment.

            (B) __Period of underpayment__ 

                The period for which interest is charged under this subsection with regard to any portion of the underpayment shall run from the due date for the installment to the date on which such portion is contributed to or under the plan (determined without regard to subsection (c)(9)).

            (C) __Order of crediting contributions__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), contributions shall be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which such installments are required to be paid.

        (3) __Number of required installments; due dates__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Payable in 4 installments__

            (B) __Required annual payment__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “required annual payment” means the lesser of—

                (i) 90 percent of the amount required to be contributed to or under the plan by the employer for the plan year under section 412 (without regard to any waiver under subsection (c) thereof), or

                (ii) 100 percent of the amount so required for the preceding plan year.

                Clause (ii) shall not apply if the preceding plan year was not a year of 12 months.

        (5) __Liquidity requirement__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A plan to which this paragraph applies shall be treated as failing to pay the full amount of any required installment to the extent that the value of the liquid assets paid in such installment is less than the liquidity shortfall (whether or not such liquidity shortfall exceeds the amount of such installment required to be paid but for this paragraph).

            (B) __Plans to which paragraph applies__ 

            This paragraph shall apply to a CSEC plan other than a plan described in section 412(l)(6)(A) (as in effect on the day before the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) which—

                (i) is required to pay installments under this subsection for a plan year, and

                (ii) has a liquidity shortfall for any quarter during such plan year.

            (C) __Period of underpayment__ 

                For purposes of paragraph (1), any portion of an installment that is treated as not paid under subparagraph (A) shall continue to be treated as unpaid until the close of the quarter in which the due date for such installment occurs.

            (D) __Limitation on increase__ 

                If the amount of any required installment is increased by reason of subparagraph (A), in no event shall such increase exceed the amount which, when added to prior installments for the plan year, is necessary to increase the funded current liability percentage (taking into account the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year) to 100 percent.

            (E) __Definitions__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __Liquidity shortfall__ 

                    The term “liquidity shortfall” means, with respect to any required installment, an amount equal to the excess (as of the last day of the quarter for which such installment is made) of the base amount with respect to such quarter over the value (as of such last day) of the plan’s liquid assets.

Such tables shall be based upon the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. In prescribing such tables, the Secretary shall take into account results of available independent studies of mortality of individuals covered by pension plans.

                (ii) __Periodic review__ 

                    The Secretary shall periodically (at least every 5 years) review any tables in effect under this subsection and shall, to the extent the Secretary determines necessary, by regulation update the tables to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.

            (C) __Separate mortality tables for the disabled__ 

            Notwithstanding subparagraph (B)—

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 1995, the Secretary shall establish mortality tables which may be used (in lieu of the tables under subparagraph (B)) to determine current liability under this subsection for individuals who are entitled to benefits under the plan on account of disability. The Secretary shall establish separate tables for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning on or after such date.

                (ii) __Special rule for disabilities occurring after 1994__ 

                    In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under clause (i) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act and the regulations thereunder.

        (4) __Certain service disregarded__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a participant to whom this paragraph applies, only the applicable percentage of the years of service before such individual became a participant shall be taken into account in computing the current liability of the plan.

            (B) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of this subparagraph, the applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:

<table>

                  <tr>

                    <td>

                    <td> 

                 The applicable percentage is:  </td>

  </tr>

  </tr>

                  <tr>

                    <td> 

                4  </td>

                    <td> 

                80   </td>

  </tr>

                  <tr>

                    <td> 

                5 or more  </td>

                    <td> 

                100.  </td>

  </tr>

                </table>

            (C) __Participants to whom paragraph applies__ 

            This subparagraph shall apply to any participant who, at the time of becoming a participant—

                (i) has not accrued any other benefit under any defined benefit plan (whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer or a member of the same controlled group of which the employer is a member,

                (ii) who first becomes a participant under the plan in a plan year beginning after December 31, 1987, and

                (iii) has years of service greater than the minimum years of service necessary for eligibility to participate in the plan.

            (D) __Election__ 

                An employer may elect not to have this subparagraph apply. Such an election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

    (i) __Funded current liability percentage__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “funded current liability percentage” means, with respect to any plan year, the percentage which—

        (1) the value of the plan’s assets determined under subsection (c)(2), is of

        (2) the current liability under the plan.

    (j) __Funding restoration status__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section—

        (1) __Normal cost payment__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of a CSEC plan that is in funding restoration status for a plan year, for purposes of section 412, the term “accumulated funding deficiency” means, for such plan year, the greater of—

                (i) the amount described in subsection (a), or

                (ii) the excess of the normal cost of the plan for the plan year over the amount actually contributed to or under the plan for the plan year.

            (B) __Normal cost__ 

                In the case of a CSEC plan that uses a spread gain funding method, for purposes of this subsection, the term “normal cost” means normal cost as determined under the entry age normal funding method.

        (2) __Plan amendments__ 

            In the case of a CSEC plan that is in funding restoration status for a plan year, no amendment to such plan may take effect during such plan year if such amendment has the effect of increasing liabilities of the plan by means of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment that is required to comply with any applicable law. This paragraph shall cease to apply with respect to any plan year, effective as of the first day of the plan year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment) upon payment by the plan sponsor of a contribution to the plan (in addition to any contribution required under this section without regard to this paragraph) in an amount equal to the increase in the funding liability of the plan attributable to the plan amendment.

        (3) __Funding restoration plan__ 

            The sponsor of a CSEC plan shall establish a written funding restoration plan within 180 days of the receipt by the plan sponsor of a certification from the plan actuary that the plan is in funding restoration status for a plan year. Such funding restoration plan shall consist of actions that are calculated, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to increase the plan’s funded percentage to 100 percent over a period that is not longer than the greater of 7 years or the shortest amount of time practicable. Such funding restoration plan shall take into account contributions required under this section (without regard to this paragraph). If a plan remains in funding restoration status for 2 or more years, such funding restoration plan shall be updated each year after the 1st such year within 180 days of receipt by the plan sponsor of a certification from the plan actuary that the plan remains in funding restoration status for the plan year.

        (4) __Annual certification by plan actuary__ 

        Not later than the 90th day of each plan year of a CSEC plan, the plan actuary shall certify to the plan sponsor whether or not the plan is in funding restoration status for the plan year, based on the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of the plan year. For this purpose, the actuary may conclusively rely on an estimate of—

            (A) the plan’s funding liability, based on the funding liability of the plan for the preceding plan year and on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods, and

            (B) the amount of any contributions reasonably anticipated to be made for the preceding plan year.

            Contributions described in subparagraph (B) shall be taken into account in determining the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of the plan year.

        (5) __Definitions__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Funding restoration status__ 

                A CSEC plan shall be treated as in funding restoration status for a plan year if the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of such plan year is less than 80 percent.

            (B) __Funded percentage__ 

            The term “funded percentage” means the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which—

                (i) the value of plan assets (as determined under subsection (c)(2)), bears to

                (ii) the plan’s funding liability.

            (C) __Funding liability__ 

                The term “funding liability” for a plan year means the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, based on the assumptions used by the plan pursuant to this section, including the interest rate described in subsection (b)(5)(A) (without regard to subsection (b)(5)(B)).

            (D) __Spread gain funding method__ 

                The term “spread gain funding method” has the meaning given such term under rules and forms issued by the Secretary.

            (E) __Plan sponsor__ 

                The term “plan sponsor” means, with respect to a CSEC plan, the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives of the parties who establish or maintain the plan.
