        (2) $1,000 in any other case.

    (c) __Qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property__ 

    For purposes of this section, the term “qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property” has the same meaning as the term “qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property” would have under section 179A if—

        (1) paragraph (1) of section 179A(d) did not apply to property installed on property which is used as the principal residence (within the meaning of section 121) of the taxpayer, and

        (2)

         only the following were treated as clean-burning fuels for purposes of section 179A(d):

            (A) Any fuel at least 85 percent of the volume of which consists of one or more of the following: ethanol, natural gas, compressed natural gas, liquified natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or hydrogen.

            (C) Electricity.

    (d) __Application with other credits__

            So much of the credit which would be allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year (determined without regard to this subsection) that is attributable to property of a character subject to an allowance for depreciation shall be treated as a credit listed in section 38(b) for such taxable year (and not allowed under subsection (a)).

        (2) __Personal credit__ 

        The credit allowed under subsection (a) (after the application of paragraph (1)) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the regular tax liability (as defined in section 26(b)) reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subpart A and section 27, over

            (B) the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year.

    (e) __Special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Basis reduction__ 

            The basis of any property shall be reduced by the portion of the cost of such property taken into account under subsection (a).

        (2) __Property used by tax-exempt entity__ 

            In the case of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property the use of which is described in paragraph (3) or (4) of section 50(b) and which is not subject to a lease, the person who sold such property to the person or entity using such property shall be treated as the taxpayer that placed such property in service, but only if such person clearly discloses to such person or entity in a document the amount of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to such property (determined without regard to subsection (d)). For purposes of subsection (d), property to which this paragraph applies shall be treated as of a character subject to an allowance for depreciation.

        (3) __Property used outside United States not qualified__

        (5) __Recapture rules__ 

            Rules similar to the rules of section 179A(e)(4) shall apply.

        (6) __Special rule for property placed in service during 2009 and 2010__
