## § 461. General rule for taxable year of deduction

    (a) __General rule__ 

        The amount of any deduction or credit allowed by this subtitle shall be taken for the taxable year which is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income.

    (b) __Special rule in case of death__ 

        In the case of the death of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, any amount accrued as a deduction or credit only by reason of the death of the taxpayer shall not be allowed in computing taxable income for the period in which falls the date of the taxpayer’s death.

    (c) __Accrual of real property taxes__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If the taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, then, at the election of the taxpayer, any real property tax which is related to a definite period of time shall be accrued ratably over that period.

        (2) __When election may be made__ 

            (A) __Without consent__ 

                A taxpayer may, without the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection for his first taxable year in which he incurs real property taxes. Such an election shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such year (including extensions thereof).

            (B) __With consent__ 

                A taxpayer may, with the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection at any time.

    (d) __Limitation on acceleration of accrual of taxes__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

            In the case of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, to the extent that the time for accruing taxes is earlier than it would be but for any action of any taxing jurisdiction taken after December 31, 1960, then, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such taxes shall be treated as accruing at the time they would have accrued but for such action by such taxing jurisdiction.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall be inapplicable to any item of tax to the extent that its application would (but for this paragraph) prevent all persons (including successors in interest) from ever taking such item into account.

    (e) __Dividends or interest paid on certain deposits or withdrawable accounts__ 

        Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable accounts (if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice to withdraw) by a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, a domestic building and loan association, or a cooperative bank shall not be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months. Any such amount not allowed as a deduction as the result of the application of the preceding sentence shall be allowed as a deduction for such other taxable year as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the preceding sentence.

    (f) __Contested liabilities__ 

    If—

        (1) the taxpayer contests an asserted liability,

        (2) the taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the asserted liability,

        (3) the contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time of the transfer, and

        (4) but for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or for an earlier taxable year) determined after application of subsection (h),

        then the deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer. This subsection shall not apply in respect of the deduction for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States.

    (g) __Prepaid interest__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, interest paid by the taxpayer which, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, is properly allocable to any period—

            (A) with respect to which the interest represents a charge for the use or forbearance of money, and

            (B) which is after the close of the taxable year in which paid,

            shall be charged to capital account and shall be treated as paid in the period to which so allocable.

        (2) __Exception__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to points paid in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with the purchase or improvement of, and secured by, the principal residence of the taxpayer to the extent that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such payment of points is an established business practice in the area in which such indebtedness is incurred, and the amount of such payment does not exceed the amount generally charged in such area.

    (h) __Certain liabilities not incurred before economic performance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this title, in determining whether an amount has been incurred with respect to any item during any taxable year, the all events test shall not be treated as met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to such item occurs.

        (2) __Time when economic performance occurs__ 

        Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the time when economic performance occurs shall be determined under the following principles:

            (A) __Services and property provided to the tax­payer__ 

            If the liability of the taxpayer arises out of—

                (i) the providing of services to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as such person provides such services,

                (ii) the providing of property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as the person provides such property, or

                (iii) the use of property by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer uses such property.

            (B) __Services and property provided by the taxpayer__ 

                If the liability of the taxpayer requires the taxpayer to provide property or services, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer provides such property or services.

            (C) __Workers compensation and tort liabilities of the taxpayer__ 

            If the liability of the taxpayer requires a payment to another person and—

                (i) arises under any workers compensation act, or

                (ii) arises out of any tort,

                economic performance occurs as the payments to such person are made. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to any liability described in the preceding sentence.

            (D) __Other items__ 

                In the case of any other liability of the taxpayer, economic performance occurs at the time determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

        (3) __Exception for certain recurring items__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Notwithstanding paragraph (1) an item shall be treated as incurred during any taxable year if—

                (i) the all events test with respect to such item is met during such taxable year (determined without regard to paragraph (1)),

                (ii)

                 economic performance with respect to such item occurs within the shorter of—

                    (I) a reasonable period after the close of such taxable year, or

                    (II) 8½ months after the close of such taxable year,

                (iii) such item is recurring in nature and the taxpayer consistently treats items of such kind as incurred in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met, and

                (iv)

                 either—

                    (I) such item is not a material item, or

                    (II) the accrual of such item in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met results in a more proper match against income than accruing such item in the taxable year in which economic performance occurs.

            (B) __Financial statements considered under subparagraph (A)(iv)__ 

                In making a determination under subparagraph (A)(iv), the treatment of such item on financial statements shall be taken into account.

            (C) __Paragraph not to apply to workers compensation and tort liabilities__ 

                This paragraph shall not apply to any item described in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2).

        (4) __All events test__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the all events test is met with respect to any item if all events have occurred which determine the fact of liability and the amount of such liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.

        (5) __Subsection not to apply to certain items__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to any item for which a deduction is allowable under a provision of this title which specifically provides for a deduction for a reserve for estimated expenses.

    (i) __Special rules for tax shelters__ 

        (1) __Recurring item exception not to apply__ 

            In the case of a tax shelter, economic performance shall be determined without regard to paragraph (3) of subsection (h).

        (2) __Special rule for spudding of oil or gas wells__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                In the case of a tax shelter, economic performance with respect to amounts paid during the taxable year for drilling an oil or gas well shall be treated as having occurred within a taxable year if drilling of the well commences before the close of the 90th day after the close of the taxable year.

            (B) __Deduction limited to cash basis__ 

                (i) __Tax shelter partnerships__ 

                    In the case of a tax shelter which is a partnership, in applying section 704(d) to a deduction or loss for any taxable year attributable to an item which is deductible by reason of subparagraph (A), the term “cash basis” shall be substituted for the term “adjusted basis”.

                (ii) __Other tax shelters__ 

                    Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in the case of a tax shelter other than a partnership, the aggregate amount of the deductions allowable by reason of subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall be limited in a manner similar to the limitation under clause (i).

            (C) __Cash basis defined__

                 any amount borrowed by the partner with respect to such partnership which—

            In the case of the trade or business of farming (as defined in section 464(e)), in determining whether an entity is a tax shelter, the definition of farming syndicate in subsection (j) shall be substituted for subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (3).
