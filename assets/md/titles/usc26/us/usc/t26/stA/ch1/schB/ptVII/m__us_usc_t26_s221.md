        (2) __Limitation based on modified adjusted gross income__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The amount which would (but for this paragraph) be allowable as a deduction under this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount determined under subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Amount of reduction__ 

            The amount determined under this subparagraph is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which would be so taken into account as—

                (i)

                 the excess of—

                    (I) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over

                    (II) $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return), bears to

                (ii) $15,000 ($30,000 in the case of a joint return).

            (C) __Modified adjusted gross income__ 

            The term “modified adjusted gross income” means adjusted gross income determined—

                (i) without regard to this section and sections 199, 222, 911, 931, and 933, and

                (ii) after application of sections 86, 135, 137, 219, and 469.

    (c) __Dependents not eligible for deduction__ 

        No deduction shall be allowed by this section to an individual for the taxable year if a deduction under section 151 with respect to such individual is allowed to another taxpayer for the taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which such individual’s taxable year begins.

    (d) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Qualified education loan__ 

        The term “qualified education loan” means any indebtedness incurred by the taxpayer solely to pay qualified higher education expenses—

            (A) which are incurred on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, or any dependent of the taxpayer as of the time the indebtedness was incurred,

            (B) which are paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the indebtedness is incurred, and

            (C) which are attributable to education furnished during a period during which the recipient was an eligible student.

            Such term includes indebtedness used to refinance indebtedness which qualifies as a qualified education loan. The term “qualified education loan” shall not include any indebtedness owed to a person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the taxpayer or to any person by reason of a loan under any qualified employer plan (as defined in section 72(p)(4)) or under any contract referred to in section 72(p)(5).

        (2) __Qualified higher education expenses__ 

        The term “qualified higher education expenses” means the cost of attendance (as defined in section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, [20 U.S.C. 1087][/us/usc/t20/s1087]ll, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) at an eligible educational institution, reduced by the sum of—

            (A) the amount excluded from gross income under section 127, 135, 529, or 530 by reason of such expenses, and

            (B) the amount of any scholarship, allowance, or payment described in section 25A(g)(2).

            For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “eligible educational institution” has the same meaning given such term by section 25A(f)(2), except that such term shall also include an institution conducting an internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility which offers postgraduate training.

        (3) __Eligible student__ 

            The term “eligible student” has the meaning given such term by section 25A(b)(3).

        (4) __Dependent__ 

            The term “dependent” has the meaning given such term by section 152 (determined without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof).

    (e) __Special rules__ 

        (1) __Denial of double benefit__ 

            No deduction shall be allowed under this section for any amount for which a deduction is allowable under any other provision of this chapter.

        (2) __Married couples must file joint return__ 

            If the taxpayer is married at the close of the taxable year, the deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) only if the taxpayer and the taxpayer’s spouse file a joint return for the taxable year.

        (3) __Marital status__ 

            Marital status shall be determined in accordance with section 7703.

    (f) __Inflation adjustments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In the case of a taxable year beginning after 2002, the $50,000 and $100,000 amounts in subsection (b)(2) shall each be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2001” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

        (2) __Rounding__ 

            If any amount as adjusted under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of $5,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $5,000.
