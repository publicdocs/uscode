            (D) __Special rule for interests in partnerships and trusts__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) an interest in a partnership or trust shall not be treated as an asset of the company, but

                (ii) it involves the performance of administrative services in connection with plans providing life insurance, pension, or accident and health benefits.

            (C) __Limitation on amount of loss from noninsurance business which may offset income from insurance business__

        (2) __Nonlife insurance members included for asset test__
