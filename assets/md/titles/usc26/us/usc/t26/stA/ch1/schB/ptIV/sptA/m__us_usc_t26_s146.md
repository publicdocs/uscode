## § 146. Volume cap

    (a) __General rule__ 

        A private activity bond issued as part of an issue meets the requirements of this section if the aggregate face amount of the private activity bonds issued pursuant to such issue, when added to the aggregate face amount of tax-exempt private activity bonds previously issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year, does not exceed such authority’s volume cap for such calendar year.

    (b) __Volume cap for State agencies__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            The volume cap for any agency of the State authorized to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds for any calendar year shall be 50 percent of the State ceiling for such calendar year.

        (2) __Special rule where State has more than 1 agency__ 

            If more than 1 agency of the State is authorized to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds, all such agencies shall be treated as a single agency.

    (c) __Volume cap for other issuers__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The volume cap for any issuing authority (other than a State agency) for any calendar year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the State ceiling for such calendar year as—

            (A) the population of the jurisdiction of such issuing authority, bears to

            (B) the population of the entire State.

        (2) __Overlapping jurisdictions__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), if an area is within the jurisdiction of 2 or more governmental units, such area shall be treated as only within the jurisdiction of the unit having jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area unless such unit agrees to surrender all or part of such jurisdiction for such calendar year to the unit with overlapping jurisdiction which has the next smallest geographical area.

    (d) __State ceiling__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The State ceiling applicable to any State for any calendar year shall be the greater of—

            (A) an amount equal to $75 ($62.50 in the case of calendar year 2001) multiplied by the State population, or

            (B) $225,000,000 ($187,500,000 in the case of calendar year 2001).

        (2) __Cost-of-living adjustment__ 

        In the case of a calendar year after 2002, each of the dollar amounts contained in paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to—

            (A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

            (B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting “calendar year 2001” for “calendar year 1992” in subparagraph (B) thereof.

            If any increase determined under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $5 ($5,000 in the case of the dollar amount in paragraph (1)(B)), such increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple thereof.

        (3) __Special rule for States with constitutional home rule cities__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

                The volume cap for any constitutional home rule city for any calendar year shall be determined under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) by substituting “100 percent” for “50 percent”.

            (B) __Coordination with other allocations__ 

                In the case of any State which contains 1 or more constitutional home rule cities, for purposes of applying subsections (b) and (c) with respect to issuing authorities in such State other than constitutional home rule cities, the State ceiling for any calendar year shall be reduced by the aggregate volume caps determined for such year for all constitutional home rule cities in such State.

            (C) __Constitutional home rule city__ 

                For purposes of this section, the term “constitutional home rule city” means, with respect to any calendar year, any political subdivision of a State which, under a State constitution which was adopted in 1970 and effective on July 1, 1971, had home rule powers on the 1st day of the calendar year.

            (B) __Limitation__

                (i)

                 the fraction—

                    (I) the numerator of which is the amount applicable under paragraph (1)(B) for such calendar year, and

                    (II) the denominator of which is the State population of the least populous State (other than a possession) for such calendar year, and
