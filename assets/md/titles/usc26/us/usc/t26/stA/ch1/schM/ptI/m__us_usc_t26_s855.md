## § 855. Dividends paid by regulated investment company after close of taxable year

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of this chapter, if a regulated investment company—

        (1)

         declares a dividend before the later of—

            (A) the 15th day of the 9th month following the close of the taxable year, or

            (B) in the case of an extension of time for filing the company’s return for the taxable year, the due date for filing such return taking into account such extension, and

        (2) distributes the amount of such dividend to shareholders in the 12-month period following the close of such taxable year and not later than the date of the first dividend payment of the same type of dividend made after such declaration,

        the amount so declared and distributed shall, to the extent the company elects in such return in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be considered as having been paid during such taxable year, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c). For purposes of paragraph (2), a dividend attributable to any short-term capital gain with respect to which a notice is required under the Investment Company Act of 1940 shall be treated as the same type of dividend as a capital gain dividend.

    (b) __Receipt by shareholder__ 

        Except as provided in section 852(b)(7), amounts to which subsection (a) is applicable shall be treated as received by the shareholder in the taxable year in which the distribution is made.

    (c) __Foreign tax election__ 

        If an investment company to which section 853 is applicable for the taxable year makes a distribution as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the shareholders shall consider the amounts described in section 853(b)(2) allocable to such distribution as paid or received, as the case may be, in the taxable year in which the distribution is made.
