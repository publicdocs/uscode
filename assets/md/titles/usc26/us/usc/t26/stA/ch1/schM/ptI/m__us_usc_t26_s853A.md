        (2)

         the regulated investment company shall—

        (3)

         each shareholder of such investment company shall—

            (A) include in gross income an amount equal to such shareholder’s proportionate share of the interest income attributable to such credits, and

            (B) be allowed the shareholder’s proportionate share of such credits against the tax imposed by this chapter.

    (c) __Statements to shareholders__ 

    For purposes of subsection (b)(3), the shareholder’s proportionate share of—

            The term “tax credit bond” means—

                (i) a qualified tax credit bond (as defined in section 54A(d)),

                (ii) a build America bond (as defined in section 54AA(d)), and

                (iii) any bond for which a credit is allowable under subpart H of part IV of subchapter A of this chapter.
