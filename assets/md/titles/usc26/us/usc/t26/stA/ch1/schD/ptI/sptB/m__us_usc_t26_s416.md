        (1) __Defined benefit plans__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A defined benefit plan meets the requirements of this subsection if the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions of each participant who is a non-key employee, when expressed as an annual retirement benefit, is not less than the applicable percentage of the participant’s average compensation for years in the testing period.

            (B) __Applicable percentage__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percentage” means the lesser of—

                (i) 2 percent multiplied by the number of years of service with the employer, or

                (ii) 20 percent.

            (C) __Years of service__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (ii) __Exception for years during which plan was not top-heavy__ 

                A year of service with the employer shall not be taken into account under this paragraph if—

                    (II) such year of service was completed in a plan year beginning before January 1, 1984.

                (iii) __Exception for plan under which no key employee (or former key employee) benefits for plan year__ 

                    For purposes of determining an employee’s years of service with the employer, any service with the employer shall be disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a plan year when the plan benefits (within the meaning of section 410(b)) no key employee or former key employee.

            (D) __Average compensation for high 5 years__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph—

                (i) __In general__ 

                    A participant’s testing period shall be the period of consecutive years (not exceeding 5) during which the participant had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer.

                (ii) __Year must be included in year of service__ 

                    The years taken into account under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for years not included in a year of service.

                (iii) __Certain years not taken into account__ 

                Except to the extent provided in the plan, a year shall not be taken into account under clause (i) if—

                    (I) such year ends in a plan year beginning before January 1, 1984, or

                    (II) such year begins after the close of the last year in which the plan was a top-heavy plan.

            (E) __Annual retirement benefit__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “annual retirement benefit” means a benefit payable annually in the form of a single life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) beginning at the normal retirement age under the plan.

        (2) __Defined contribution plans__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A defined contribution plan meets the requirements of the subsection if the employer contribution for the year for each participant who is a non-key employee is not less than 3 percent of such participant’s compensation (within the meaning of section 415). Employer matching contributions (as defined in section 401(m)(4)(A)) shall be taken into account for purposes of this subparagraph (and any reduction under this sentence shall not be taken into account in determining whether section 401(k)(4)(A) applies).

            (B) __Special rule where maximum contribution less than 3 percent__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The percentage referred to in subparagraph (A) for any year shall not exceed the percentage at which contributions are made (or required to be made) under the plan for the year for the key employee for whom such percentage is the highest for the year.

                (ii) __Treatment of aggregation groups__ 

                    (I) For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined contribution plans required to be included in an aggregation group under subsection (g)(2)(A)(i) shall be treated as one plan.

                    (II) This subparagraph shall not apply to any plan required to be included in an aggregation group if such plan enables a defined benefit plan required to be included in such group to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) or 410.

    \[(d) __Repealed.__  __[__  __Pub. L. 99–514, title XI, § 1106(d)(3)(B)(i)__  __][/us/pl/99/514/s1106/d/3/B/i]__  __,__  __Oct. 22, 1986__  __,__  __[__  __100 Stat. 2424__  __][/us/stat/100/2424]__  __\]__ 

    (e) __Plan must meet requirements without taking into account social security and similar contributions and benefits__

    (f) __Coordination where employer has 2 or more plans__ 

        The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section where the employer has 2 or more plans including (but not limited to) regulations to prevent inappropriate omissions or required duplication of minimum benefits or contributions.

    (g) __Top-heavy plan defined__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Plans not required to be aggregated__ 

            Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “top-heavy plan” means, with respect to any plan year—

                (i) any defined benefit plan if, as of the determination date, the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits under the plan for key employees exceeds 60 percent of the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits under the plan for all employees, and

                (ii) any defined contribution plan if, as of the determination date, the aggregate of the accounts of key employees under the plan exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate of the accounts of all employees under such plan.

            (B) __Aggregated plans__ 

                Each plan of an employer required to be included in an aggregation group shall be treated as a top-heavy plan if such group is a top-heavy group.

        (2) __Aggregation__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Aggregation group__ 

                (i) __Required aggregation__ 

                The term “aggregation group” means—

                    (I) each plan of the employer in which a key employee is a participant, and

                    (II) each other plan of the employer which enables any plan described in subclause (I) to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) or 410.

                (ii) __Permissive aggregation__ 

                    The employer may treat any plan not required to be included in an aggregation group under clause (i) as being part of such group if such group would continue to meet the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410 with such plan being taken into account.

            (B) __Top-heavy group__ 

            The term “top-heavy group” means any aggregation group if—

                (i)

                 the sum (as of the determination date) of—

                    (I) the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for key employees under all defined benefit plans included in such group, and

                    (II) the aggregate of the accounts of key employees under all defined contribution plans included in such group,

                (ii) exceeds 60 percent of a similar sum determined for all employees.

        (3) __Distributions during last year before determination date taken into account__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of determining—

                (i) the present value of the cumulative accrued benefit for any employee, or

                (ii) the amount of the account of any employee,

                such present value or amount shall be increased by the aggregate distributions made with respect to such employee under the plan during the 1-year period ending on the determination date. The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have been required to be included in an aggregation group.

            (B) __5-year period in case of in-service distribution__ 

                In the case of any distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death, or disability, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “5-year period” for “1-year period”.

        (4) __Other special rules__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Rollover contributions to plan not taken into account__ 

                Except to the extent provided in regulations, any rollover contribution (or similar transfer) initiated by the employee and made after December 31, 1983, to a plan shall not be taken into account with respect to the transferee plan for purposes of determining whether such plan is a top-heavy plan (or whether any aggregation group which includes such plan is a top-heavy group).

            (B) __Benefits not taken into account if employee ceases to be key employee__ 

                If any individual is a non-key employee with respect to any plan for any plan year, but such individual was a key employee with respect to such plan for any prior plan year, any accrued benefit for such employee (and the account of such employee) shall not be taken into account.

            (C) __Determination date__ 

            The term “determination date” means, with respect to any plan year—

                (i) the last day of the preceding plan year, or

                (ii) in the case of the first plan year of any plan, the last day of such plan year.

            (D) __Years__ 

                To the extent provided in regulations, this section shall be applied on the basis of any year specified in such regulations in lieu of plan years.

            (E) __Benefits not taken into account if employee not employed for last year before determination date__ 

                If any individual has not performed services for the employer maintaining the plan at any time during the 1-year period ending on the determination date, any accrued benefit for such individual (and the account of such individual) shall not be taken into account.

            (F) __Accrued benefits treated as accruing ratably__ 

            The accrued benefit of any employee (other than a key employee) shall be determined—

                (i) under the method which is used for accrual purposes for all plans of the employer, or

                (ii) if there is no method described in clause (i), as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under section 411(b)(1)(C).

            (G) __Simple retirement accounts__ 

                The term “top-heavy plan” shall not include a simple retirement account under section 408(p).

            (H) __Cash or deferred arrangements using alternative methods of meeting nondiscrimination requirements__ 

            The term “top-heavy plan” shall not include a plan which consists solely of—

                (i) a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of section 401(k)(12) or 401(k)(13), and

                (ii) matching contributions with respect to which the requirements of section 401(m)(11) or 401(m)(12) are met.

                If, but for this subparagraph, a plan would be treated as a top-heavy plan because it is a member of an aggregation group which is a top-heavy group, contributions under the plan may be taken into account in determining whether any other plan in the group meets the requirements of subsection (c)(2).
