    (a) __General rule__ 

    In the case of any organization to which this section applies—

    (b) __Amount of deduction__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the deduction determined under this subsection for any taxable year is the excess (if any) of—

            (A)

             25 percent of the sum of—

                (i) the claims incurred during the taxable year and liabilities incurred during the taxable year under cost-plus contracts, and

                (ii) the expenses incurred during the taxable year in connection with the administration, adjustment, or settlement of claims or in connection with the administration of cost-plus contracts, over

            (B) the adjusted surplus as of the beginning of the taxable year.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            The deduction determined under paragraph (1) for any taxable year shall not exceed taxable income for such taxable year (determined without regard to such deduction).

        (3) __Adjusted surplus__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The adjusted surplus as of the beginning of any taxable year is an amount equal to the adjusted surplus as of the beginning of the preceding taxable year—

                (i) increased by the amount of any adjusted taxable income for such preceding taxable year, or

                (ii) decreased by the amount of any adjusted net operating loss for such preceding taxable year.

            (B) __Special rule__ 

                The adjusted surplus as of the beginning of the organization’s 1st taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, shall be its surplus as of such time. For purposes of the preceding sentence and subsection (c)(3)(C), the term “surplus” means the excess of the total assets over total liabilities as shown on the annual statement.

            The term “net exempt income” means—

                (ii) the aggregate amount allowed as a deduction for the taxable year under sections 243, 244, and 245.

                The amount determined under clause (ii) shall be reduced by the amount of any decrease in deductions allowable for the taxable year by reason of section 832(b)(5)(B) to the extent such decrease is attributable to deductions under sections 243, 244, and 245.

        (4) __Only health-related items taken into account__ 

            Any determination under this subsection shall be made by only taking into account items attributable to the health-related business of the taxpayer.

                (v) at least 35 percent of its premiums are determined on a community rated basis, and
