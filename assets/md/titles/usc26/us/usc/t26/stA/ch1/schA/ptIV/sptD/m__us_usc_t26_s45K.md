## § 45K. Credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source

    (a) __Allowance of credit__ 

    For purposes of section 38, the nonconventional source production credit determined under this section for the taxable year is an amount equal to—

        (1) $3, multiplied by

        (2)

         the barrel-of-oil equivalent of qualified fuels—

            (A) sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year, and

            (B) the production of which is attributable to the taxpayer.

    (b) __Limitations and adjustments__ 

        (1) __Phaseout of credit__ 

        The amount of the credit allowable under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

            (A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds $23.50, bears to

            (B) $6.

        (2) __Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation__ 

            The $3 amount in subsection (a) and the $23.50 and $6 amounts in paragraph (1) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. In the case of gas from a tight formation, the $3 amount in subsection (a) shall not be adjusted.

        (3) __Credit reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, and subsidized energy financing__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The amount of the credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and a fraction—

                (i)

                 the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable year and all prior taxable years, of—

                    (I) grants provided by the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State for use in connection with the project,

                    (II) proceeds of any issue of State or local government obligations used to provide financing for the project the interest on which is exempt from tax under section 103, and

                    (III) the aggregate amount of subsidized energy financing (within the meaning of section 48(a)(4)(C)) provided in connection with the project, and

                (ii) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of additions to the capital account for the project for the taxable year and all prior taxable years.

            (B) __Amounts determined at close of year__ 

                The amounts under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall be determined as of the close of the taxable year.

        (4) __Credit reduced for energy credit__ 

        The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)) shall be reduced by the excess of—

            (A) the aggregate amount allowed under section 38 for the taxable year or any prior taxable year by reason of the energy percentage with respect to property used in the project, over

            (B)

             the aggregate amount recaptured with respect to the amount described in subparagraph (A)—

                (i) under section 49(b) or 50(a) for the taxable year or any prior taxable year, or

                (ii) under this paragraph for any prior taxable year.

            The amount recaptured under section 49(b) or 50(a) with respect to any property shall be appropriately reduced to take into account any reduction in the credit allowed by this section by reason of the preceding sentence.

        (5) __Credit reduced for enhanced oil recovery credit__ 

        The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after application of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4)) shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of—

            (A) the aggregate amount allowed under section 38 for the taxable year and any prior taxable year by reason of any enhanced oil recovery credit determined under section 43 with respect to such project, over

            (B) the aggregate amount recaptured with respect to the amount described in subparagraph (A) under this paragraph for any prior taxable year.

    (c) __Definition of qualified fuels__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified fuels” means—

            (A) oil produced from shale and tar sands,

            (B)

             gas produced from—

                (i) geopressured brine, Devonian shale, coal seams, or a tight formation, or

                (ii) biomass, and

            (C) liquid, gaseous, or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal (including lignite), including such fuels when used as feedstocks.

        (2) __Gas from geopressured brine, etc.__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the determination of whether any gas is produced from geopressured brine, Devonian shale, coal seams, or a tight formation shall be made in accordance with section 503 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (as in effect before the repeal of such section).

            (B) __Special rules for gas from tight formations__ 

            The term “gas produced from a tight formation” shall only include gas from a tight formation—

                (i) which, as of April 20, 1977, was committed or dedicated to interstate commerce (as defined in section 2(18) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as in effect on the date of the enactment of this clause), or

                (ii) which is produced from a well drilled after such date of enactment.

        (3) __Biomass__ 

        The term “biomass” means any organic material other than—

            (A) oil and natural gas (or any product thereof), and

            (B) coal (including lignite) or any product thereof.

    (d) __Other definitions and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Only production within the United States taken into account__ 

        Sales shall be taken into account under this section only with respect to qualified fuels the production of which is within—

            (A) the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), or

            (B) a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).

        (2) __Computation of inflation adjustment factor and reference price__

        (5) __Barrel-of-oil equivalent__ 

            The term “barrel-of-oil equivalent” with respect to any fuel means that amount of such fuel which has a Btu content of 5.8 million; except that in the case of qualified fuels described in subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(1), the Btu content shall be determined without regard to any material from a source not described in such subparagraph.

        (6) __Barrel defined__ 

            The term “barrel” means 42 United States gallons.

        (7) __Related persons__ 

            Persons shall be treated as related to each other if such persons would be treated as a single employer under the regulations prescribed under section 52(b). In the case of a corporation which is a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return, such corporation shall be treated as selling qualified fuels to an unrelated person if such fuels are sold to such a person by another member of such group.

                For purposes of applying subsection (b)(2) to the $3 amount in subsection (a), in the case of fuels sold after 2005, subsection (d)(2)(B) shall be applied by substituting “2004” for “1979”.

            (C) __Denial of double benefit__
