## § 1551. Disallowance of the benefits of the graduated corporate rates and accumulated earnings credit

    (a) __In general__ 

    If—

        (1) any corporation transfers, directly or indirectly, all or part of its property (other than money) to a transferee corporation, or

        (2) five or fewer individuals who are in control of a corporation transfer, directly or indirectly, property (other than money) to a transferee corporation,

        and the transferee corporation was created for the purpose of acquiring such property or was not actively engaged in business at the time of such acquisition, and if after such transfer the transferor or transferors are in control of such transferee corporation during any part of the taxable year of such transferee corporation, then for such taxable year of such transferee corporation the Secretary may (except as may be otherwise determined under subsection (c)) disallow the benefits of the rates contained in section 11(b) which are lower than the highest rate specified in such section, or the accumulated earnings credit provided in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 535(c), unless such transferee corporation shall establish by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of such benefits or credit was not a major purpose of such transfer.

    (b) __Control__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a), the term “control” means—

        (1) With respect to a transferee corporation described in subsection (a)(1), the ownership by the transferor corporation, its shareholders, or both, of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock; or

        (2)

         With respect to each corporation described in subsection (a)(2), the ownership by the five or fewer individuals described in such subsection of stock possessing—

            (A) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation, and

            (B) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such individual only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.

        For purposes of this subsection, section 1563(e) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock.

    (c) __Authority of the Secretary under this section__ 

        The provisions of section 269(c) and the authority of the Secretary under such section, shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, be applicable to this section.
