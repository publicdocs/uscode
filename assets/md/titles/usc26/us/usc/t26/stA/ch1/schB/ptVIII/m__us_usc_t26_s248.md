        (2) the remainder of such organizational expenditures shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over the 180-month period beginning with the month in which the corporation begins business.

    (b) __Organizational expenditures defined__ 

    The term “organizational expenditures” means any expenditure which—

        (1) is incident to the creation of the corporation;

        (2) is chargeable to capital account; and

        (3) is of a character which, if expended incident to the creation of a corporation having a limited life, would be amortizable over such life.
