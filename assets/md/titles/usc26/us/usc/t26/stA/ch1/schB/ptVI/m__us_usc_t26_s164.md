Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any tax (not described in the first sentence of this subsection) which is paid or accrued by the taxpayer in connection with an acquisition or disposition of property shall be treated as part of the cost of the acquired property or, in the case of a disposition, as a reduction in the amount realized on the disposition.

                (i) the tax imposed by section 2601, and

                (ii) any State tax described in section 2604,

                but only to the extent such tax is imposed on a transfer which is included in the gross income of the distributee and to which section 666 does not apply.

            (B) __Special rule for tax paid before due date__ 

                Any tax referred to in subparagraph (A) imposed with respect to a transfer occurring during the taxable year of the distributee (or, in the case of a taxable termination, the trust) which is paid not later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return with respect to such transfer shall be treated as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year in which the transfer was made.

                    (III) need only be determined with respect to adjusted gross incomes up to the applicable amount (as determined under section 68(b)).

            (C) __Income limitation__ 

            The amount otherwise taken into account under subparagraph (A) (after the application of subparagraph (B)) for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which is so treated as—

                 the excess (if any) of—

                    (I) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over

                    (II) $125,000 ($250,000 in the case of a joint return), bears to
