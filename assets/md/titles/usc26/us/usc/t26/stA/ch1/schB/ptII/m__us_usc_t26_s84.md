    (a) __General rule__ 

    If—

        (1) any person transfers property to a political organization, and

        (2) the fair market value of such property exceeds its adjusted basis,

    (b) __Basis of property__ 

        In the case of a transfer of property to a political organization to which subsection (a) applies, the basis of such property in the hands of the political organization shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased by the amount of gain recognized to the transferor by reason of such transfer.
