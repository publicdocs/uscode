## § 1400C. First-time homebuyer credit for District of Columbia

    (a) __Allowance of credit__ 

        In the case of an individual who is a first-time homebuyer of a principal residence in the District of Columbia during any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to so much of the purchase price of the residence as does not exceed $5,000.

    (b) __Limitation based on modified adjusted gross income__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) (determined without regard to this subsection and subsection (d)) for the taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount which bears the same ratio to the credit so allowable as—

            (A)

             the excess (if any) of—

                (i) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over

                (ii) $70,000 ($110,000 in the case of a joint return), bears to

            (B) $20,000.

        (2) __Modified adjusted gross income__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “modified adjusted gross income” means the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year increased by any amount excluded from gross income under section 911, 931, or 933.

    (c) __First-time homebuyer__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            The term “first-time homebuyer” means any individual if such individual (and if married, such individual’s spouse) had no present ownership interest in a principal residence in the District of Columbia during the 1-year period ending on the date of the purchase of the principal residence to which this section applies.

        (2) __One-time only__ 

            If an individual is treated as a first-time homebuyer with respect to any principal residence, such individual may not be treated as a first-time homebuyer with respect to any other principal residence.

        (3) __Principal residence__ 

            The term “principal residence” has the same meaning as when used in section 121.

    (d) __Carryforward of unused credit__ 

        If the credit allowable under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a) for such taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subpart A of part IV of subchapter A (other than this section and section 25D), such excess shall be carried to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a) for such taxable year.

    (e) __Special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Allocation of dollar limitation__ 

            (A) __Married individuals filing separately__ 

                In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, subsection (a) shall be applied by substituting “$2,500” for “$5,000”.

            (B) __Other taxpayers__ 

                If 2 or more individuals who are not married purchase a principal residence, the amount of the credit allowed under subsection (a) shall be allocated among such individuals in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, except that the total amount of the credits allowed to all such individuals shall not exceed $5,000.

        (2) __Purchase__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “purchase” means any acquisition, but only if—

                (i) the property is not acquired from a person whose relationship to the person acquiring it would result in the disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b) (but, in applying section 267(b) and (c) for purposes of this section, paragraph (4) of section 267(c) shall be treated as providing that the family of an individual shall include only his spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants), and

                (ii)

                 the basis of the property in the hands of the person acquiring it is not determined—

                    (I) in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the person from whom acquired, or

                    (II) under section 1014(a) (relating to property acquired from a decedent).

            (B) __Construction__ 

                A residence which is constructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by the taxpayer on the date the taxpayer first occupies such residence.

        (3) __Purchase price__ 

            The term “purchase price” means the adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date such residence is purchased.

        (4) __Coordination with national first-time homebuyers credit__ 

            No credit shall be allowed under this section to any taxpayer with respect to the purchase of a residence after December 31, 2008, if a credit under section 36 is allowable to such taxpayer (or the taxpayer’s spouse) with respect to such purchase.

    (f) __Reporting__ 

        If the Secretary requires information reporting under section 6045 by a person described in subsection (e)(2) thereof to verify the eligibility of taxpayers for the credit allowable by this section, the exception provided by section 6045(e)(5) shall not apply.

    (g) __Credit treated as nonrefundable personal credit__ 

        For purposes of this title, the credit allowed by this section shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of this chapter.

    (h) __Basis adjustment__ 

        For purposes of this subtitle, if a credit is allowed under this section with respect to the purchase of any residence, the basis of such residence shall be reduced by the amount of the credit so allowed.

    (i) __Application of section__ 

        This section shall apply to property purchased after August 4, 1997, and before January 1, 2012.
