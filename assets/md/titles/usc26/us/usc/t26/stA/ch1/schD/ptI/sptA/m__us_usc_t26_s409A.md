## § 409A. Inclusion in gross income of deferred compensation under nonqualified deferred compensation plans

    (a) __Rules relating to constructive receipt__ 

        (1) __Plan failures__ 

            (A) __Gross income inclusion__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If at any time during a taxable year a nonqualified deferred compensation plan—

                    (I) fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), or

                    (II) is not operated in accordance with such requirements,

                 all compensation deferred under the plan for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years shall be includible in gross income for the taxable year to the extent not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income.

                (ii) __Application only to affected participants__ 

                    Clause (i) shall only apply with respect to all compensation deferred under the plan for participants with respect to whom the failure relates.

            (B) __Interest and additional tax payable with respect to previously deferred compensation__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If compensation is required to be included in gross income under subparagraph (A) for a taxable year, the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year shall be increased by the sum of—

                    (I) the amount of interest determined under clause (ii), and

                    (II) an amount equal to 20 percent of the compensation which is required to be included in gross income.

                (ii) __Interest__ 

                    For purposes of clause (i), the interest determined under this clause for any taxable year is the amount of interest at the underpayment rate plus 1 percentage point on the underpayments that would have occurred had the deferred compensation been includible in gross income for the taxable year in which first deferred or, if later, the first taxable year in which such deferred compensation is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

        (2) __Distributions__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan provides that compensation deferred under the plan may not be distributed earlier than—

                (i) separation from service as determined by the Secretary (except as provided in subparagraph (B)(i)),

                (ii) the date the participant becomes disabled (within the meaning of subparagraph (C)),

                (iii) death,

                (iv) a specified time (or pursuant to a fixed schedule) specified under the plan at the date of the deferral of such compensation,

                (v) to the extent provided by the Secretary, a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, or

                (vi) the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency.

            (B) __Special rules__ 

                (i) __Specified employees__ 

                    In the case of any specified employee, the requirement of subparagraph (A)(i) is met only if distributions may not be made before the date which is 6 months after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the employee). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a specified employee is a key employee (as defined in section 416(i) without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) of a corporation any stock in which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise.

                (ii) __Unforeseeable emergency__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A)(vi)—

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        The term “unforeseeable emergency” means a severe financial hardship to the participant resulting from an illness or accident of the participant, the participant’s spouse, or a dependent (as defined in section 152(a)) of the participant, loss of the participant’s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant.

                    (II) __Limitation on distributions__ 

                        The requirement of subparagraph (A)(vi) is met only if, as determined under regulations of the Secretary, the amounts distributed with respect to an emergency do not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).

            (C) __Disabled__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), a participant shall be considered disabled if the participant—

                (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or

                (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the participant’s employer.

        (3) __Acceleration of benefits__ 

            The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan does not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment under the plan, except as provided in regulations by the Secretary.

        (4) __Elections__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The requirements of this paragraph are met if the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) are met.

            (B) __Initial deferral decision__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the plan provides that compensation for services performed during a taxable year may be deferred at the participant’s election only if the election to defer such compensation is made not later than the close of the preceding taxable year or at such other time as provided in regulations.

                (ii) __First year of eligibility__ 

                    In the case of the first year in which a participant becomes eligible to participate in the plan, such election may be made with respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election within 30 days after the date the participant becomes eligible to participate in such plan.

                (iii) __Performance-based compensation__ 

                    In the case of any performance-based compensation based on services performed over a period of at least 12 months, such election may be made no later than 6 months before the end of the period.

            (C) __Changes in time and form of distribution__ 

            The requirements of this subparagraph are met if, in the case of a plan which permits under a subsequent election a delay in a payment or a change in the form of payment—

                (i) the plan requires that such election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made,

                (ii) in the case of an election related to a payment not described in clause (ii), (iii), or (vi) of paragraph (2)(A), the plan requires that the payment with respect to which such election is made be deferred for a period of not less than 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made, and

                (iii) the plan requires that any election related to a payment described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv) may not be made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under such paragraph.

    (b) __Rules relating to funding__ 

        (1) __Offshore property in a trust__ 

        In the case of assets set aside (directly or indirectly) in a trust (or other arrangement determined by the Secretary) for purposes of paying deferred compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, for purposes of section 83 such assets shall be treated as property transferred in connection with the performance of services whether or not such assets are available to satisfy claims of general creditors—

            (A) at the time set aside if such assets (or such trust or other arrangement) are located outside of the United States, or

            (B) at the time transferred if such assets (or such trust or other arrangement) are subsequently transferred outside of the United States.

            This paragraph shall not apply to assets located in a foreign jurisdiction if substantially all of the services to which the nonqualified deferred compensation relates are performed in such jurisdiction.

        (2) __Employer’s financial health__ 

        In the case of compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, there is a transfer of property within the meaning of section 83 with respect to such compensation as of the earlier of—

            (B) the date on which assets are so restricted,

            whether or not such assets are available to satisfy claims of general creditors.

                (ii) a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of the plan sponsor or member of a controlled group which includes the plan sponsor provides that assets will become restricted to the provision of benefits under the plan to an applicable covered employee in connection with such restricted period (or other similar financial measure determined by the Secretary) with respect to the defined benefit plan, or assets are so restricted,

                such assets shall, for purposes of section 83, be treated as property transferred in connection with the performance of services whether or not such assets are available to satisfy claims of general creditors. Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any assets which are so set aside before the restricted period with respect to the defined benefit plan.

            (C) __Special rule for payment of taxes on deferred compensation included in income__ 

            If an employer provides directly or indirectly for the payment of any Federal, State, or local income taxes with respect to any compensation required to be included in gross income by reason of this paragraph—

                (i) interest shall be imposed under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i)(I) on the amount of such payment in the same manner as if such payment was part of the deferred compensation to which it relates,

                (ii) such payment shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the additional tax under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i)(II) in the same manner as if such payment was part of the deferred compensation to which it relates, and

                (iii) no deduction shall be allowed under this title with respect to such payment.

            (D) __Other definitions__

            For each taxable year that assets treated as transferred under this subsection remain set aside in a trust or other arrangement subject to paragraph (1), (2), or (3), any increase in value in, or earnings with respect to, such assets shall be treated as an additional transfer of property under this subsection (to the extent not previously included in income).

        (5) __Interest on tax liability payable with respect to transferred property__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If amounts are required to be included in gross income by reason of paragraph (1), (2), or (3) for a taxable year, the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by the sum of—

                (i) the amount of interest determined under subparagraph (B), and

                (ii) an amount equal to 20 percent of the amounts required to be included in gross income.

            (B) __Interest__
