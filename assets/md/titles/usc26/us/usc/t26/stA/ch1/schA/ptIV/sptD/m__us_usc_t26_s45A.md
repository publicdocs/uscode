            (B) __Coordination with work opportunity credit__ 

                The term “qualified wages” shall not include wages attributable to service rendered during the 1-year period beginning with the day the individual begins work for the employer if any portion of such wages is taken into account in determining the credit under section 51.

            (B) substantially all of the services performed during such period by such employee for such employer are performed within an Indian reservation, and

            (C) the principal place of abode of such employee while performing such services is on or near the reservation in which the services are performed.

        (2) __Individuals receiving wages in excess of $30,000 not eligible__

        (3) __Inflation adjustment__ 

            The Secretary shall adjust the $30,000 amount under paragraph (2) for years beginning after 1994 at the same time and in the same manner as under section 415(d), except that the base period taken into account for purposes of such adjustment shall be the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 1993.

        (4) __Employment must be trade or business employment__ 

            An employee shall be treated as a qualified employee for any taxable year of the employer only if more than 50 percent of the wages paid or incurred by the employer to such employee during such taxable year are for services performed in a trade or business of the employer.

        (6) __Indian tribe defined__ 

            The term “Indian tribe” means any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village, or regional or village corporation, as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ([43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

                (iii) a termination of employment of an individual if it is determined under the applicable State unemployment compensation law that the termination was due to the misconduct of such individual.

            (B) __Changes in form of business__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the employment relationship between the taxpayer and an employee shall not be treated as terminated—

                (i) by a transaction to which section 381(a) applies if the employee continues to be employed by the acquiring corporation, or

                (ii) by reason of a mere change in the form of conducting the trade or business of the taxpayer if the employee continues to be employed in such trade or business and the taxpayer retains a substantial interest in such trade or business.

        (4) __Special rule__ 

        Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as a tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of—
