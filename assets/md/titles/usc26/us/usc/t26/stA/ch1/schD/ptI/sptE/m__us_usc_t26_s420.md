## § 420. Transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts

    (a) __General rule__ 

    If there is a qualified transfer of any excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, which is part of such plan—

        (1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subsection (a) or (h) of section 401 solely by reason of such transfer (or any other action authorized under this section),

        (2) no amount shall be includible in the gross income of the employer maintaining the plan solely by reason of such transfer,

        (3)

         such transfer shall not be treated—

            (A) as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980, or

            (B) as a prohibited transaction for purposes of section 4975, and

        (4) the limitations of subsection (d) shall apply to such employer.

    (b) __Qualified transfer__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        The term “qualified transfer” means a transfer—

            (A) of excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, which is part of such plan,

            (B) which does not contravene any other provision of law, and

            (C)

             with respect to which the following requirements are met in connection with the plan—

                (i) the use requirements of subsection (c)(1),

                (ii) the vesting requirements of subsection (c)(2), and

                (iii) the minimum cost requirements of subsection (c)(3).

        (2) __Only 1 transfer per year__ 

            No more than 1 transfer with respect to any plan during a taxable year may be treated as a qualified transfer for purposes of this section. If there is a transfer from a defined benefit plan to both a health benefits account and an applicable life insurance account during any taxable year, such transfers shall be treated as 1 transfer for purposes of this paragraph.

        (3) __Limitation on amount transferred__ 

            The amount of excess pension assets which may be transferred to an account in a qualified transfer shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the taxable year of the transfer for qualified current retiree liabilities.

        (4) __Expiration__ 

            No transfer made after December 31, 2025, shall be treated as a qualified transfer.

    (c) __Requirements of plans transferring assets__ 

        (1) __Use of transferred assets__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay qualified current retiree liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under subsection (e)(1)(D))  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  for the taxable year of the transfer (whether directly or through reimbursement). In the case of a qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which subsection (f) applies, any assets so transferred may also be used to pay liabilities described in subsection (f)(2)(C).

            (B) __Amounts not used to pay for health benefits or life insurance__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (and any income allocable thereto) which are not used as provided in subparagraph (A) shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan.

                (ii) __Tax treatment of amounts__ 

                Any amount transferred out of an account under clause (i)—

                    (I) shall not be includible in the gross income of the employer for such taxable year, but

                    (II) shall be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980 (without regard to subsection (d) thereof).

            (C) __Ordering rule__ 

                For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, shall be treated as paid first out of the assets and income described in subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Requirements relating to pension benefits accruing before transfer__ 

            The requirements of this paragraph are met if the plan provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the transfer, immediately before such separation).

        (3) __Minimum cost requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The requirements of this paragraph are met if each group health plan or arrangement under which applicable health benefits are provided, and each group-term life insurance plan under which applicable life insurance benefits are provided, provides that the applicable employer cost for each taxable year during the cost maintenance period shall not be less than the higher of the applicable employer costs for each of the 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the qualified transfer or, in the case of a transfer which involves a plan maintained by an employer described in subsection (f)(2)(E)(i)(III), if the plan meets the requirements of subsection (f)(2)(D)(i)(II).

            (B) __Applicable employer cost__ 

            For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable employer cost” means, with respect to any taxable year, the amount determined by dividing—

                (i)

                 the qualified current retiree liabilities of the employer for such taxable year determined—

                    (I) separately with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits,

                    (II) without regard to any reduction under subsection (e)(1)(B), and

                    (III) in the case of a taxable year in which there was no qualified transfer, in the same manner as if there had been such a transfer at the end of the taxable year, by

                (ii) the number of individuals to whom coverage was provided during such taxable year for the benefits with respect to which the determination under clause (i) is made.

            (C) __Election to compute cost separately__ 

                An employer may elect to have this paragraph applied separately for applicable health benefits with respect to individuals eligible for benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals not so eligible, and separately for applicable life insurance benefits with respect to individuals age 65 or older at any time during the taxable year and with respect to individuals under age 65 during the taxable year.

            (D) __Cost maintenance period__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “cost maintenance period” means the period of 5 taxable years beginning with the taxable year in which the qualified transfer occurs. If a taxable year is in two or more overlapping cost maintenance periods, this paragraph shall be applied by taking into account the highest applicable employer cost required to be provided under subparagraph (A) for such taxable year.

            (E) __Regulations__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent an employer who significantly reduces retiree health coverage or retiree life insurance coverage, as the case may be, during the cost maintenance period from being treated as satisfying the minimum cost requirement of this subsection.

                (ii) __Insignificant cost reductions for retiree health coverage permitted__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        An eligible employer shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if, in lieu of any reduction of retiree health coverage permitted under the regulations prescribed under clause (i), the employer reduces applicable employer cost by an amount not in excess of the reduction in costs which would have occurred if the employer had made the maximum permissible reduction in retiree health coverage under such regulations. In applying such regulations to any subsequent taxable year, any reduction in applicable employer cost under this clause shall be treated as if it were an equivalent reduction in retiree health coverage.

                    (II) __Eligible employer__ 

                        For purposes of subclause (I), an employer shall be treated as an eligible employer for any taxable year if, for the preceding taxable year, the qualified current retiree liabilities of the employer with respect to applicable health benefits were at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer. For purposes of this subclause, the rules of paragraphs (2), (3)(B), and (3)(C) of section 448(c) shall apply in determining the amount of an employer’s gross receipts.

    (d) __Limitations on employer__ 

    For purposes of this title—

        (1) __Deduction limitations__ 

        No deduction shall be allowed—

            (A) for the transfer of any amount to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a qualified transfer (or any retransfer to the plan under subsection (c)(1)(B)),

            (B) for qualified current retiree liabilities paid out of the assets (and income) described in subsection (c)(1), or

            (C)

             for any amounts to which subparagraph (B) does not apply and which are paid for qualified current retiree liabilities for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are not greater than the excess (if any) of—

                (i) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) (and income allocable thereto), over

                (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B).

        (2) __No contributions allowed__ 

            An employer may not contribute any amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to qualified current retiree liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1).

    (e) __Definition and special rules__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Qualified current retiree liabilities__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “qualified current retiree liabilities” means, with respect to any taxable year, the aggregate amounts (including administrative expenses) which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer for such taxable year with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits provided during such taxable year if—

                (i) such benefits were provided directly by the employer, and

                (ii) the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.

                For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rule of section 419(c)(3)(B) shall apply.

            (B) __Reductions for amounts previously set aside__ 

            The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by the amount (determined separately for applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits) which bears the same ratio to such amount as—

                (i) the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the qualified transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts or applicable life insurance accounts or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the qualified current retiree liability, bears to

                (ii) the present value of the qualified current retiree liabilities for all plan years (determined without regard to this subparagraph).

            (C) __Applicable health benefits__ 

            The term “applicable health benefits” means health benefits or coverage which are provided to—

                (i) retired employees who, immediately before the qualified transfer, are entitled to receive such benefits by reason of retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, and

                (ii) their spouses and dependents.

            (D) __Applicable life insurance benefits__ 

                The term “applicable life insurance benefits” means group-term life insurance coverage provided to retired employees who, immediately before the qualified transfer, are entitled to receive such coverage by reason of retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, but only to the extent that such coverage is provided under a policy for retired employees and the cost of such coverage is excludable from the retired employee’s gross income under section 79.

            (E) __Key employees excluded__ 

                If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)) with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing qualified current retiree liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating applicable employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(B).

        (2) __Excess pension assets__ 

        The term “excess pension assets” means the excess (if any) of—

            (A)

             the lesser of—

                (i) the fair market value of the plan’s assets (reduced by the prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance determined under section 430(f)), or

                (ii) the value of plan assets as determined under section 430(g)(3) after reduction under section 430(f), over

            (B) 125 percent of the sum of the funding target and the target normal cost determined under section 430 for such plan year.

        (3) __Health benefits account__ 

            The term “health benefits account” means an account established and maintained under section 401(h).

        (4) __Applicable life insurance account__

        (5) __Coordination with sections 430 and 433__ 

            In the case of a qualified transfer, any assets so transferred shall not, for purposes of this section and sections 430 and 433, be treated as assets in the plan.

        (6) __Application to multiemployer plans__ 

        In the case of a multiemployer plan, this section shall be applied to any such plan—

            (A) by treating any reference in this section to an employer as a reference to all employers maintaining the plan (or, if appropriate, the plan sponsor), and

            (B) in accordance with such modifications of this section (and the provisions of this title relating to this section) as the Secretary determines appropriate to reflect the fact the plan is not maintained by a single employer.

    (f) __Qualified transfers to cover future retiree costs and collectively bargained retiree benefits__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        An employer maintaining a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) may, in lieu of a qualified transfer, elect for any taxable year to have the plan make—

            (A) a qualified future transfer, or

            (B) a collectively bargained transfer.

            Except as provided in this subsection, a qualified future transfer and a collectively bargained transfer shall be treated for purposes of this title and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as if it were a qualified transfer.

        (2) __Qualified future and collectively bargained transfers__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The terms “qualified future transfer” and “collectively bargained transfer” mean a transfer which meets all of the requirements for a qualified transfer, except that—

                (i) the determination of excess pension assets shall be made under subparagraph (B),

                (ii) the limitation on the amount transferred shall be determined under subparagraph (C),

                (iii) the minimum cost requirements of subsection (c)(3) shall be modified as provided under subparagraph (D), and

                (iv) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, the requirements of subparagraph (E) shall be met with respect to the transfer.

            (B) __Excess pension assets__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In determining excess pension assets for purposes of this subsection, subsection (e)(2) shall be applied by substituting “120 percent” for “125 percent”.

                (ii) __Requirement to maintain funded status__ 

                If, as of any valuation date of any plan year in the transfer period, the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(B) (after application of clause (i)) exceeds the amount determined under subsection (e)(2)(A), either—

                    (I) the employer maintaining the plan shall make contributions to the plan in an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date, or

                    (II) there is transferred from the health benefits account or applicable life insurance account, as the case may be, to the plan an amount not less than the amount required to reduce such excess to zero as of such date.

            (C) __Limitation on amount transferred__ 

            Notwithstanding subsection (b)(3), the amount of the excess pension assets which may be transferred—

                (i)

                 in the case of a qualified future transfer shall be equal to the sum of—

                    (I) if the transfer period includes the taxable year of the transfer, the amount determined under subsection (b)(3) for such taxable year, plus

                    (II) in the case of all other taxable years in the transfer period, the sum of the qualified current retiree liabilities which the plan reasonably estimates, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary, will be incurred for each of such years, and

                (ii) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, shall not exceed the amount which is reasonably estimated, in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and generally accepted accounting principles, to be the amount the employer maintaining the plan will pay (whether directly or through reimbursement) out of such account during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period for collectively bargained retiree liabilities.

            (D) __Minimum cost requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The requirements of subsection (c)(3) shall be treated as met if—

                    (I) in the case of a qualified future transfer, each group health plan or arrangement under which applicable health benefits are provided, and each group-term life insurance plan or arrangement under which applicable life insurance benefits are provided, provides applicable health benefits or applicable life insurance benefits, as the case may be, during the period beginning with the first year of the transfer period and ending with the last day of the 4th year following the transfer period such that the annual average amount of the applicable employer cost during such period is not less than the applicable employer cost determined under subsection (c)(3)(A) with respect to the transfer, and

                    (II) in the case of a collectively bargained transfer, each collectively bargained plan under which collectively bargained health benefits or collectively bargained life insurance benefits are provided provides that the collectively bargained employer cost for each taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period shall not be less than the amount specified by the collective bargaining agreement.

                (ii) __Election to maintain benefits for future transfers__ 

                    An employer may elect, in lieu of the requirements of clause (i)(I), to meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3) with respect to applicable health benefits or applicable life insurance benefits by meeting the requirements of such subsection (as in effect before the amendments made by section 535 of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999) for each of the years described in the period under clause (i)(I). Such election may be made separately with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits. In the case of an election with respect to applicable life insurance benefits, the first sentence of this clause shall be applied as if subsection (c)(3) as in effect before the amendments made by such Act applied to such benefits.

                (iii) __Collectively bargained employer cost__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “collectively bargained employer cost” means the average cost per covered individual of providing collectively bargained health benefits, collectively bargained life insurance benefits, or both, as the case may be, as determined in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Such agreement may provide for an appropriate reduction in the collectively bargained employer cost to take into account any portion of the collectively bargained health benefits, collectively bargained life insurance benefits, or both, as the case may be, that is provided or financed by a government program or other source.

            (E) __Special rules for collectively bargained transfers__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                A collectively bargained transfer shall only include a transfer which—

                    (I) is made in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement,

                    (II) before the transfer, the employer designates, in a written notice delivered to each employee organization that is a party to the collective bargaining agreement, as a collectively bargained transfer in accordance with this section, and

                    (III) involves a defined benefit plan maintained by an employer which, in its taxable year ending in 2005, provided health benefits or coverage to retirees and their spouses and dependents under all of the health benefit plans maintained by the employer, but only if the aggregate cost (including administrative expenses) of such benefits or coverage which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer (if such benefits or coverage had been provided directly by the employer and the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) is at least 5 percent of the gross receipts of the employer (determined in accordance with the last sentence of subsection (c)(3)(E)(ii)(II)) for such taxable year, or a plan maintained by a successor to such employer.

                (ii) __Use of assets__ 

                    Any assets transferred to a health benefits account, or an applicable life insurance account, in a collectively bargained transfer (and any income allocable thereto) shall be used only to pay collectively bargained retiree liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under paragraph (6)(B)(iii)) for the taxable year of the transfer or for any subsequent taxable year during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period (whether directly or through reimbursement).

        (3) __Coordination with other transfers__ 

            In applying subsection (b)(3) to any subsequent transfer during a taxable year in a transfer period or collectively bargained cost maintenance period, qualified current retiree liabilities shall be reduced by any such liabilities taken into account with respect to the qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer to which such period relates.

        (4) __Special deduction rules for collectively bargained transfers__ 

        In the case of a collectively bargained transfer—

            (A) the limitation under subsection (d)(1)(C) shall not apply, and

            (B) notwithstanding subsection (d)(2), an employer may contribute an amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) with respect to collectively bargained retiree liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used under subsection (c)(1)(B), and the deductibility of any such contribution shall be governed by the limits applicable to the deductibility of contributions to a welfare benefit fund under a collective bargaining agreement (as determined under section 419A(f)(5)(A)) without regard to whether such contributions are made to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund and without regard to the provisions of section 404 or the other provisions of this section.

            The Secretary shall provide rules to ensure that the application of this paragraph does not result in a deduction being allowed more than once for the same contribution or for 2 or more contributions or expenditures relating to the same collectively bargained retiree liabilities.

        (5) __Transfer period__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “transfer period” means, with respect to any transfer, a period of consecutive taxable years (not less than 2) specified in the election under paragraph (1) which begins and ends during the 10-taxable-year period beginning with the taxable year of the transfer.

        (6) __Terms relating to collectively bargained transfers__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Collectively bargained cost maintenance period__ 

            The term “collectively bargained cost maintenance period” means, with respect to each covered retiree and his covered spouse and dependents, the shorter of—

                (i) the remaining lifetime of such covered retiree and, in the case of a transfer to a health benefits account, his covered spouse and dependents, or

                (ii) the period of coverage provided by the collectively bargained plan (determined as of the date of the collectively bargained transfer) with respect to such covered retiree and, in the case of a transfer to a health benefits account, his covered spouse and dependents.

            (B) __Collectively bargained retiree liabilities__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    The term “collectively bargained retiree liabilities” means the present value, as of the beginning of a taxable year and determined in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement, of all collectively bargained health benefits, and collectively bargained life insurance benefits, (including administrative expenses) for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period.

                (ii) __Reduction for amounts previously set aside__ 

                    The amount determined under clause (i) shall be reduced by the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the collectively bargained transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts, applicable life insurance accounts, or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the collectively bargained retiree liabilities. The preceding sentence shall be applied separately for collectively bargained health benefits and collectively bargained life insurance benefits.

                (iii) __Key employees excluded__ 

                    If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)) with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing collectively bargained retiree liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating collectively bargained employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(C).

            (C) __Collectively bargained health benefits__ 

            The term “collectively bargained health benefits” means health benefits or coverage—

                (i) which are provided to retired employees who, immediately before the collectively bargained transfer, are entitled to receive such benefits by reason of retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, and their spouses and dependents, and

            (D) __Collectively bargained life insurance benefits__ 

            The term “collectively bargained life insurance benefits” means, with respect to any collectively bargained transfer—

                (i) applicable life insurance benefits which are provided to retired employees who, immediately before the transfer, are entitled to receive such benefits by reason of retirement, and

                (ii) if specified by the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement governing the transfer, applicable life insurance benefits which will be provided at retirement to employees who are not retired employees at the time of the transfer.

            (E) __Collectively bargained plan__ 

                The term “collectively bargained plan” means a group health plan or arrangement for retired employees and their spouses and dependents, or a group-term life insurance plan or arrangement for retired employees, that is maintained pursuant to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements.

    (g) __Segment rates determined without pension stabilization__
