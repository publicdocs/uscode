## § 382. Limitation on net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses following ownership change

    (a) __General rule__ 

        The amount of the taxable income of any new loss corporation for any post-change year which may be offset by pre-change losses shall not exceed the section 382 limitation for such year.

    (b) __Section 382 limitation__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as otherwise provided in this section, the section 382 limitation for any post-change year is an amount equal to—

            (A) the value of the old loss corporation, multiplied by

            (B) the long-term tax-exempt rate.

        (2) __Carryforward of unused limitation__ 

            If the section 382 limitation for any post-change year exceeds the taxable income of the new loss corporation for such year which was offset by pre-change losses, the section 382 limitation for the next post-change year shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

        (3) __Special rule for post-change year which includes change date__ 

        In the case of any post-change year which includes the change date—

            (A) __Limitation does not apply to taxable income before change__ 

                Subsection (a) shall not apply to the portion of the taxable income for such year which is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date. Except as provided in subsection (h)(5) and in regulations, taxable income shall be allocated ratably to each day in the year.

            (B) __Limitation for period after change__ 

            For purposes of applying the limitation of subsection (a) to the remainder of the taxable income for such year, the section 382 limitation shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to such limitation (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

                (i) the number of days in such year after the change date, bears to

                (ii) the total number of days in such year.

    (c) __Carryforwards disallowed if continuity of business requirements not met__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the new loss corporation does not continue the business enterprise of the old loss corporation at all times during the 2-year period beginning on the change date, the section 382 limitation for any post-change year shall be zero.

        (2) __Exception for certain gains__ 

        The section 382 limitation for any post-change year shall not be less than the sum of—

            (A)

             any increase in such limitation under—

                (i) subsection (h)(1)(A) for recognized built-in gains for such year, and

                (ii) subsection (h)(1)(C) for gain recognized by reason of an election under section 338, plus

            (B) any increase in such limitation under subsection (b)(2) for amounts described in subparagraph (A) which are carried forward to such year.

    (d) __Pre-change loss and post-change year__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Pre-change loss__ 

        The term “pre-change loss” means—

            (A) any net operating loss carryforward of the old loss corporation to the taxable year ending with the ownership change or in which the change date occurs, and

            (B) the net operating loss of the old loss corporation for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs to the extent such loss is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date.

            Except as provided in subsection (h)(5) and in regulations, the net operating loss shall, for purposes of subparagraph (B), be allocated ratably to each day in the year.

        (2) __Post-change year__ 

            The term “post-change year” means any taxable year ending after the change date.

    (e) __Value of old loss corporation__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__

        (2) __Special rule in the case of redemption or other corporate contraction__ 

            If a redemption or other corporate contraction occurs in connection with an ownership change, the value under paragraph (1) shall be determined after taking such redemption or other corporate contraction into account.

        (3) __Treatment of foreign corporations__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in regulations, in determining the value of any old loss corporation which is a foreign corporation, there shall be taken into account only items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

    (f) __Long-term tax-exempt rate__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

            The long-term tax-exempt rate shall be the highest of the adjusted Federal long-term rates in effect for any month in the 3-calendar-month period ending with the calendar month in which the change date occurs.

        (2) __Adjusted Federal long-term rate__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “adjusted Federal long-term rate” means the Federal long-term rate determined under section 1274(d), except that—

            (A) paragraphs (2) and (3) thereof shall not apply, and

            (B) such rate shall be properly adjusted for differences between rates on long-term taxable and tax-exempt obligations.

    (g) __Ownership change__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __In general__ 

        There is an ownership change if, immediately after any owner shift involving a 5-percent shareholder or any equity structure shift—

            (A) the percentage of the stock of the loss corporation owned by 1 or more 5-percent shareholders has increased by more than 50 percentage points, over

            (B) the lowest percentage of stock of the loss corporation (or any predecessor corporation) owned by such shareholders at any time during the testing period.

        (2) __Owner shift involving 5-percent shareholder__ 

        There is an owner shift involving a 5-percent shareholder if—

            (A) there is any change in the respective ownership of stock of a corporation, and

                Except as provided in subparagraphs (B)(i) and (C), in determining whether an ownership change has occurred, all stock owned by shareholders of a corporation who are not 5-percent shareholders of such corporation shall be treated as stock owned by 1 5-percent shareholder of such corporation.

            (B) __Coordination with equity structure shifts__ 

            For purposes of determining whether an equity structure shift (or subsequent transaction) is an ownership change—

                (i) __Less than 5-percent shareholders__ 

                    Subparagraph (A) shall be applied separately with respect to each group of shareholders (immediately before such equity structure shift) of each corporation which was a party to the reorganization involved in such equity structure shift.

                (ii) __Acquisitions of stock__ 

                    Unless a different proportion is established, acquisitions of stock after such equity structure shift shall be treated as being made proportionately from all shareholders immediately before such acquisition.

            (C) __Coordination with other owner shifts__ 

                Except as provided in regulations, rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) shall apply in determining whether there has been an owner shift involving a 5-percent shareholder and whether such shift (or subsequent transaction) results in an ownership change.

            (D) __Treatment of worthless stock__ 

            If any stock held by a 50-percent shareholder is treated by such shareholder as becoming worthless during any taxable year of such shareholder and such stock is held by such shareholder as of the close of such taxable year, for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs after the close of such taxable year, such shareholder—

                (i) shall be treated as having acquired such stock on the 1st day of his 1st succeeding taxable year, and

                (ii) shall not be treated as having owned such stock during any prior period.

                For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “50-percent shareholder” means any person owning 50 percent or more of the stock of the corporation at any time during the 3-year period ending on the last day of the taxable year with respect to which the stock was so treated.

            (C) __Adjustments__ 

                The amount of the net unrealized built-in gain or loss shall be properly adjusted for amounts which would be treated as recognized built-in gains or losses under this paragraph if such amounts were properly taken into account (or allowable as a deduction) during the recognition period.

>         “(1) The delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 382(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not authorize the Secretary to provide exemptions or special rules that are restricted to particular industries or classes of taxpayers.

>         “(2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 is inconsistent with the congressional intent in enacting such section 382(m).

>         “(3) The legal authority to prescribe Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 is doubtful.

>         “(4) However, as taxpayers should generally be able to rely on guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury legislation is necessary to clarify the force and effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 and restore the proper application under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the limitation on built-in losses following an ownership change of a bank.
