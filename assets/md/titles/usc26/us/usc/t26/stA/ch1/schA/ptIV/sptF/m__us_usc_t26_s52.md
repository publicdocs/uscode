        (2) the credit (if any) determined under section 51(a) with respect to each trade or business shall be its proportionate share of the wages giving rise to such credit.

        The regulations prescribed under this subsection shall be based on principles similar to the principles which apply in the case of subsection (a).

    (c) __Tax-exempt organizations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            No credit shall be allowed under section 38 for any work opportunity credit determined under this subpart to any organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from income tax under this chapter.

        (2) __Credit made available to qualified tax-exempt organizations employing qualified veterans__ 

            For credit against payroll taxes for employment of qualified veterans by qualified tax-exempt organizations, see section 3111(e).

    (d) __Estates and trusts__ 

    In the case of an estate or trust—

        (1) the amount of the credit determined under this subpart for any taxable year shall be apportioned between the estate or trust and the beneficiaries on the basis of the income of the estate or trust allocable to each, and

        (2) any beneficiary to whom any amount has been apportioned under paragraph (1) shall be allowed, subject to section 38(c), a credit under section 38(a) for such amount.

    (e) __Limitations with respect to certain persons__ 

    Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in the case of—

        (1) a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust subject to taxation under subchapter M (section 851 and following), and

        (2) a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a),

        rules similar to the rules provided in subsections (e) and (h) of section 46 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) shall apply in determining the amount of the credit under this subpart.
