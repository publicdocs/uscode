        (1) __Distributee taxable under section 72__ 

            If an annuity contract is purchased by an employer for an employee under a plan which meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) (whether or not the employer deducts the amounts paid for the contract under such section), the amount actually distributed to any distributee under the contract shall be taxable to the distributee (in the year in which so distributed) under section 72 (relating to annuities).

        (2) __Special rule for health and long-term care insurance__ 

            To the extent provided in section 402(l), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount distributed under the contract which is otherwise includible in gross income under this subsection.

        (3) __Self-employed individuals__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the term “employee” includes an individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), and the employer of such individual is the person treated as his employer under section 401(c)(4).

        (4) __Rollover amounts__ 

            (A) __General rule__ 

            If—

                (i) any portion of the balance to the credit of an employee in an employee annuity described in paragraph (1) is paid to him in an eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 402(c)(4)),

                (ii) the employee transfers any portion of the property he receives in such distribution to an eligible retirement plan, and

                (iii) in the case of a distribution of property other than money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed,

                then such distribution (to the extent so transferred) shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year in which paid.

            (B) __Certain rules made applicable__ 

                The rules of paragraphs (2) through (7) and (11) and (9) of section 402(c) and section 402(f) shall apply for purposes of subparagraph (A).

        (5) __Direct trustee-to-trustee transfer__ 

            Any amount transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer in accordance with section 401(a)(31) shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year of such transfer.

    (b) __Taxability of beneficiary under annuity purchased by section 501(c)(3) organization or public school__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        If—

            (A)

             an annuity contract is purchased—

                (i) for an employee by an employer described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a),

                (ii) for an employee (other than an employee described in clause (i)), who performs services for an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1) (A)(ii), by an employer which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or

                (iii) for the minister described in section 414(e)(5)(A) by the minister or by an employer,

            (B) such annuity contract is not subject to subsection (a),

            (C) the employee’s rights under the contract are nonforfeitable, except for failure to pay future premiums,

            (D) except in the case of a contract purchased by a church, such contract is purchased under a plan which meets the nondiscrimination requirements of paragraph (12), and

            (E) in the case of a contract purchased under a salary reduction agreement, the contract meets the requirements of section 401(a)(30),

            then contributions and other additions by such employer for such annuity contract shall be excluded from the gross income of the employee for the taxable year to the extent that the aggregate of such contributions and additions (when expressed as an annual addition (within the meaning of section 415(c)(2))) does not exceed the applicable limit under section 415. The amount actually distributed to any distributee under such contract shall be taxable to the distributee (in the year in which so distributed) under section 72 (relating to annuities). For purposes of applying the rules of this subsection to contributions and other additions by an employer for a taxable year, amounts transferred to a contract described in this paragraph by reason of a rollover contribution described in paragraph (8) of this subsection or section 408(d)(3)(A)(ii) shall not be considered contributed by such employer.

Such term does not include any amount contributed by the employer for any annuity contract to which this subsection applies. Such term includes—

            (A) any elective deferral (as defined in section 402(g)(3)), and

            (B) any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the employee and which is not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of section 125, 132(f)(4), or 457.

        (4) __Years of service__ 

        In determining the number of years of service for purposes of this subsection, there shall be included—

            (A) one year for each full year during which the individual was a full-time employee of the organization purchasing the annuity for him, and

            (B) a fraction of a year (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for each full year during which such individual was a part-time employee of such organization and for each part of a year during which such individual was a full-time or part-time employee of such organization.

            In no case shall the number of years of service be less than one.

        (5) __Application to more than one annuity contract__ 

            If for any taxable year of the employee this subsection applies to 2 or more annuity contracts purchased by the employer, such contracts shall be treated as one contract.

        (12) __Nondiscrimination requirements__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1)(D), a plan meets the nondiscrimination requirements of this paragraph if—
