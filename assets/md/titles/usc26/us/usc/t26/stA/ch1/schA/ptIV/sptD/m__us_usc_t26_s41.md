                (ii) the credit (if any) allowable by this section to each such person shall be determined on a proportionate basis to its share of the aggregate of the qualified research expenses, basic research payments, and amounts paid or incurred to energy research consortiums, taken into account by all such persons under common control for purposes of this section.

                The regulations prescribed under this subparagraph shall be based on principles similar to the principles which apply in the case of subparagraph (A).

        (2) __Allocations__

                    If a person acquires the major portion of either a trade or business or a separate unit of a trade or business (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “acquired business”) of another person (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “predecessor”), then the amount of qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the acquiring person during the measurement period shall be increased by the amount determined under clause (ii), and the gross receipts of the acquiring person for such period shall be increased by the amount determined under clause (iii).

                (ii) __Amount determined with respect to qualified research expenses__ 

                The amount determined under this clause is—

                    (I) for purposes of applying this section for the taxable year in which such acquisition is made, the acquisition year amount, and

                    (II) for purposes of applying this section for any taxable year after the taxable year in which such acquisition is made, the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor with respect to the acquired business during the measurement period.

                (iii) __Amount determined with respect to gross receipts__ 

                    The amount determined under this clause is the amount which would be determined under clause (ii) if “the gross receipts of” were substituted for “the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by” each place it appears in clauses (ii) and (iv).

                (iv) __Acquisition year amount__ 

                For purposes of clause (ii), the acquisition year amount is the amount equal to the product of—

                    (I) the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor with respect to the acquired business during the measurement period, and

                    (II) the number of days in the period beginning on the date of the acquisition and ending on the last day of the taxable year in which the acquisition is made,

                 divided by the number of days in the acquiring person’s taxable year.

                (v) __Special rules for coordinating taxable years__ 

                In the case of an acquiring person and a predecessor whose taxable years do not begin on the same date—

                    (I) each reference to a taxable year in clauses (ii) and (iv) shall refer to the appropriate taxable year of the acquiring person,

                    (II) the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor, and the gross receipts of the predecessor, during each taxable year of the predecessor any portion of which is part of the measurement period shall be allocated equally among the days of such taxable year,

                    (III) the amount of such qualified research expenses taken into account under clauses (ii) and (iv) with respect to a taxable year of the acquiring person shall be equal to the total of the expenses attributable under subclause (II) to the days occurring during such taxable year, and

                    (IV) the amount of such gross receipts taken into account under clause (iii) with respect to a taxable year of the acquiring person shall be equal to the total of the gross receipts attributable under subclause (II) to the days occurring during such taxable year.

                (vi) __Measurement period__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “measurement period” means, with respect to the taxable year of the acquiring person for which the credit is determined, any period of the acquiring person preceding such taxable year which is taken into account for purposes of determining the credit for such year.

            (B) __Dispositions__ 

            If the predecessor furnished to the acquiring person such information as is necessary for the application of subparagraph (A), then, for purposes of applying this section for any taxable year ending after such disposition, the amount of qualified research expenses paid or incurred by, and the gross receipts of, the predecessor during the measurement period (as defined in subparagraph (A)(vi), determined by substituting “predecessor” for “acquiring person” each place it appears) shall be reduced by—

                (i)

                 in the case of the taxable year in which such disposition is made, an amount equal to the product of—

                    (I) the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by, or gross receipts of, the predecessor with respect to the acquired business during the measurement period (as so defined and so determined), and

                    (II) the number of days in the period beginning on the date of acquisition (as determined for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv)(II)) and ending on the last day of the taxable year of the predecessor in which the disposition is made,

                 divided by the number of days in the taxable year of the predecessor, and

                (ii) in the case of any taxable year ending after the taxable year in which such disposition is made, the amount described in clause (i)(I).

            (C) __Certain reimbursements taken into account in determining fixed-base percentage__ 

            If during any of the 3 taxable years following the taxable year in which a disposition to which subparagraph (B) applies occurs, the disposing taxpayer (or a person with whom the taxpayer is required to aggregate expenditures under paragraph (1)) reimburses the acquiring person (or a person required to so aggregate expenditures with such person) for research on behalf of the taxpayer, then the amount of qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the taxable years taken into account in computing the fixed-base percentage shall be increased by the lesser of—

                (i) the amount of the decrease under subparagraph (B) which is allocable to taxable years so taken into account, or

                (ii) the product of the number of taxable years so taken into account, multiplied by the amount of the reimbursement described in this subparagraph.

        (4) __Short taxable years__ 

            In the case of any short taxable year, qualified research expenses and gross receipts shall be annualized in such circumstances and under such methods as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.

        (5) __Controlled group of corporations__ 

        The term “controlled group of corporations” has the same meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that—

            (A) “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1), and

            (B) the determination shall be made without regard to subsections (a)(4) and (e)(3)(C) of section 1563.

                (iv) to which no single person paid or incurred (including as contributions) during such calendar year an amount equal to more than 50 percent of the total amounts received by such organization during such calendar year for energy research.

            (B) __Treatment of persons__
