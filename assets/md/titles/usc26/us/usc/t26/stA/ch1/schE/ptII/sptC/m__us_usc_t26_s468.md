        (1) __Allowance of deduction__ 

        If a taxpayer elects the application of this section with respect to any mining or solid waste disposal property, the amount of any deduction for qualified reclamation or closing costs for any taxable year to which such election applies shall be equal to the current reclamation or closing costs allocable to—

            (A) in the case of qualified reclamation costs, the portion of the reserve property which was disturbed during such taxable year, and

            (B) in the case of qualified closing costs, the production from the reserve property during such taxable year.

        (2) __Opening balance and adjustments to reserve__ 

            (A) __Opening balance__ 

                The opening balance of any reserve for its first taxable year shall be zero.

            (B) __Increase for interest__ 

            A reserve shall be increased each taxable year by an amount equal to the amount of interest which would have been earned during such taxable year on the opening balance of such reserve for such taxable year if such interest were computed—

                (i) at the Federal short-term rate or rates (determined under section 1274) in effect, and

                (ii) by compounding semiannually.

            (C) __Reserve to be charged for amounts paid__ 

                Any amount paid by the taxpayer during any taxable year for qualified reclamation or closing costs allocable to portions of the reserve property for which the election under paragraph (1) was in effect shall be charged to the appropriate reserve as of the close of the taxable year.

                A reserve shall be increased each taxable year by the amount allowable as a deduction under paragraph (1) for such taxable year which is allocable to such reserve.

        (3) __Allowance of deduction for excess amounts paid__ 

        There shall be allowed as a deduction for any taxable year the excess of—

            (A) the amounts described in paragraph (2)(C) paid during such taxable year, over

            (B) the closing balance of the reserve for such taxable year (determined without regard to paragraph (2)(C)).

        (4) __Limitation on balance as of the close of any taxable year__ 

            (A) __Reclamation reserves__ 

            In the case of any reserve for qualified reclamation costs, there shall be included in gross income for any taxable year an amount equal to the excess of—

                (i) the closing balance of the reserve for such taxable year, over

                (ii) the current reclamation costs of the taxpayer for all portions of the reserve property disturbed during any taxable year to which the election under paragraph (1) applies.

            (B) __Closing costs reserves__ 

            In the case of any reserve for qualified closing costs, there shall be included in gross income for any taxable year an amount equal to the excess of—

                (i) the closing balance of the reserve for such taxable year, over

                (ii) the current closing cost of the taxpayer with respect to the reserve property, determined as if all production with respect to the reserve property for any taxable year to which the election under paragraph (1) applies had occurred in such taxable year.

            (C) __Order of application__ 

                This paragraph shall be applied after all adjustments to the reserve have been made for the taxable year.

        (5) __Income inclusions on completion or disposition__ 

        Proper inclusion in income shall be made upon—

            (B) completion of the closing, or disposition of any portion, of a reserve property.

    (b) __Allocation for property where election not in effect for all taxable years__ 

        If the election under subsection (a)(1) is not in effect for 1 or more taxable years in which the reserved property is disturbed (or production occurs), items with respect to the reserve property shall be allocated to the reserve in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.

    (c) __Revocation of election; separate reserves__
