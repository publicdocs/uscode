## § 447. Method of accounting for corporations engaged in farming

    (a) __General rule__ 

    Except as otherwise provided by law, the taxable income from farming of—

        (1) a corporation engaged in the trade or business of farming, or

        (2) a partnership engaged in the trade or business of farming, if a corporation is a partner in such partnership,

        shall be computed on an accrual method of accounting. This section shall not apply to the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm or to the raising or harvesting of trees (other than fruit and nut trees).

    (b) __Preproductive period expenses__ 

        For rules requiring capitalization of certain preproductive period expenses, see section 263A.

    (c) __Exception for certain corporations__ 

    For purposes of subsection (a), a corporation shall be treated as not being a corporation if it is—

        (1) an S corporation, or

        (2) a corporation the gross receipts of which meet the requirements of subsection (d).

    (d) __Gross receipts requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A corporation meets the requirements of this subsection if, for each prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, such corporation (and any predecessor corporation) did not have gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of the preceding sentence, all corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as 1 corporation.

        (2) __Special rules for family corporations__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In the case of a family corporation, paragraph (1) shall be applied—

                (i) by substituting “December 31, 1985,” for “December 31, 1975,”; and

                (ii) by substituting “$25,000,000” for “$1,000,000”.

            (B) __Gross receipts test__ 

                (i) __Controlled groups__ 

                Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), in the case of a family corporation—

                    (I) except as provided by the Secretary, only the applicable percentage of gross receipts of any other member of any controlled group of corporations of which such corporation is a member shall be taken into account, and

                    (II) under regulations, gross receipts of such corporation or of another member of such group shall not be taken into account by such corporation more than once.

                (ii) __Pass-thru entities__ 

                    For purposes of paragraph (1), if a family corporation holds directly or indirectly any interest in a partnership, estate, trust or other pass-thru entity, such corporation shall take into account its proportionate share of the gross receipts of such entity.

                (iii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of clause (i), the term “applicable percentage” means the percentage equal to a fraction—

                    (I) the numerator of which is the fair market value of the stock of another corporation held directly or indirectly as of the close of the taxable year by the family corporation, and

                    (II) the denominator of which is the fair market value of all stock of such corporation as of such time.

                 For purposes of this clause, the term “stock” does not include stock described in section 1563(c)(1).

            (C) __Family corporation__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “family corporation” means—

                (i) any corporation if at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, and at least 50 percent of all other classes of stock of the corporation, are owned by members of the same family, and

                (ii) any corporation described in subsection (h).

    (e) __Members of the same family__ 

    For purposes of subsection (d)—

        (1) the members of the same family are an individual, such individual’s brothers and sisters, the brothers and sisters of such individual’s parents and grandparents, the ancestors and lineal descendants or any of the foregoing, a spouse of any of the foregoing, and the estate of any of the foregoing,

        (2) stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partnership or trust shall be treated as owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries, and

        (3) if 50 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as “first corporation”) is owned, directly or through paragraph (2), by or for members of the same family, such members shall be considered as owning each class of stock in a second corporation (or a wholly owned subsidiary of such second corporation) owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the first corporation, in that proportion which the value of the stock in the first corporation which such members so own bears to the value of all the stock in the first corporation.

        For purposes of paragraph (1), individuals related by the half blood or by legal adoption shall be treated as if they were related by the whole blood.

    (f) __Coordination with section 481__ 

    In the case of any taxpayer required by this section to change its method of accounting for any taxable year—

        (1) such change shall be treated as having been made with the consent of the Secretary,

        (2) for purposes of section 481(a)(2), such change shall be treated as a change not initiated by the taxpayer, and

        (3) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the net amount of adjustments required by section 481(a) to be taken into account by the taxpayer in computing taxable income shall be taken into account in each of the 10 taxable years (or the remaining taxable years where there is a stated future life of less than 10 taxable years) beginning with the year of change.

    (g) __Certain annual accrual accounting methods__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Notwithstanding subsection (a) or section 263A, if—

            (A) for its 10 taxable years ending with its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, a corporation or qualified partnership used an annual accrual method of accounting with respect to its trade or business of farming,

            (B) such corporation or qualified partnership raises crops which are harvested not less than 12 months after planting, and

            (C) such corporation or qualified partnership has used such method of accounting for all taxable years intervening between its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, and the taxable year,

            such corporation or qualified partnership may continue to employ such method of accounting for the taxable year with respect to its qualified farming trade or business.

        (2) __Annual accrual method of accounting defined__ 

            For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “annual accrual method of accounting” means a method under which revenues, costs, and expenses are computed on an accrual method of accounting and the preproductive period expenses incurred during the taxable year are charged to harvested crops or deducted in determining the taxable income for such years.

        (3) __Certain nonrecognition transfers__ 

        For purposes of this subsection, if—

            (A) a corporation acquired substantially all the assets of a qualified farming trade or business from another corporation in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized to the transferor or transferee corporation, or

            (B) a qualified partnership acquired substantially all the assets of a qualified farming trade or business from one of its partners in a transaction to which section 721 applies,

            the transferee corporation or qualified partnership shall be deemed to have computed its taxable income on an annual accrual method of accounting during the period for which the transferor corporation or partnership computed its taxable income from such trade or business on an annual accrual method.

        (4) __Qualified partnership defined__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __Qualified partnership__ 

            The term “qualified partnership” means a partnership which is engaged in a qualified farming trade or business and each of the partners of which is a corporation other than—

                (i) an S corporation, or

                (ii) a personal holding company (within the meaning of section 542(a)).

            (B) __Qualified farming trade or business__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The term “qualified farming trade or business” means the trade or business of farming—

                    (II) any plant with a preproductive period (as defined in section 263A(e)(3)) of 2 years or less, and

                    (III) any other plant (other than any citrus or almond tree) if an election by the corporation under this subparagraph is in effect.

                 In the case of a partnership and for purposes of paragraph (3)(A), subclauses (II) and (III) shall not apply.

                (ii) __Effect of election__ 

                    For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 263A(e), any election under this subparagraph shall be treated as if it were an election under subsection (d)(3) of section 263A.

                (iii) __Election__ 

                    Unless the Secretary otherwise consents, an election under this subparagraph may be made only for the corporation’s 1st taxable year which begins after December 31, 1986, and during which the corporation engages in a farming business. Any such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

    (h) __Exception for certain closely held corporations__

            (B)

                (i) members of 3 families (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1)) have owned (directly or through the application of subsection (e)) at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote, and at least 50 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of such corporation; and

                (ii)

                 substantially all of the stock of such corporation which is not so owned (directly or through the application of subsection (e)) by members of such 3 families is owned directly—

                    (I) by employees of the corporation or members of their families (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)), or

                    (II) by a trust for the benefit of the employees of such corporation which is described in section 401(a) and which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a).

        (2) __Stock held by employees, etc.__

        (2) __Initial opening balance__ 

        The initial opening balance of the account described in paragraph (1) shall be the lesser of—
