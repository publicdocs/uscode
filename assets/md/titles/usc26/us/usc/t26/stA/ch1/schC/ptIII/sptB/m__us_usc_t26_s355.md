## § 355. Distribution of stock and securities of a controlled corporation

    (a) __Effect on distributees__ 

        (1) __General rule__ 

        If—

            (A)

             a corporation (referred to in this section as the “distributing corporation”)—

                (i) distributes to a shareholder, with respect to its stock, or

                (ii) distributes to a security holder, in exchange for its securities,

                solely stock or securities of a corporation (referred to in this section as “controlled corporation”) which it controls immediately before the distribution,

            (B) the transaction was not used principally as a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation or both (but the mere fact that subsequent to the distribution stock or securities in one or more of such corporations are sold or exchanged by all or some of the distributees (other than pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or agreed upon prior to such distribution) shall not be construed to mean that the transaction was used principally as such a device),

            (C) the requirements of subsection (b) (relating to active businesses) are satisfied, and

            (D)

             as part of the distribution, the distributing corporation distributes—

                (i) all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation held by it immediately before the distribution, or

                (ii) an amount of stock in the controlled corporation constituting control within the meaning of section 368(c), and it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the retention by the distributing corporation of stock (or stock and securities) in the controlled corporation was not in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax,

            then no gain or loss shall be recognized to (and no amount shall be includible in the income of) such shareholder or security holder on the receipt of such stock or securities.

        (2) __Non pro rata distributions, etc.__ 

        Paragraph (1) shall be applied without regard to the following:

            (A) whether or not the distribution is pro rata with respect to all of the shareholders of the distributing corporation,

            (B) whether or not the shareholder surrenders stock in the distributing corporation, and

            (C) whether or not the distribution is in pursuance of a plan of reorganization (within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D)).

        (3) __Limitations__ 

            (A) __Excess principal amount__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply if—

                (i) the principal amount of the securities in the controlled corporation which are received exceeds the principal amount of the securities which are surrendered in connection with such distribution, or

                (ii) securities in the controlled corporation are received and no securities are surrendered in connection with such distribution.

            (B) __Stock acquired in taxable transactions within 5 years treated as boot__ 

            For purposes of this section (other than paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection) and so much of section 356 as relates to this section, stock of a controlled corporation acquired by the distributing corporation by reason of any transaction—

                (i) which occurs within 5 years of the distribution of such stock, and

                (ii) in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part,

                shall not be treated as stock of such controlled corporation, but as other property.

            (C) __Property attributable to accrued interest__ 

                Neither paragraph (1) nor so much of section 356 as relates to paragraph (1) shall apply to the extent that any stock (including nonqualified preferred stock, as defined in section 351(g)(2)), securities, or other property received is attributable to interest which has accrued on securities on or after the beginning of the holder’s holding period.

            (D) __Nonqualified preferred stock__ 

                Nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(2)) received in a distribution with respect to stock other than nonqualified preferred stock (as so defined) shall not be treated as stock or securities.

        (4) __Cross references__ 

            (A) For treatment of the exchange if any property is received which is not permitted to be received under this subsection (including nonqualified preferred stock and an excess principal amount of securities received over securities surrendered, but not including property to which paragraph (3)(C) applies), see section 356.

            (B) For treatment of accrued interest in the case of an exchange described in paragraph (3)(C), see section 61.

    (b) __Requirements as to active business__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Subsection (a) shall apply only if either—

            (A) the distributing corporation, and the controlled corporation (or, if stock of more than one controlled corporation is distributed, each of such corporations), is engaged immediately after the distribution in the active conduct of a trade or business, or

            (B) immediately before the distribution, the distributing corporation had no assets other than stock or securities in the controlled corporations and each of the controlled corporations is engaged immediately after the distribution in the active conduct of a trade or business.

        (2) __Definition__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (1), a corporation shall be treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business if and only if—

            (A) it is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business,

            (B) such trade or business has been actively conducted throughout the 5-year period ending on the date of the distribution,

            (C) such trade or business was not acquired within the period described in subparagraph (B) in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part, and

            (D)

             control of a corporation which (at the time of acquisition of control) was conducting such trade or business—

                (i) was not acquired by any distributee corporation directly (or through 1 or more corporations, whether through the distributing corporation or otherwise) within the period described in subparagraph (B) and was not acquired by the distributing corporation directly (or through 1 or more corporations) within such period, or

                (ii) was so acquired by any such corporation within such period, but, in each case in which such control was so acquired, it was so acquired, only by reason of transactions in which gain or loss was not recognized in whole or in part, or only by reason of such transactions combined with acquisitions before the beginning of such period.

                For purposes of subparagraph (D), all distributee corporations which are members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to section 1504(b)) shall be treated as 1 distributee corporation.

            (C) __Treatment of trade or business conducted by acquired member__ 

                If a corporation became a member of a separate affiliated group as a result of one or more transactions in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part, any trade or business conducted by such corporation (at the time that such corporation became such a member) shall be treated for purposes of paragraph (2) as acquired in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part.

            (B) __Qualified property__ 

                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “qualified property” means any stock or securities in the controlled corporation.

            Sections 311 and 336(a) shall not apply to any distribution referred to in paragraph (1).
