## § 48B. Qualifying gasification project credit

    (a) __In general__ 

        For purposes of section 46, the qualifying gasification project credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to 20 percent (30 percent in the case of credits allocated under subsection (d)(1)(B)) of the qualified investment for such taxable year.

    (b) __Qualified investment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of subsection (a), the qualified investment for any taxable year is the basis of eligible property placed in service by the taxpayer during such taxable year which is part of a qualifying gasification project—

            (A)

                (i) the construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the taxpayer, or

                (ii) which is acquired by the taxpayer if the original use of such property commences with the taxpayer, and

            (B) with respect to which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable.

        (2) __Special rule for certain subsidized property__ 

            Rules similar to section 48(a)(4) (without regard to subparagraph (D) thereof) shall apply for purposes of this section.

            (B) will be carried out by an eligible entity, and

            (C) any portion of the qualified investment of which is certified under the qualifying gasification program as eligible for credit under this section in an amount (not to exceed $650,000,000) determined by the Secretary.

        (2) __Gasification technology__ 

            The term “gasification technology” means any process which converts a solid or liquid product from coal, petroleum residue, biomass, or other materials which are recovered for their energy or feedstock value into a synthesis gas composed primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for direct use or subsequent chemical or physical conversion.

        (3) __Eligible property__ 

            The term “eligible property” means any property which is a part of a qualifying gasification project and is necessary for the gasification technology of such project.

        (4) __Biomass__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “biomass” means any—

                (i) agricultural or plant waste,

                (ii) byproduct of wood or paper mill operations, including lignin in spent pulping liquors, and

                (iii) other products of forestry maintenance.

            (B) __Exclusion__ 

                The term “biomass” does not include paper which is commonly recycled.

        (5) __Carbon capture capability__ 

            The term “carbon capture capability” means a gasification plant design which is determined by the Secretary to reflect reasonable consideration for, and be capable of, accommodating the equipment likely to be necessary to capture carbon dioxide from the gaseous stream, for later use or sequestration, which would otherwise be emitted in the flue gas from a project which uses a nonrenewable fuel.

        (6) __Coal__ 

            The term “coal” means anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, and peat.

        (7) __Eligible entity__ 

        The term “eligible entity” means any person whose application for certification is principally intended for use in a domestic project which employs domestic gasification applications related to—

The total amounts of credit that may be allocated under the program shall not exceed—

            (A) $350,000,000, plus

        (2) __Period of issuance__ 

            A certificate of eligibility under paragraph (1) may be issued only during the 10-fiscal year period beginning on October 1, 2005.

        (3) __Selection criteria__

            (A) the award recipient is financially viable without the receipt of additional Federal funding associated with the proposed project,

            (B) the recipient will provide sufficient information to the Secretary for the Secretary to ensure that the qualified investment is spent efficiently and effectively,

            (C) a market exists for the products of the proposed project as evidenced by contracts or written statements of intent from potential customers,

            (D) the fuels identified with respect to the gasification technology for such project will comprise at least 90 percent of the fuels required by the project for the production of chemical feedstocks, liquid transportation fuels, or coproduction of electricity,

            (E) the award recipient’s project team is competent in the construction and operation of the gasification technology proposed, with preference given to those recipients with experience which demonstrates successful and reliable operations of the technology on domestic fuels so identified, and

    (e) __Denial of double benefit__ 

        A credit shall not be allowed under this section for any qualified investment for which a credit is allowed under section 48A.

    (f) __Recapture of credit for failure to sequester__
