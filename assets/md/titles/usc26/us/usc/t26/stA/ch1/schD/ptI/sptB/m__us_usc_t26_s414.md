                If a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his or her ministry participates in a church plan (within the meaning of this section) and in the exercise of such ministry is employed by an employer not otherwise participating in such church plan, then such employer may exclude such minister from being treated as an employee of such employer for purposes of applying sections 401(a)(3), 401(a)(4), and 401(a)(5), as in effect on September 1, 1974, and sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(5), 401(a)(26), 401(k)(3), 401(m), 403(b)(1)(D) (including section 403(b)(12)), and 410 to any stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan (including an annuity described in section 403(b) or a retirement income account described in section 403(b)(9)).

            (A) __In general__ 

            A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee—

                (i) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,

                (ii) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of the benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and

            In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan—

            (B) __Payment to alternate payee if order determined to be qualified domestic relations order__

            (C) __Payment to plan participant in certain cases__ 

            If within the 18-month period described in subparagraph (E)—

                (i) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or

                (ii) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,

            (C) An individual reemployed under such chapter is entitled to accrued benefits that are contingent on the making of, or derived from, employee contributions or elective deferrals only to the extent the individual makes payment to the plan with respect to such contributions or deferrals. No such payment may exceed the amount the individual would have been permitted or required to contribute had the individual remained continuously employed by the employer throughout the period of qualified military service. Any payment to such plan shall be made during the period beginning with the date of reemployment and whose duration is 3 times the period of the qualified military service (but not greater than 5 years).

        (9) __Treatment in the case of death or disability resulting from active military service__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For benefit accrual purposes, an employer sponsoring a retirement plan may treat an individual who dies or becomes disabled (as defined under the terms of the plan) while performing qualified military service with respect to the employer maintaining the plan as if the individual has resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, on the day preceding death or disability (as the case may be) and terminated employment on the actual date of death or disability. In the case of any such treatment, and subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), any full or partial compliance by such plan with respect to the benefit accrual requirements of paragraph (8) with respect to such individual shall be treated for purposes of paragraph (1) as if such compliance were required under such chapter 43.

            (B) __Nondiscrimination requirement__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall apply only if all individuals performing qualified military service with respect to the employer maintaining the plan (as determined under subsections (b), (c), (m), and (o)) who die or became disabled as a result of performing qualified military service prior to reemployment by the employer are credited with service and benefits on reasonably equivalent terms.

            (C) __Determination of benefits__ 

            The amount of employee contributions and the amount of elective deferrals of an individual treated as reemployed under subparagraph (A) for purposes of applying paragraph (8)(C) shall be determined on the basis of the individual’s average actual employee contributions or elective deferrals for the lesser of—

                (i) the 12-month period of service with the employer immediately prior to qualified military service, or

                (ii) if service with the employer is less than such 12-month period, the actual length of continuous service with the employer.

        (10) __Plans not subject to title 38__ 

            This subsection shall not apply to any retirement plan to which chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, does not apply.

        (11) __References__ 

            For purposes of this section, any reference to chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, shall be treated as a reference to such chapter as in effect on December 12, 1994 (without regard to any subsequent amendment).

                (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment shall be treated as an employee of the employer making the payment,

                (ii) the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation, and

                (iii) the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in paragraph (1)(C) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage payment.

            (B) __Special rule for distributions__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(i), for purposes of section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(I), 403(b)(7)(A)(ii), 403(b)(11)(A), or 457(d)(1)(A)(ii), an individual shall be treated as having been severed from employment during any period the individual is performing service in the uniformed services described in section 3401(h)(2)(A).

                (ii) __Limitation__ 

                    If an individual elects to receive a distribution by reason of clause (i), the plan shall provide that the individual may not make an elective deferral or employee contribution during the 6-month period beginning on the date of the distribution.

            (C) __Nondiscrimination requirement__ 

                Subparagraph (A)(iii) shall apply only if all employees of an employer (as determined under subsections (b), (c), (m), and (o)) performing service in the uniformed services described in section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive differential wage payments on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to participate in a retirement plan maintained by the employer, to make contributions based on the payments on reasonably equivalent terms.

            A plan shall not permit additional elective deferrals under paragraph (1) for any year in an amount greater than the lesser of—

                    (I) the participant’s compensation (as defined in section 415(c)(3)) for the year, over

                    (II) any other elective deferrals of the participant for such year which are made without regard to this subsection.

            (B) __Applicable dollar amount__
