    (a) __General rule__ 

    In the case of any short-term obligation to which this section applies, for purposes of this title—

        (2) any interest payable on the obligation (other than interest taken into account in determining the amount of the acquisition discount) shall be included in gross income as it accrues.

    (b) __Short-term obligations to which section applies__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        This section shall apply to any short-term obligation which—

            (A) is held by a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting,

            (C) is held by a bank (as defined in section 581),

            (D) is held by a regulated investment company or a common trust fund,

            (E) is identified by the taxpayer under section 1256(e)(2) as being part of a hedging transaction, or

        (2) __Treatment of obligations held by pass-thru entities__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            This section shall apply also to—

                (i) any short-term obligation which is held by a pass-thru entity which is formed or availed of for purposes of avoiding the provisions of this section, and

                (ii) any short-term obligation which is acquired by a pass-thru entity (not described in clause (i)) during the required accrual period.

            (B) __Required accrual period__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “required accrual period” means the period—

                (ii) which ends with the first taxable year after the taxable year referred to in clause (i) for which the ownership test of subparagraph (C) is not met and with respect to which the Secretary consents to the termination of the required accrual period.

            (C) __Ownership test__ 

                The ownership test of this subparagraph is met for any taxable year if, on at least 90 days during the taxable year, 20 percent or more of the value of the interests in the pass-thru entity are held by persons described in paragraph (1) or by other pass-thru entities to which subparagraph (A) applies.

            (D) __Pass-thru entity__ 

                The term “pass-thru entity” means any partnership, S corporation, trust, or other pass-thru entity.
