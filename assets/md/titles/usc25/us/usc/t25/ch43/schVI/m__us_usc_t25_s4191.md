## § 4191. Authority and requirements

    (a) __Authority__ 

        To such extent or in such amounts as provided in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of this subchapter (including limitations designed to protect and maintain the viability of rental housing units owned or operated by the recipient that were developed under a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 \[[42 U.S.C. 1437][/us/usc/t42/s1437] et seq.\]), and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, guarantee and make commitments to guarantee, the notes or other obligations issued by Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities with tribal approval, for the purposes of financing affordable housing activities described in [section 4132 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s4132] and housing related community development activity as consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

    (b) __Terms of loans__ 

        Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this subchapter on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk.

    (c) __Limitation on outstanding guarantees__ 

        No guarantee or commitment to guarantee shall be made with respect to any note or other obligation if the total outstanding notes or obligations of the issuer guaranteed under this subchapter (excluding any amount defeased under the contract entered into under [section 4192(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s4192/a/1]) would thereby exceed an amount equal to 5 times the amount of the grant approval for the issuer pursuant to subchapter III.

    (d) __Limitation on percentage__ 

        A guarantee made under this subchapter shall guarantee repayment of 95 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on the notes or other obligations guaranteed.
