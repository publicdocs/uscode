            (E)

             to—

                (i) promote the development of private capital markets; and

                As a condition of receiving grant amounts under this subchapter, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, shall to the extent practicable, provide for private nonprofit organizations experienced in the planning and development of affordable housing for Native Hawaiians to carry out affordable housing activities with those grant amounts.
