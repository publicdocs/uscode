        For any housing program that provides assistance through any Indian housing authority, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may provide assistance under such program in any fiscal year notwithstanding any other provision of law that requires the Indian housing authority to provide amounts to match or supplement the amounts provided under such program, if the Indian housing authority has not received amounts for such fiscal year under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 \[[42 U.S.C. 5301][/us/usc/t42/s5301] et seq.\].

    (b) __Extent of waiver__ 

        The authority under subsection (a) to provide assistance notwithstanding requirements regarding matching or supplemental amounts shall be effective only to the extent provided by the Secretary, which shall not extend beyond the fiscal year in which the waiver is made or beyond the receipt of any amounts by an Indian housing authority under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 \[[42 U.S.C. 5301][/us/usc/t42/s5301] et seq.\].
