 __References in Text__ 

    The Civil Rights Act of 1964, referred to in subsecs. (c)(2)(E)(i)(I) and (d)(1), is [Pub. L. 88–352][/us/pl/88/352], July 2, 1964, [78 Stat. 241][/us/stat/78/241], as amended. Title VI of the Act is classified generally to subchapter V (§ 2000d et seq.) of chapter 21 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 2000a of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s2000a] and Tables.

    The Fair Housing Act, referred to in subsecs. (c)(2)(E)(i)(I) and (d)(1), is title VIII of [Pub. L. 90–284][/us/pl/90/284], Apr. 11, 1968, [82 Stat. 81][/us/stat/82/81], as amended, which is classified principally to subchapter I (§ 3601 et seq.) of chapter 45 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 3601 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s3601] and Tables.

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 106–568][/us/pl/106/568], § 203, and [Pub. L. 106–569][/us/pl/106/569], § 513, enacted substantially identical sections 803 of [Pub. L. 104–330][/us/pl/104/330]. This section is based on the text of [section 803 of Pub. L. 104–330][/us/pl/104/330/s803], as added by [Pub. L. 106–569][/us/pl/106/569], § 513. [Section 803 of Pub. L. 104–330][/us/pl/104/330/s803], as added by [Pub. L. 106–568][/us/pl/106/568], referred to title VIII of the Act popularly known as the Civil Rights Act of 1968 instead of the Fair Housing Act in subsecs. (c)(2)(E)(i)(I) and (d)(1). Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is title VIII of [Pub. L. 90–284][/us/pl/90/284] which is known as the Fair Housing Act, see References in Text note above. The reference to “such title” in subsec. (c)(2)(E)(i)(I) probably refers to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the Fair Housing Act).
