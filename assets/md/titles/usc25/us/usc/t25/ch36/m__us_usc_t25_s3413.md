## § 3413. Administration of funds and overage

    (a) __Administration of funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Program funds shall be administered in such a manner as to allow for a determination that funds from specific programs (or an amount equal to the amount attracted from each program) are spent on allowable activities authorized under such program.

        (2) __Separate records not required__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the tribe to maintain separate records tracing any services or activities conducted under its approved plan to the individual programs under which funds were authorized, nor shall the tribe be required to allocate expenditures among such individual programs.

    (b) __Overage__ 

        All administrative costs may be commingled and participating Indian tribes shall be entitled to the full amount of such costs (under each program or department’s regulations), and no overage shall be counted for Federal audit purposes, provided that the overage is used for the purposes provided for under this chapter.
