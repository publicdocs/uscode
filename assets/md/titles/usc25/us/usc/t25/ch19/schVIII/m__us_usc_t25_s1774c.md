    (c) __United States__ 

        (1) The United States shall not serve in a capacity to approve leases of the Seneca Nation.

        (2) Federal funds may not be obligated or expended, directly or indirectly, for annual payments under any such lease, except for funds that may be available under a conventional, nationwide program.
