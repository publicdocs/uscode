        (2)

            (A) By virtue of the approval of a transfer of lands or natural resources effected by this section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby, all claims against the United States, the State or subdivision thereof, or any other person or entity, by the tribe or any predecessor or successor in interest, arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such lands or natural resources, including claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy, shall be extinguished as of the date of the transfer.

            (B) The United States shall not be liable directly or indirectly for any claim or cause of action arising from the approval of the Settlement Agreement and compact or exhibits attached thereto.

        (3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as extinguishing any right, title, interest, or claim to lands or natural resources in the State based on use and occupancy or acquired under Federal or State law by any individual Indian which is not derived from or through the tribe, its predecessor or predecessors in interest, or some other American Indian tribe.

        (4) Any Indian, Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, other than the Seminole Tribe as defined in [section 1772a(1) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1772a/1], or any predecessor or successor in interest, or any member thereof, whose transfer of lands or natural resources is approved or whose aboriginal title or claims is extinguished by paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection may, within a period of one year after publication of the Secretary’s finding pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, bring an action against the State and the United States in the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida.

        (2) grants consent to any future changes in the Settlement Agreement or compact that could impose any obligation or liability on the United States, or
