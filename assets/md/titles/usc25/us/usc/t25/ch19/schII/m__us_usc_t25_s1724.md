    (a) __Establishment of Maine Indian Claims Settlement Fund; amount__ 

        There is hereby established in the United States Treasury a fund to be known as the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Fund in which $27,000,000 shall be deposited following the appropriation of sums authorized by [section 1733 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1733].

    (b) __Apportionment of settlement fund; administration; investments; limitation on distributions; quarterly investment income payments; expenditures for aged members; cessation of trust responsibility following Federal payments__ 

        (1) One-half of the principal of the settlement fund shall be held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the other half of the settlement fund shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Penobscot Nation. Each portion of the settlement fund shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with reasonable terms established by the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, respectively, and agreed to by the Secretary: Provided, That the Secretary may not agree to terms which provide for investment of the settlement fund in a manner not in accordance with [section 162a of this title][/us/usc/t25/s162a], unless the respective tribe or nation first submits a specific waiver of liability on the part of the United States for any loss which may result from such an investment: Provided, further, That until such terms have been agreed upon, the Secretary shall fix the terms for the administration of the portion of the settlement fund as to which there is no agreement.

        (2) Under no circumstances shall any part of the principal of the settlement fund be distributed to either the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, or to any member of either tribe or nation: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall prevent the Secretary from investing the principal of said fund in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.

        (3) The Secretary shall make available to the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation in quarterly payments, without any deductions except as expressly provided in [section 1725(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1725/d/2] and without liability to or on the part of the United States, any income received from the investment of that portion of the settlement fund allocated to the respective tribe or nation, the use of which shall be free of regulation by the Secretary. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation annually shall each expend the income from $1,000,000 of their portion of the settlement fund for the benefit of their respective members who are over the age of sixty. Once payments under this paragraph have been made to the tribe or nation, the United States shall have no further trust responsibility to the tribe or nation or their members with respect to the sums paid, any subsequent distribution of these sums, or any property or services purchased therewith.

    (c) __Establishment of Maine Indian Claims Land Acquisition Fund; amount__ 

        There is hereby established in the United States Treasury a fund to be known as the Maine Indian Claims Land Acquisition Fund in which $54,500,000 shall be deposited following the appropriation of sums authorized by [section 1733 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1733].

The first 150,000 acres of land or natural resources acquired for the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the first 150,000 acres acquired for the Penobscot Nation within the area described in the Maine Implementing Act as eligible to be included within the Passamaquoddy Indian Territory and the Penobscot Indian Territory shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the respective tribe or nation. The Secretary is also authorized to take in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation any land or natural resources acquired within the aforesaid area by purchase, gift, or exchange by such tribe or nation. Land or natural resources acquired outside the boundaries of the aforesaid areas shall be held in fee by the respective tribe or nation, and the United States shall have no further trust responsibility with respect thereto. Land or natural resources acquired within the State of Maine for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the band: Provided, That no land or natural resources shall be so acquired for or on behalf of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians without the prior enactment of appropriate legislation by the State of Maine approving such acquisition: Provided further, That the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation shall each have a one-half undivided interest in the corpus of the trust, which shall consist of any such property or subsequently acquired exchange property, in the event the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians should terminate its interest in the trust.

        (4)

         The Secretary is authorized to, and at the request of either party shall, participate in negotiations between the State of Maine and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the purpose of assisting in securing agreement as to the land or natural resources to be acquired by the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Houlton Band. Such agreement shall be embodied in the legislation enacted by the State of Maine approving the acquisition of such lands as required by paragraph (3). The agreement and the legislation shall be limited to:

            (A) provisions providing restrictions against alienation or taxation of land or natural resources held in trust for the Houlton Band no less restrictive than those provided by this subchapter and the Maine Implementing Act for land or natural resources to be held in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe or Penobscot Nation;

    (e) __Acquisitions contingent upon agreement as to identity of land or natural resources to be sold, purchase price and other terms of sale; condemnation proceedings by Secretary; other acquisition authority barred for benefit of Indians in State of Maine__ 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 3113 and 3114(a) to (d) of title 40, the Secretary may acquire land or natural resources under this section from the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources only if the Secretary and the ostensible owner of the land or natural resources have agreed upon the identity of the land or natural resources to be sold and upon the purchase price and other terms of sale. Subject to the agreement required by the preceding sentence, the Secretary may institute condemnation proceedings in order to perfect title, satisfactory to the Attorney General, in the United States and condemn interests adverse to the ostensible owner.

        Land or natural resources acquired by the Secretary in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation shall be managed and administered in accordance with terms established by the respective tribe or nation and agreed to by the Secretary in accordance with [section 450f of this title][/us/usc/t25/s450f], or other existing law.

When the proceeds are reinvested in land whose acreage does not exceed that of the land taken, all the land shall be acquired in trust. When the proceeds are invested in land whose acreage exceeds the acreage of the land taken, the respective tribe or nation shall designate, with the approval of the United States, and within thirty days of such reinvestment, that portion of the land acquired by the reinvestment, not to exceed the area taken, which shall be acquired in trust. The land not acquired in trust shall be held in fee by the respective tribe or nation. The Secretary shall certify, in writing, to the Secretary of State of the State of Maine the location, boundaries, and status of the land acquired.
