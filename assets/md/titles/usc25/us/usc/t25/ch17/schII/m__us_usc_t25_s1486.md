## § 1486. Loans ineligible for guaranty or insurance

    Loans made by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government (not including an eligible Community Development Finance Institution), or by an organization of Indians from funds borrowed from the United States, and loans the interest on which is not included in gross income for the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26 shall not be eligible for guaranty or insurance hereunder.

([Pub. L. 93–262, title II][/us/pl/93/262/tII], § 206, Apr. 12, 1974, [88 Stat. 80][/us/stat/88/80]; [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514], § 2, Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095]; [Pub.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–221][/us/pl/109/221] inserted “(not including an eligible Community Development Finance Institution)” after “Government”.

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.
