>     Congress finds that—

>         “(1) the Indian Financing Act of 1974 ([25 U.S.C. 1451][/us/usc/t25/s1451] et seq.) was intended to provide Native American borrowers with access to commercial sources of capital that otherwise would not be available through the guarantee or insurance of loans by the Secretary of the Interior;
