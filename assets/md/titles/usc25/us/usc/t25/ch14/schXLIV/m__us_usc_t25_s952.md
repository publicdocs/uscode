## § 952. Members entitled to allotment; prohibition against further allotments

    Any member of the Agua Caliente Band (hereinafter called the “band”) who is living on September 21, 1959, and who has not received an allotment of land shall be given an allotment in accordance with the provisions of law existing prior to this Act. No further allotments of land shall thereafter be made to any other or future born members of the band, or to their heirs or devisees, except for the purpose of equalization. This prohibition against further allotments shall not be construed as a closing of the band’s membership rolls.
