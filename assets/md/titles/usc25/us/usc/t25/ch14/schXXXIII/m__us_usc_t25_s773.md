## § 773. Payments

    (a) __Enrollees, next of kin, or legatees__ 

        The Secretary shall make payments directly to a living enrollee. The Secretary shall distribute the share of a person determined to be eligible for enrollment, but who dies subsequent to August 30, 1954, and on whose behalf an application is filed and approved, and the share of a deceased enrollee, directly to his next of kin or legatees as determined by the laws of the domicile of the decedent, upon proof of death and inheritance satisfactory to the Secretary, whose findings upon such proof shall be final and conclusive.

    (b) __Minors and persons under legal disability; guardians__ 

        Payments due persons under twenty-one years of age or persons under legal disability shall be made in accordance with laws applicable to such persons in the State of domicile of the payee. The Secretary may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a guardian to receive and administer payments due a person under twenty-one years of age or under legal disability, and may take such other action as he deems appropriate for the protection of the interests of any such person in connection with payments hereunder.

    (c) __Payments not subject to debts; time limits__ 

        No part of any payment hereunder shall be subject to any debt or debts created prior to August 30, 1954 by a beneficiary of Indian blood. Payment to living enrollees, unless under twenty-one years of age, or under legal disability, shall be completed within one year after approval of the tribal rolls. Payment to next of kin and legatees, and payment for the account of persons under twenty-one years of age or under legal disability shall be completed within the same period of time to the maximum extent possible.
