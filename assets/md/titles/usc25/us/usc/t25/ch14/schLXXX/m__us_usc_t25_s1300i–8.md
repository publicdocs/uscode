        (4) The Interim Council shall appoint, as soon as practical, a drafting committee which shall be responsible, in consultation with the Interim Council, the Secretary and members of the tribe, for the preparation of a draft constitution for submission to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.
