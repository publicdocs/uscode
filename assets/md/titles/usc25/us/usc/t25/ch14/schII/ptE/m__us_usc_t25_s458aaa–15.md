    (b) __Discretionary application__ 

        At the request of a participating Indian tribe, any other provision of part A of this subchapter, to the extent such provision is not in conflict with this part, shall be made a part of a funding agreement or compact entered into under this part. The Secretary is obligated to include such provision at the option of the participating Indian tribe or tribes. If such provision is incorporated it shall have the same force and effect as if it were set out in full in this part.
