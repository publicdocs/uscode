The balance of such funds, and the interest thereon, may be advanced or expended for any purpose that is authorized by the tribal governing body and approved by the Secretary. The amount of $150,000 of said funds and any interest thereon shall not be distributed, advanced or expended until said $150,000 and any interest thereon becomes available for disbursement pursuant to the terms of the final judgment dated April 14, 1964, by the Indian Claims Commission in docket numbered 138.
