>     “(6) the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the responsibility of keeping a list of all federally recognized tribes;

>     “(8) the list of federally recognized tribes which the Secretary publishes should reflect all of the federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States which are eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.”
