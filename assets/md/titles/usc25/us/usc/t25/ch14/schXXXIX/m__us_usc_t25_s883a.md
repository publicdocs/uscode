        Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a share or proportional share payable to a living original Osage allottee shall be paid to such allottee.

    (b) __Distribution to heirs; heirship determinations; intestate succession; finality of determinations and distributions; reversion of minimal amounts__ 

        A share of a deceased Osage allottee having died prior to or after October 27, 1972, shall be distributed to his heirs of Osage Indian blood pursuant to an order determining heirs by the Secretary of the Interior or a court of competent jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma, and such distributions by the Secretary of the Interior shall be final and conclusive. In the event the heirs of Osage Indian blood of an Osage Indian having died prior to or after October 27, 1972, have not been determined by the Secretary of the Interior or a court of competent jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma, such share shall be distributed to the heirs of Osage Indian blood upon the filing of proof of death and inheritance in accordance with the Oklahoma law of intestate succession in a form satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior whose findings and determinations upon such proof shall be final and conclusive: Provided, That when a person of Osage Indian blood receives an amount totaling less than $20 from one or more shares of one or more Osage allottees, that amount shall not be distributed to the individual, but will revert to the Osage Tribe.

    (c) __Minors and persons under guardianship; rules and regulations__ 

        A share or proportional share payable to a person of Osage Indian blood under eighteen years of age and any person under guardianship pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction notwithstanding the fact he has received a certificate of competency shall be disbursed under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.
