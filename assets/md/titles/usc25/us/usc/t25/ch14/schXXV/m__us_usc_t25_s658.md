## § 658. Distribution of $150 from fund to each enrolled Indian

    Notwithstanding the provisions of [section 656 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s656], the Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as he may prescribe, is authorized and directed to distribute per capita the sum of $150 to each Indian of California living on May 24, 1950, who is now or may hereafter be enrolled under sections 651 and 657 of this title. The Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, make such distribution from time to time to persons on the roll of the Indians of California approved on May 16, 1933, as he identifies such enrollees, before the completion of the revised roll provided for in [section 657 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s657]. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw from the fund on deposit in the Treasury of the United States arising from the judgment in favor of the Indians of California entered by the Court of Claims on December 4, 1944, and appropriated for them by [section 203 of the Act of April 25, 1945][/us/act/1945-04-25/s203] ([59 Stat. 77][/us/stat/59/77]), such sums as may be necessary to make the per capita payments required by this section, including not to exceed $15,000 for the purpose of defraying the expenses incident to carrying out the provisions of sections 657 and 658 of this title. Such payments shall be made out of the accumulated interest on such judgment fund and so much of the principal thereof as is necessary to complete the payments. The money paid to enrollees pursuant to this section shall not be subject to any lien or claim of any nature against any such persons, except for debts owing to the United States.
