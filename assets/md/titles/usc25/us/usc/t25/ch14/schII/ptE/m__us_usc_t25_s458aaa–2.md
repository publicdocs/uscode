            (B) __Effect of withdrawal__ 

                If an Indian tribe has withdrawn from participation in an inter-tribal consortium or tribal organization, that Indian tribe shall be entitled to its tribal share of funds supporting those programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) that the Indian tribe will be carrying out under the compact and funding agreement of the Indian tribe.
