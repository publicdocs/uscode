## § 564g. Individual property

    (a) __Transfer of unrestricted control__ 

        The Secretary is authorized and directed to transfer within four years from August 13, 1954, to each member of the tribe unrestricted control of funds or other personal property held in trust for such member by the United States.

    (b) __Removal of restrictions on sales or encumbrances; fee simple title__ 

        All restrictions on the sale or encumbrance of trust or restricted interests in land, wherever located, owned by members of the tribe (including allottees, purchasers, heirs, and devisees, either adult or minor), and on trust or restricted interests in land within the Klamath Indian Reservation, regardless of ownership, are removed four years after August 13, 1954, and the patents or deeds under which titles are then held shall pass the titles in fee simple, subject to any valid encumbrances. The titles to all interests in trust or restricted land acquired by members of the tribe by devise or inheritance four years or more after August 13, 1954, shall vest in such members in fee simple, subject to any valid encumbrance.

    (c) __Multiple land ownership; partition; sale; election to purchase; unlocated owners__ 

    Prior to the time provided in subsection (b) of this section for the removal of restrictions on land owned by one or by more than one member of a tribe, the Secretary may—

        (1) upon request of any of the owners, partition the land and issue to each owner a patent or deed for his individual share that shall become unrestricted four years from August 13, 1954;

        (2) upon request of any of the owners, and a finding by the Secretary that partition of all or any part of the land is not practicable, cause all or any part of the land to be sold at not less than the appraised value thereof and distribute the proceeds of sale to the owners: Provided, That any one or more of the owners may elect before a sale to purchase the other interests in the land at not less than the appraised value thereof, and the purchaser shall receive an unrestricted patent or deed to the land; and

        (3) if the whereabouts of none of the owners can be ascertained, cause such lands to be sold and deposit the proceeds of sale in the Treasury of the United States for safekeeping.

    (d) __Approval of exchanges or sales by Secretary__ 

    The Secretary is authorized to approve—

        (1) the exchange of trust or restricted land between the tribe and any of its members;

        (2) the sale by the tribe of tribal property to individual members of the tribe; and

        (3) the exchange of tribal property for real property in fee status. Title to all real property included in any sale or exchange as provided in this subsection shall be conveyed in fee simple.
