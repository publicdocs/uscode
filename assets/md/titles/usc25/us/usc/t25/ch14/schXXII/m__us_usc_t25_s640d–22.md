## § 640d–22. Authorization for exchange of reservation lands; availability of additional relocation benefits; restrictions

    The Navajo and Hopi Tribes are hereby authorized to exchange lands which are part of their respective reservations. In the event that the tribes should negotiate and agree on an exchange of lands pursuant to authority granted herein the Commissioner shall make available 125 per centum of the relocation benefits provided in sections 640d–13 and 640d–14 of this title to members of either tribe living on land to be exchanged to other than his or her own tribe, except that such benefits shall be available only if, within one hundred and eighty days of the agreement, a majority of the adult members of the tribe who would be eligible to relocate from exchanged lands sign a contract with the Commissioner to relocate within twelve months of the agreement or such later time as determined by the Commissioner and such additional benefits shall only be paid to those who actually relocate within such period.
