## § 587. Funds apportioned to Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation

    (a) __Distribution to enrollees__ 

        The funds apportioned to the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation shall be placed to their credit in the United States Treasury. Seventy-five percent of such funds shall be distributed per capita to all persons born on or before and living on December 18, 1971, who are duly enrolled on the roll prepared in accordance with [section 585(a) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s585/a].

    (b) __Determination of per capita share__ 

        The per capita shares shall be determined on the basis of the number of persons eligible for per capitas and the number of persons rejected for per capitas who have taken a timely appeal. The shares of those persons whose appeals are denied shall revert to the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes to be expended for any purpose designated by the tribal governing body and approved by the Secretary.

    (c) __Trust for minors and persons under legal disability__ 

        Sums payable to enrollees or their heirs or legatees who are less than twenty-one years of age or who are under a legal disability shall be paid in accordance with such procedures, including the establishment of trusts, as the Secretary of the Interior determines appropriate to protect the best interests of such persons.

    (d) __Remaining funds__ 

        The funds remaining after provision is made for the per capita distribution may be used, advanced, expended, invested, or reinvested for any purpose authorized by the tribal governing body and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.
