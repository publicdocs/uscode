## § 766. Tribal reservation

    (a) __Transfer of real property to Secretary; existing rights applicable and status of property subsequent to transfer; taxation__ 

        The Secretary, within one year following April 3, 1980, shall accept the real property of members of the tribe or bands if conveyed or otherwise transferred to him, and real property held for the benefit of members of the tribe or bands if conveyed or otherwise transferred to him by the owner or owners of such land held for the benefit of the bands. Such property shall be subject to all valid existing rights including, but not limited to, liens, outstanding taxes (local and State), and mortgages. The land transferred to the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of any valid existing obligation in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah. Subject to the conditions imposed by this subsection, the land transferred shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the tribe or bands to be held as Indian lands are held, and shall be part of their reservation. The transfer of real property authorized by this section shall be exempt from all local, State, and Federal taxation. All real property transferred under this section shall, as of the date of transfer, be exempt from all local, State, and Federal taxation.

    (b) __Exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction by Utah__ 

        The State of Utah shall exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction with respect to the reservation and persons on the reservation as if it had assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the Act of August 15, 1953 ([67 Stat. 588][/us/stat/67/588]), as amended by the Act of April 11, 1968 ([82 Stat. 79][/us/stat/82/79]), and pursuant to sections 63–36–9 through 63–36–21 of the Utah State Code.

    (c) __Plan for enlargement of reservation; negotiation; development; scope and approval__ 

        Inasmuch as the Kanosh, Koosharem and Indian Peaks Bands of Paiute Indians lost land which had been their former reservations and the Cedar Band of Paiute Indians had never had a reservation, the Secretary shall negotiate with the tribe or bands, or with representatives of the tribe chosen by the tribe or bands, concerning the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe established pursuant to subsection (a) and shall within two years after April 3, 1980, develop a plan for the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe. The plan shall include acquisition of not to exceed a total of fifteen thousand acres of land to be selected from available public, State, or private lands within Beaver, Iron, Millard, Sevier, or Washington Counties, Utah. Upon approval of such plan by the tribal officials elected under the tribal constitution and bylaws adopted pursuant to [section 765 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s765], the Secretary shall submit such plan, in the form of proposed legislation, to the Congress.

    (d) __Notification and consultative requirements for enlargement plan__ 

    To assure that legitimate State and local interests are not prejudiced by the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe, the Secretary, in developing the plan under subsection (c) for the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe, shall notify and consult with all appropriate officials of the State of Utah, all appropriate local government officials in the affected five county area in the State of Utah and any other interested parties. Such consultation shall include the following subjects:

        (1) the size and location of the additions to the reservation;

        (2) the effect the enlargement of the reservation would have on State and local tax revenues;

        (3) the criminal and civil jurisdiction of the State of Utah with respect to the reservation and persons on the reservation;

        (4) hunting, fishing, and trapping rights of the tribe, and members of the tribe, on the reservation;

        (5) the provision of State and local services to the reservation and to the tribe and members of the tribe on the reservation; and

        (6) the provision of Federal services to the reservation and to the tribe and members of the tribe and the provision of services by the tribe to members of the tribe.

    (e) __Contents of enlargement plan__ 

    Any plan developed under this section for the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe shall provide that—

        (1) the enlargement of the reservation will not grant or restore to the tribe or any member of the tribe any hunting, fishing, or trapping right of any nature, including any indirect or procedural right or advantage, on such addition to the reservation;

        (2) the Secretary shall not accept any real property in trust for the benefit of the tribe or bands unless such real property is located either within Beaver, Iron, Millard, Sevier, or Washington Counties, State of Utah;

        (3) the transfer of any real property to the Secretary in trust for the benefit of the tribe or bands as an addition to the reservation shall be exempt from all Federal, State, and local taxation, and all such real property shall, as of the date of such transfer, be exempt from Federal, State, and local taxation; and

        (4) the State of Utah shall exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction with respect to the addition to the reservation and persons on such lands as if it had assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the Act of August 15, 1953 ([67 Stat. 588][/us/stat/67/588]), as amended by the Act of April 11, 1968 ([82 Stat. 79][/us/stat/82/79]), and pursuant to sections 63–36–9 through 63–36–21 of the Utah State Code.

    (f) __Statement appended to enlargement plan respecting implementation of notification and consultative requirements__ 

        The Secretary shall append to the plan a detailed statement describing the manner in which the notification and consultation prescribed by subsection (d) was carried out and shall include any written comments with respect to the enlargement of the reservation for the tribe submitted to the Secretary by State and local officials and other interested parties in the course of such consultation.
