## § 541. Creation of individual credits; authorized purchases

    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed from the judgment fund of the Klamath and Modoc Tribes and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians created as the result of the passage of the Act of June 25, 1938, and accrued interest thereon, to credit the sum of $2,000 upon the books of the Office of Indian Affairs, to each person determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be entitled to enrollment upon the annuity roll of said tribes of the Klamath Reservation, Oregon, living on August 7, 1939. The share of each adult member and not to exceed $1,500 of the share of any minor shall be available for expenditure, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, for the following purposes:

    Purchase of land; improvement of lands acquired or already held by the Indian; erection and improvement of suitable homes; repayment of any loans received from the United States or from the Klamath tribal funds; purchase of building material, farming equipment, livestock, feed, food, seed, grain, tools, machinery, implements, household goods, bedding, clothing, and any other equipment or supplies necessary to enable the Indians to fit themselves for or to engage in farming, livestock, industry, or such other pursuits or vocations, including education, as will enable them to become self-supporting; and health purposes: Provided, however, That the funds of the aged, infirm, decrepit, and incapacitated members, and of minors, may be used for their proper maintenance and support. The remainder of the share of each minor Indian shall be held intact until such Indian reaches his majority, when it, together with interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum, shall be available for expenditure for the purposes specified herein. As herein used, the term “minor” shall include all members of the tribe less than twenty-one years of age, except that minors eighteen years of age or over and who are married or have families of their own to support, shall be regarded as adults. On the death of any enrolled member, adult, or minor, the sum on deposit to his credit shall be distributed as personal property, and shall be available for expenditure by the distributees only for the purposes herein authorized: Provided, however, That of the aforesaid $2,000 to be prorated to each person, $100 shall be paid to each member of said tribes as a per capita payment, free from the aforesaid restrictions, under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.

 __References in Text__ 

    Act of June 25, 1938, referred to in text, probably refers to the Second Deficiency Appropriation Act, fiscal year 1938, [act June 25, 1938, ch. 681, § 203(a)][/us/act/1938-06-25/ch681/s203/a], [52 Stat. 1156][/us/stat/52/1156]. Section 203(a) of that act provided for an appropriation for payment of judgments rendered by the court of claims and reported to the 75th Congress in Senate Document Numbered 191, and House Documents Numbered 661 and 686. House Document No. 681 listed a judgment in favor of the Klamath and Modoc Tribes and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians in the sum of $5,313,347.32, with interest on a part thereof to date of payment, for the taking of land.
