        Within one year of January 8, 1983, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the Tribe, compile a roll of those members of the Tribe who possess Kickapoo blood and who are also members of the Band. When said roll is complete, the Secretary shall immediately publish notice in the Federal Register stating that the roll has been completed. The Secretary shall ensure that the roll, once completed, is maintained and that it is current.

        If the Secretary does not compile the roll within the period prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, he shall submit a report to Congress setting forth the reasons he did not do so.

        For a period of five years after the publication of the Federal Register notice required under subsection (a) of this section, any member of the Band whose name appears on the roll compiled by the Secretary, may, at his option, apply for United States citizenship. Such application shall be made to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and, upon receipt of the application, citizenship shall promptly be granted to the applicant.
