>     “(d)  __Adjudication of Water Rights on Newly Acquired Trust Lands__  __.—__ 

>     The Tribe’s water rights on newly acquired trust lands shall be adjudicated with the rights of all other competing users in the court now presiding over the Little Colorado River Adjudication, or if that court no longer has jurisdiction, in the appropriate State or Federal court. Any controversies between or among users arising under Federal or State law involving the Tribe’s water rights on newly acquired trust lands shall be resolved in the court now presiding over the Little Colorado River Adjudication, or, if that court no longer has jurisdiction, in the appropriate State or Federal court.

>     “(h)  __Statutory Construction__  __.—__ 

>     Nothing in this section shall be construed to determine the law applicable to water use on lands owned by the United States, other than on the newly acquired trust lands. The granting of the right to make beneficial use of unappropriated surface water on the newly acquired trust lands with a priority date such lands are taken into trust shall not be construed to imply that such right is a Federal reserved water right. Nothing in this section or any other provision of this Act shall be construed to establish any Federal reserved right to groundwater. Authority for the Secretary to take land into trust for the Tribe pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and this Act shall be construed as having been provided solely by the provisions of this Act.”
