Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any law establishing such services or benefits, eligibility of the tribe and its members for such Federal services and benefits shall become effective April 3, 1980, without regard to the existence of a reservation for the tribe or the residence of members of the tribe on a reservation. For the purpose of providing for Federal services and benefits, the service area shall be Iron, Millard, Sevier, and Washington Counties, Utah, except that should lands in any other county be added to the reservation pursuant to [section 766(c) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s766/c], the service area shall also include the area on or near the additions to the reservation.
