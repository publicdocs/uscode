    The funds apportioned to the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin and the Stockbridge-Munsee Indian Community of Wisconsin shall be placed to their credit and may be used, advanced, expended, deposited, invested, or reinvested for any purposes that are authorized by the tribal governing bodies thereof and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The funds apportioned to the group mentioned in [section 1142(c) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1142/c] shall be available for distribution in equal shares to the enrollees or their heirs or legatees.
