## § 458aaa–5. General provisions

    (a) __Applicability__ 

        The provisions of this section shall apply to compacts and funding agreements negotiated under this part and an Indian tribe may, at its option, include provisions that reflect such requirements in a compact or funding agreement.

    (b) __Conflicts of interest__ 

        Indian tribes participating in self-governance under this part shall ensure that internal measures are in place to address conflicts of interest in the administration of self-governance programs, services, functions, or activities (or portions thereof).

    (c) __Audits__ 

        (1) __Single Agency Audit Act__ 

            The provisions of chapter 75 of title 31 requiring a single agency audit report shall apply to funding agreements under this part.

        (2) __Cost principles__ 

            An Indian tribe shall apply cost principles under the applicable Office of Management and Budget circular, except as modified by [section 450j–1 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s450j–1]  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  other provisions of law, or by any exemptions to applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars subsequently granted by the Office of Management and Budget. No other audit or accounting standards shall be required by the Secretary. Any claim by the Federal Government against the Indian tribe relating to funds received under a funding agreement based on any audit under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of [section 450j–1(f) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s450j–1/f].

    (d) __Records__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Unless an Indian tribe specifies otherwise in the compact or funding agreement, records of the Indian tribe shall not be considered Federal records for purposes of chapter 5 of title 5.

    (e) __Redesign and consolidation__ 

        An Indian tribe may redesign or consolidate programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) included in a funding agreement under [section 458aaa–4 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s458aaa–4] and reallocate or redirect funds for such programs, services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) in any manner which the Indian tribe deems to be in the best interest of the health and welfare of the Indian community being served, only if the redesign or consolidation does not have the effect of denying eligibility for services to population groups otherwise eligible to be served under applicable Federal law.

    (f) __Retrocession__ 

    An Indian tribe may retrocede, fully or partially, to the Secretary programs, services, functions, or activities (or portions thereof) included in the compact or funding agreement.

        (2) __Distribution of funds__ 

        When an Indian tribe or tribal organization eligible to enter into a self-determination contract under part A of this subchapter or a compact or funding agreement under this part fully or partially withdraws from a participating inter-tribal consortium or tribal organization—

            (A) the withdrawing Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be entitled to its tribal share of funds supporting those programs, services, functions, or activities (or portions thereof) that the Indian tribe will be carrying out under its own self-determination contract or compact and funding agreement (calculated on the same basis as the funds were initially allocated in the funding agreement of the inter-tribal consortium or tribal organization); and

            (B) the funds referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be transferred from the funding agreement of the inter-tribal consortium or tribal organization, on the condition that the provisions of sections 450f and 450j(i) of this title, as appropriate, shall apply to that withdrawing Indian tribe.
