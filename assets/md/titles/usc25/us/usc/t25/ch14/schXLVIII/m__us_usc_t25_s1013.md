## § 1013. Distribution; persons entitled; considerations; tax exemption

    The Secretary shall distribute shares payable to living persons enrolled pursuant to [section 1011 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1011] and shares payable to the heirs or legatees of deceased persons enrolled pursuant to [section 1011 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1011] according to rules and regulations which he shall prescribe, taking into account that in some instances a planned individual or group program for the use of shares may more properly serve the long-term interest of the enrollees than would direct, unsupervised per capita payment. The funds so distributed shall not be subject to Federal or State income tax.

([Pub. L. 88–464][/us/pl/88/464], § 3, Aug. 20, 1964, [78 Stat. 563][/us/stat/78/563].)
