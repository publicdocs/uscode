## § 657. Revision of roll of Indians

    The Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as he may prescribe, is authorized and directed to revise the roll of the Indians of California, as defined in [section 651 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s651], which was approved by him on May 16, 1933, in the following particulars: (a) By adding to said roll the names of persons who filed applications for enrollment as Indians of California on or before May 18, 1932, and who, although determined to be descendants of the Indians residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852, were denied enrollment solely on the ground that they were not living in the State of California on May 18, 1928, and who were alive on May 24, 1950; (b) by adding to said roll the names of persons who are descendants of the Indians residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852, and who are the fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts of persons whose names appear on said roll, and who were alive on May 24, 1950, irrespective of whether such fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts were living in the State of California on May 18, 1928; (c) by adding to said roll the names of persons born since May 18, 1928, and living on May 24, 1950, who are the children or other descendants of persons whose names appear on said roll, or of persons whose names are eligible for addition to said roll under clauses (a) or (b) of this section, or of persons dying prior to May 24, 1950, whose names would have been eligible for addition to said roll under clauses (a) or (b) of this section if such persons had been alive on May 24, 1950; and (d) by removing from said roll the names of persons who have died since May 18, 1928, and prior to May 24, 1950. Persons entitled to enrollment under clause (a) of this section shall be enrolled by the Secretary of the Interior without further application. Persons claiming to be entitled to enrollment under clauses (b) or (c) of this section shall, within one year after May 24, 1950, make an application in writing to the Secretary of the Interior for enrollment, unless they have previously filed such an application under this section. For the purposes of clause (d) of this section, when the Secretary of the Interior is satisfied that reasonable and diligent efforts have been made to locate a person whose name is on said roll and that such person cannot be located, he may presume that such person died prior to May 24, 1950, and his presumption shall be conclusive. The Secretary of the Interior shall prepare not less than five hundred copies of an alphabetical list of the Indians of California whose names appear on the roll approved on May 16, 1933, giving the name, address, and age at time of enrollment of each such enrollee, together with such other factual information, if any, as the Secretary may deem advisable as tending to identify each enrollee, and shall distribute copies of this list to the various communities of California Indians. The Indians of California in each community may elect a committee of three enrollees who may aid the enrolling agent in any matters relating to the revision of said roll. After the expiration of the period allowed by this section for filing applications, the Secretary of the Interior shall have until June 30, 1955, to approve and promulgate the revised roll of the Indians of California provided for in this section. Upon such approval and promulgation, the roll shall be closed and thereafter no additional names shall be added thereto.
