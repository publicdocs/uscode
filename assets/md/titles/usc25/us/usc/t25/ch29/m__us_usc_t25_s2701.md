## § 2701. Findings

The Congress finds that—

    (1) numerous Indian tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands as a means of generating tribal governmental revenue;

    (2) Federal courts have held that [section 81 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s81] requires Secretarial review of management contracts dealing with Indian gaming, but does not provide standards for approval of such contracts;

    (3) existing Federal law does not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands;

    (4) a principal goal of Federal Indian policy is to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government; and

    (5) Indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands if the gaming activity is not specifically prohibited by Federal law and is conducted within a State which does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming activity.
