            (A) is enrolled in a course of study at an education institution with which the Secretary has entered into a cooperative agreement; and

            (B) is interested in a career with the Bureau, an Indian tribe or a tribal enterprise in the management of Indian rangelands, farmlands, or other natural resource assets.

        (5) A recipient of assistance under the cooperative education program under this subsection shall be required to enter into an obligated service agreement with the Secretary to serve as a professional in an agricultural resource related activity with the Bureau, or other Federal agency providing agricultural or related services to Indians or Indian tribes, or an Indian tribe for one year for each year for which the Secretary pays the recipients educational costs pursuant to paragraph (3).

            (C) a tribal agriculture or related program.

        (3) The Secretary shall not deny scholarship assistance under this subsection solely on the basis of an applicant’s scholastic achievement if the applicant has been admitted to and remains in good standing in an accredited post secondary  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “postsecondary”. </sup></sup>  or graduate institution.

    (d) __Educational outreach__ 

        The Secretary shall conduct, through the Bureau, and in consultation with other appropriate local, State and Federal agencies, and in consultation and coordination with Indian tribes, an agricultural resource education outreach program for Indian youth to explain and stimulate interest in all aspects of management and careers in Indian agriculture and natural resources.

    (e) __Adequacy of programs__ 

        The Secretary shall administer the programs described in this section until a sufficient number of Indians are trained to ensure that there is an adequate number of qualified, professional Indian agricultural resource managers to manage the Bureau agricultural resource programs and programs maintained by or for Indian tribes.
