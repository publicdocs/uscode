        (2) __Declarations of purpose__ 

            Local school boards for schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in cooperation and consultation with the appropriate tribal governing bodies and their communities, are encouraged to adopt declarations of purpose for education for their communities, taking into account the implications of such declarations on education in their communities and for their schools. In adopting such declarations of purpose, the school boards shall consider the effect the declarations may have on the motivation of students and faculties.

    (b) __Accreditation__ 

        (1) __Deadline__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Not later than 24 months after January 8, 2002, each Bureau-funded school shall, to the extent that necessary funds are provided, be a candidate for accreditation or be accredited—

                (i) by a tribal accrediting body, if the accreditation standards of the tribal accrediting body have been accepted by formal action of the tribal governing body and such accreditation is acknowledged by a generally recognized State certification or regional accrediting agency;

                (ii) by a regional accreditation agency;

                (iii) by State accreditation standards for the State in which the Bureau-funded school is located; or

            (B) __Feasibility study__ 

            Not later than 12 months after January 8, 2002, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Education shall, in consultation with Indian tribes, Indian education organizations, and accrediting agencies, develop and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a tribal accreditation agency that would—

                (i) review and acknowledge the accreditation standards for Bureau-funded schools; and

                (ii) establish accreditation procedures to facilitate the application, review of the standards and review processes, and recognition of qualified and credible tribal departments of education as accrediting bodies serving tribal schools.

        (2) __Determination of accreditation to be applied__ 

            The accreditation type applied for each school shall be determined by the tribal governing body, or the school board, if authorized by the tribal governing body.

        (3) __Assistance to school boards__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                The Secretary, through contracts and grants, shall provide technical and financial assistance to Bureau-funded schools, to the extent that necessary amounts are made available, to enable such schools to obtain the accreditation required under this subsection, if the school boards request that such assistance, in part or in whole, be provided.

            (B) __Entities through which assistance may be provided__ 

                The Secretary may provide such assistance directly or through the Department of Education, an institution of higher education, a private not-for-profit organization or for-profit organization, an educational service agency, or another entity with demonstrated experience in assisting schools in obtaining accreditation.

        (4) __Application of current standards during accreditation__ 

            A Bureau-funded school that is seeking accreditation shall remain subject to the standards issued under this section  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and in effect on the day before January 8, 2002, until such time as the school is accredited, except that if any of such standards are in conflict with the standards of the accrediting agency, the standards of such agency shall apply in such case.

        (5) __Annual report on unaccredited schools__ 

        Not later than 90 days after the end of each school year, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Indian Affairs, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, a report concerning unaccredited Bureau-funded schools that—

            (A) identifies those Bureau-funded schools that fail to be accredited or to be candidates for accreditation within the period provided for in paragraph (1);

            (B) with respect to each Bureau-funded school identified under subparagraph (A), identifies the reasons that each such school is not accredited or a candidate for accreditation, as determined by the appropriate accreditation agency, and a description of any possible way in which to remedy such nonaccreditation; and

            (C) with respect to each Bureau-funded school for which the reported reasons for the lack of accreditation under subparagraph (B) are a result of the school’s inadequate basic resources, contains information and funding requests for the full funding needed to provide such schools with accreditation, such funds if provided shall be applied to such unaccredited school under this paragraph.

        (6) __Opportunity to review and present evidence__ 

            (A) __In general__

The school plan shall cover a 3-year period and shall—

                (i) incorporate strategies that address the specific issues that caused the school to fail to be accredited or fail to be a candidate for accreditation;

                (ii) incorporate policies and practices concerning the school that have the greatest likelihood of ensuring that the school will obtain accreditation during the 3-year period beginning on the date on which the plan is implemented;

            (B) __Implementation__ 

                A school shall implement the school plan under subparagraph (A) expeditiously, but in no event later than the beginning of the school year following the school year in which the school was included in the annual report under paragraph (5) so long as the necessary resources have been provided to the school.

            In this subsection, the term “corrective action” means any action that—

                (i)

                 substantially and directly responds to—

Probably should be “Regulations,”. </sup></sup>  as in effect on January 8, 2002) if the school—

                (i) is identified in the report described in paragraph (5)(C); and

                (ii)

                 fails to be accredited for reasons that are beyond the control of the school board, as determined by the Secretary, including, but not limited to—

                    (I) a significant decline in financial resources;

                    (II) the poor condition of facilities, vehicles, or other property; and

                    (III) a natural disaster.

            (C) __Duties of Secretary__ 

            After providing assistance to a school under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall—

            (D) __Failure of school plan of Bureau-operated school__ 

            With respect to a Bureau-operated school that fails to be accredited at the end of the third full year immediately following the date that the school’s plan was first in effect under paragraph (7), the Secretary may take one or more of the following corrective actions:

                (i) Institute and fully implement actions suggested by the accrediting agency.

                    (II) If the tribe declines to assume control of the school, the Secretary, in consultation with the tribe, may contract with an outside entity, consistent with applicable law, or appoint a receiver or trustee to operate and administer the affairs of the school until the school is accredited. The outside entity, receiver, or trustee shall prepare a plan, pursuant to paragraph (7), for approval by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (7).

                    (III) Upon accreditation of the school, the Secretary shall allow the tribe to continue to operate the school as a grant or contract school, or if the school is being controlled by an outside entity, provide the tribe with the option to assume operation of the school as a contract school, in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450f][/us/usc/t25/s450f] et seq.\], or as a grant school in accordance with the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 \[[25 U.S.C. 2501][/us/usc/t25/s2501] et seq.\], at the beginning of the school year following the school year in which the school obtains accreditation.
