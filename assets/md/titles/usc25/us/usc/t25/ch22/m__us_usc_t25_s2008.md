## § 2008. Administrative cost grants

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    In this section:

        (1) __Administrative cost__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “administrative cost” means the cost of necessary administrative functions which—

                (i) the tribe or tribal organization incurs as a result of operating a tribal elementary or secondary educational program;

                (ii) are not customarily paid by comparable Bureau-operated programs out of direct program funds; and

                (iii)

                 are either—

                    (I) normally provided for comparable Bureau programs by Federal officials using resources other than Bureau direct program funds; or

                    (II) are otherwise required of tribal self-determination program operators by law or prudent management practice.

            (B) __Inclusions__ 

            The term “administrative cost” may include—

                (i) contract or grant (or other agreement) administration;

                (ii) executive, policy, and corporate leadership and decisionmaking;

                (iii) program planning, development, and management;

                (iv) fiscal, personnel, property, and procurement management;

                (v) related office services and record keeping; and

                (vi) costs of necessary insurance, auditing, legal, safety and security services.

        (2) __Bureau elementary and secondary functions__ 

        The term “Bureau elementary and secondary functions” means—

            (A) all functions funded at Bureau schools by the Office;

            (B)

             all programs—

                (i) funds for which are appropriated to other agencies of the Federal Government; and

                (ii) which are administered for the benefit of Indians through Bureau schools; and

            (C) all operation, maintenance, and repair funds for facilities and Government quarters used in the operation or support of elementary and secondary education functions for the benefit of Indians, from whatever source derived.

        (3) __Direct cost base__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), the direct cost base of a tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year is the aggregate direct cost program funding for all tribal elementary or secondary educational programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization during—

                (i) the second fiscal year preceding such fiscal year; or

                (ii) if such programs have not been operated by the tribe or tribal organization during the 2 preceding fiscal years, the first fiscal year preceding such fiscal year.

            (B) __Functions not previously operated__ 

                In the case of Bureau elementary or secondary education functions which have not previously been operated by a tribe or tribal organization under contract, grant, or agreement with the Bureau, the direct cost base for the initial year shall be the projected aggregate direct cost program funding for all Bureau elementary and secondary functions to be operated by the tribe or tribal organization during that fiscal year.

        (4) __Maximum base rate__ 

            The term “maximum base rate” means 50 percent.

        (5) __Minimum base rate__ 

            The term “minimum base rate” means 11 percent.

        (6) __Standard direct cost base__ 

            The term “standard direct cost base” means $600,000.

        (7) __Tribal elementary or secondary educational programs__ 

            The term “tribal elementary or secondary educational programs” means all Bureau elementary and secondary functions, together with any other Bureau programs or portions of programs (excluding funds for social services that are appropriated to agencies other than the Bureau and are funded through the Bureau, funds for major subcontracts, construction, and other major capital expenditures, and unexpended funds carried over from prior years) which share common administrative cost functions, that are operated directly by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract, grant, or agreement with the Bureau.

    (b) __Grants; effect upon appropriated amounts__ 

        (1) __Grants__ 

        Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school or grant school in the amount determined under this section with respect to the tribe or tribal organization for the purpose of paying the administrative and indirect costs incurred in operating contract or grant schools, provided that no school operated as a stand-alone institution shall receive less than $200,000 per year for these purposes, in order to—

            (A) enable tribes and tribal organizations operating such schools, without reducing direct program services to the beneficiaries of the program, to provide all related administrative overhead services and operations necessary to meet the requirements of law and prudent management practice; and

            (B) carry out other necessary support functions which would otherwise be provided by the Secretary or other Federal officers or employees, from resources other than direct program funds, in support of comparable Bureau-operated programs.

        (2) __Effect upon appropriated amounts__ 

            Amounts appropriated to fund the grants provided under this section shall be in addition to, and shall not reduce, the amounts appropriated for the program being administered by the contract or grant school.

    (c) __Determination of grant amount__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The amount of the grant provided to each tribe or tribal organization under this section for each fiscal year shall be determined by applying the administrative cost percentage rate of the tribe or tribal organization to the aggregate of the Bureau elementary and secondary functions operated by the tribe or tribal organization for which funds are received from or through the Bureau.

        (2) __Direct cost base funds__ 

        The Secretary shall—

            (A) reduce the amount of the grant determined under paragraph (1) to the extent that payments for administrative costs are actually received by an Indian tribe or tribal organization under any Federal education program included in the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization; and

            (B) take such actions as may be necessary to be reimbursed by any other department or agency of the Federal Government for the portion of grants made under this section for the costs of administering any program for Indians that is funded by appropriations made to such other department or agency.

    (d) __Administrative cost percentage rate__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        For purposes of this section, the administrative cost percentage rate for a contract or grant school for a fiscal year is equal to the percentage determined by dividing—

            (A)

             the sum of—

                (i)

                 the amount equal to—

                    (I) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, multiplied by

                    (II) the minimum base rate; plus

                (ii)

                 the amount equal to—

                    (I) the standard direct cost base; multiplied by

                    (II) the maximum base rate; by

            (B)

             the sum of—

                (i) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year; plus

                (ii) the standard direct cost base.

        (2) __Rounding__ 

            The administrative cost percentage rate shall be determined to the 1⁄100 of a decimal point.

        (3) __Applicability__ 

            The administrative cost percentage rate determined under this subsection shall not apply to other programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization.

    (e) __Combining funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Funds received by a tribe or contract or grant school as grants under this section for tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be combined by the tribe or contract or grant school into a single administrative cost account without the necessity of maintaining separate funding source accounting.

        (2) __Indirect cost funds__ 

            Indirect cost funds for programs at the school which share common administrative services with tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be included in the administrative cost account described in paragraph (1).

    (f) __Availability of funds__ 

        Funds received as grants under this section with respect to tribal elementary or secondary education programs shall remain available to the contract or grant school without fiscal year limitation and without diminishing the amount of any grants otherwise payable to the school under this section for any fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year for which the grant is provided.

    (g) __Treatment of funds__ 

        Funds received as grants under this section for Bureau-funded programs operated by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract or agreement shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of indirect cost underrecovery and overrecovery determinations by any Federal agency for any other funds, from whatever source derived.

    (h) __Treatment of entity operating other programs__ 

    In applying this section and section 106 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450j–1][/us/usc/t25/s450j–1]\] with respect to an Indian tribe or tribal organization that—

        (1) receives funds under this section for administrative costs incurred in operating a contract or grant school or a school operated under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 \[[25 U.S.C. 2501][/us/usc/t25/s2501] et seq.\]; and

        (2) operates one or more other programs under a contract or grant provided under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\],

        the Secretary shall ensure that the Indian tribe or tribal organization is provided with the full amount of the administrative costs that are associated with operating the contract or grant school, and of the indirect costs, that are associated with all of such other programs, except that funds appropriated for implementation of this section shall be used only to supply the amount of the grant required to be provided by this section.

    (i) __Studies for determination of factors affecting costs; base rates limits; standard direct cost base; report to Congress__ 

        (1) __Studies__ 

        Not later than 120 days after January 8, 2002, the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs shall—

            (A) conduct such studies as may be needed to establish an empirical basis for determining relevant factors substantially affecting required administrative costs of tribal elementary and secondary education programs, using the formula set forth in subsection (c); and

            (B)

             conduct a study to determine—

                (i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs;

                (ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs; and

                (iii)

                 a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (d) will—

                    (I) be equal to the median between the maximum base rate and the minimum base rate; and

                    (II) ensure that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs closest to the size of the program.

        (2) __Guidelines__ 

        The studies required under paragraph (1) shall—

            (A)

             be conducted in full consultation (in accordance with [section 2011 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2011]) with—

                (i) the tribes and tribal organizations that are affected by the application of the formula set forth in subsection (c); and

                (ii) all national and regional Indian organizations of which such tribes and tribal organizations are typically members;

            (B) be conducted onsite with a representative statistical sample of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs under a contract entered into with a nationally reputable public accounting and business consulting firm;

            (C) take into account the availability of skilled labor commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found to substantially affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to ensure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;

            (D) identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and

            (E) identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.

        (3) __Consultation with Inspector General__ 

            In carrying out the studies required under this subsection, the Director shall obtain the input of, and afford an opportunity to participate to, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.

        (4) __Consideration of delivery of administrative services__ 

            Determinations described in paragraph (2)(C) shall be based on what is practicable at each location studied, given prudent management practice, irrespective of whether required administrative services were actually or fully delivered at these sites, or whether other services were delivered instead, during the period of the study.

        (5) __Report__ 

            Upon completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the studies, together with determinations based upon such studies that would affect the definitions set forth under subsection (e) that are used in the formula set forth in subsection (c).

        (6) __Projection of costs__ 

            The Secretary shall include in the Bureau’s justification for each appropriations request beginning in the first fiscal year after the completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), a projection of the overall costs associated with the formula set forth in subsection (c) for all tribal elementary or secondary education programs which the Secretary expects to be funded in the fiscal year for which the appropriations are sought.

        (7) __Determination of program size__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, the size of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs is determined by the aggregate direct cost program funding level for all Bureau-funded programs which share common administrative cost functions.

    (j) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary.

        (2) __Reductions__ 

            If the total amount of funds necessary to provide grants to tribes and tribal organizations in the amounts determined under subsection (c) for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of funds appropriated to carry out this section for such fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of each grant determined under subsection (c) for such fiscal year by an amount that bears the same relationship to such excess as the amount of such grants determined under subsection (c) bears to the total of all grants determined under subsection (c) section  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  for all tribes and tribal organizations for such fiscal year.

    (k) __Applicability to schools operating under Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988__ 

        The provisions of this section shall apply to schools operating under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 \[[25 U.S.C. 2501][/us/usc/t25/s2501] et seq.\].

    (l) __Administrative cost grant budget requests__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Beginning with President’s  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. Probably should be preceded by “the”. </sup></sup>  annual budget request under [section 1105 of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1105] for fiscal year 2002, and with respect to each succeeding budget request, at the discretion of the Secretary, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress information and funding requests for the full funding of administrative costs grants required to be paid under this section.

        (2) __Requirements__ 

            (A) __Funding for new conversions to contract or grant school operations__ 

                With respect to a budget request under paragraph (1), the amount required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization expected to begin operation of a Bureau-funded school as contract or grant school in the academic year funded by such annual budget request, the amount so required shall not be less than 10 percent of the amount required for subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Funding for continuing contract and grant school operations__ 

                With respect to a budget request under paragraph (1), the amount required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract or grant school at the time the annual budget request is submitted, which amount shall include the amount of funds required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization which began operation of a contract or grant school with administrative cost grant funds supplied from the amount described in subparagraph (A).
