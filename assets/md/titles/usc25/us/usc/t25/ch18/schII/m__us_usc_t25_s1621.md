    (c) __Allocation; use__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Funds appropriated under the authority of this section shall be allocated to Service units, Indian tribes, or tribal organizations. The funds allocated to each Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Service unit under this paragraph shall be used by the Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Service unit under this paragraph to improve the health status and reduce the resource deficiency of each Indian tribe served by such Service unit, Indian tribe, or tribal organization.

        (2) __Apportionment of allocated funds__ 

            The apportionment of funds allocated to a Service unit, Indian tribe, or tribal organization under paragraph (1) among the health service responsibilities described in subsection (a)(5) shall be determined by the Service in consultation with, and with the active participation of, the affected Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

    (d) __Provisions relating to health status and resource deficiencies__ 

    For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

        (1) __Definition__ 

        The term “health status and resource deficiency” means the extent to which—

            (A) the health status objectives set forth in sections 1602(1) and 1602(2) of this title are not being achieved; and

            (B) the Indian tribe or tribal organization does not have available to it the health resources it needs, taking into account the actual cost of providing health care services given local geographic, climatic, rural, or other circumstances.

        (2) __Available resources__ 

            The health resources available to an Indian tribe or tribal organization include health resources provided by the Service as well as health resources used by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, including services and financing systems provided by any Federal programs, private insurance, and programs of State or local governments.

        (3) __Process for review of determinations__ 

            The Secretary shall establish procedures which allow any Indian tribe or tribal organization to petition the Secretary for a review of any determination of the extent of the health status and resource deficiency of such Indian tribe or tribal organization.

    (e) __Eligibility for funds__ 

        Tribal health programs shall be eligible for funds appropriated under the authority of this section on an equal basis with programs that are administered directly by the Service.

    (f) __Report__ 

    By no later than the date that is 3 years after March 23, 2010, the Secretary shall submit to Congress the current health status and resource deficiency report of the Service for each Service unit, including newly recognized or acknowledged Indian tribes. Such report shall set out—

        (1) the methodology then in use by the Service for determining tribal health status and resource deficiencies, as well as the most recent application of that methodology;

        (2) the extent of the health status and resource deficiency of each Indian tribe served by the Service or a tribal health program;

            (B) the number of Indians eligible for health services in each Service unit or Indian tribe or tribal organization; and

            (C) the number of Indians using the Service resources made available to each Service unit, Indian tribe or tribal organization, and, to the extent available, information on the waiting lists and number of Indians turned away for services due to lack of resources.

    (g) __Inclusion in base budget__ 

        Funds appropriated under this section for any fiscal year shall be included in the base budget of the Service for the purpose of determining appropriations under this section in subsequent fiscal years.

    (h) __Clarification__ 

        Nothing in this section is intended to diminish the primary responsibility of the Service to eliminate existing backlogs in unmet health care needs, nor are the provisions of this section intended to discourage the Service from undertaking additional efforts to achieve equity among Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

    (i) __Funding designation__
