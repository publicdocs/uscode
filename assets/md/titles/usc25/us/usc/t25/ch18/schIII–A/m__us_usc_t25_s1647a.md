## § 1647a. Nondiscrimination under Federal health care programs in qualifications for reimbursement for services

    (a) __Requirement to satisfy generally applicable participation requirements__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A Federal health care program must accept an entity that is operated by the Service, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization as a provider eligible to receive payment under the program for health care services furnished to an Indian on the same basis as any other provider qualified to participate as a provider of health care services under the program if the entity meets generally applicable State or other requirements for participation as a provider of health care services under the program.

        (2) __Satisfaction of State or local licensure or recognition requirements__ 

            Any requirement for participation as a provider of health care services under a Federal health care program that an entity be licensed or recognized under the State or local law where the entity is located to furnish health care services shall be deemed to have been met in the case of an entity operated by the Service, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization if the entity meets all the applicable standards for such licensure or recognition, regardless of whether the entity obtains a license or other documentation under such State or local law. In accordance with [section 1621t of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1621t], the absence of the licensure of a health professional employed by such an entity under the State or local law where the entity is located shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the entity meets such standards, if the professional is licensed in another State.

    (b) __Application of exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs__ 

        (1) __Excluded entities__ 

            No entity operated by the Service, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization that has been excluded from participation in any Federal health care program or for which a license is under suspension or has been revoked by the State where the entity is located shall be eligible to receive payment or reimbursement under any such program for health care services furnished to an Indian.

        (2) __Excluded individuals__ 

            No individual who has been excluded from participation in any Federal health care program or whose State license is under suspension shall be eligible to receive payment or reimbursement under any such program for health care services furnished by that individual, directly or through an entity that is otherwise eligible to receive payment for health care services, to an Indian.

        (3) __Federal health care program defined__

The comma probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  “Federal health care program” has the meaning given that term in [section 1320a–7b(f) of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1320a–7b/f], except that, for purposes of this subsection, such term shall include the health insurance program under chapter 89 of title 5.
