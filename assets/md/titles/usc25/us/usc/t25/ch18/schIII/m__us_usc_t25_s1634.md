            (A) any plans or designs for such renovation or modernization; and

            (B) any renovation or modernization for which funds appropriated under any Federal law were lawfully expended,

            but only if the requirements of subsection (b) are met.

        (2) The Secretary shall maintain a separate priority list to address the needs of such facilities for personnel or equipment.

        (3) The Secretary shall submit to the President, for inclusion in each report required to be transmitted to the Congress under [section 1671 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1671], the priority list maintained pursuant to paragraph (2).

    (b) __Requirements__ 

    The requirements of this subsection are met with respect to any renovation or modernization if—

        (1)

         the tribe or tribal organization—

            (A) provides notice to the Secretary of its intent to renovate or modernize; and

            (B) applies to the Secretary to be placed on a separate priority list to address the needs of such new facilities for personnel or equipment; and

        (2)

         the renovation or modernization—

            (A) is approved by the appropriate area director of the Service; and

            (B) is administered by the tribe in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary with respect to construction or renovation of Service facilities.

    (c) __Recovery for non-use as Service facility__ 

        If any Service facility which has been renovated or modernized by an Indian tribe under this section ceases to be used as a Service facility during the 20-year period beginning on the date such renovation or modernization is completed, such Indian tribe shall be entitled to recover from the United States an amount which bears the same ratio to the value of such facility at the time of such cessation as the value of such renovation or modernization (less the total amount of any funds provided specifically for such facility under any Federal program that were expended for such renovation or modernization) bore to the value of such facility at the time of the completion of such renovation or modernization.
