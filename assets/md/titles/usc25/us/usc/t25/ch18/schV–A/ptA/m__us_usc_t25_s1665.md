## § 1665. Definitions

        The term “alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders” or “ARND” means, with a history of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, central nervous system abnormalities, which may range from minor intellectual deficits and developmental delays to mental retardation. ARND children may have behavioral problems, learning disabilities, problems with executive functioning, and attention disorders. The neurological defects of ARND may be as severe as FAS, but facial anomalies and other physical characteristics are not present in ARND, thus making diagnosis difficult.

    (2) __Assessment__

    (3) __Behavioral health aftercare__ 

        The term “behavioral health aftercare” includes those activities and resources used to support recovery following inpatient, residential, intensive substance abuse, or mental health outpatient or outpatient treatment. The purpose is to help prevent or deal with relapse by ensuring that by the time a client or patient is discharged from a level of care, such as outpatient treatment, an aftercare plan has been developed with the client. An aftercare plan may use such resources as a community-based therapeutic group, transitional living facilities, a 12-step sponsor, a local 12-step or other related support group, and other community-based providers.
