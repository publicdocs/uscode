([Pub. L. 94–437, title II][/us/pl/94/437/tII], § 211, as added [Pub. L. 102–573, title II][/us/pl/102/573/tII], § 206(c), Oct. 29, 1992, [106 Stat. 4549][/us/stat/106/4549]; amended [Pub. L. 104–313][/us/pl/104/313], § 2(c), Oct. 19, 1996, [110 Stat. 3822][/us/stat/110/3822]; [Pub. L. 111–148, title X][/us/pl/111/148/tX], § 10221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, [124 Stat. 935][/us/stat/124/935].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 1679 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1679], referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was repealed and a new section 1679 was enacted by [Pub. L. 111–148, title X][/us/pl/111/148/tX], § 10221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, [124 Stat. 935][/us/stat/124/935]. Provisions describing California Indians, similar to those that appeared in former section 1679(b) are now contained in new section 1679(a).

    [Section 1621a of this title][/us/usc/t25/s1621a], referred to in subsec. (f)(1), was amended generally by [Pub. L. 111–148, title X][/us/pl/111/148/tX], § 10221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, [124 Stat. 935][/us/stat/124/935], and, as so amended, no longer contains a subsec. (b)(2).

 __Codification__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148] is based on section 101(b)(3) of title I of S. 1790, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, as reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate in Dec. 2009, which was enacted into law by [section 10221(a) of Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148/s10221/a].

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (g). [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148] struck out subsec. (g) which authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2000.

    1996—Subsec. (g). [Pub. L. 104–313][/us/pl/104/313] substituted “1996 through 2000” for “1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997”.

 __Termination of Advisory Boards__ 

    Advisory boards established after Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of their establishment, unless, in the case of a board established by the President or an officer of the Federal Government, such board is renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a board established by Congress, its duration is otherwise provided by law. See sections 3(2) and 14 of [Pub. L. 92–463][/us/pl/92/463], Oct. 6, 1972, [86 Stat. 770][/us/stat/86/770], 776, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
