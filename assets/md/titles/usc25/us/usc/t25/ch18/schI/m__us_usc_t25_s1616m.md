    The recipient of a scholarship under subsection (b) shall agree, in providing health care pursuant to the requirements of subsection (d)(1)—

        (1) not to discriminate against an individual seeking such care on the basis of the ability of the individual to pay for such care or on the basis that payment for such care will be made pursuant to the program established in title XVIII of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1395][/us/usc/t42/s1395] et seq.\] or pursuant to the program established in title XIX of such Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1396][/us/usc/t42/s1396] et seq.\]; and
