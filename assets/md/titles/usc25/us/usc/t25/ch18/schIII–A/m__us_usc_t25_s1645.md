    (b) __Limitations__ 

    The Secretary shall not take any action under this section or under subchapter IV of chapter 81 of title 38 which would impair—

    “(e) The Secretary shall submit a final report at the end of fiscal year 1996, on the activities carried out under the demonstration program described in subsection (a) of this section which shall include an evaluation of whether such activities have fulfilled the objectives of such program. In such report the Secretary shall provide a recommendation, based upon the results of such demonstration program, as to whether direct billing of, and reimbursement by, the medicare and medicaid programs and other third-party payors should be authorized for all Indian tribes and Alaska Native health organizations which are contracting the entire operation of a facility of the Service.

    “(f) The Secretary shall provide for the retrocession of any contract entered into between a participant in the demonstration program described in subsection (a) of this section and the Service under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination Act.
