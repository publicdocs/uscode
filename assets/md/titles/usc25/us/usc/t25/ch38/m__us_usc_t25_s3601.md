    (1) there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and each Indian tribe;

    (2) the United States has a trust responsibility to each tribal government that includes the protection of the sovereignty of each tribal government;

    (3) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the exercise of administrative authorities, has recognized the self-determination, self-reliance, and inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes;

    (4) Indian tribes possess the inherent authority to establish their own form of government, including tribal justice systems;

    (5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve as important forums for ensuring public health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments;

    (6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights;

    (7) traditional tribal justice practices are essential to the maintenance of the culture and identity of Indian tribes and to the goals of this chapter;

    (8) tribal justice systems are inadequately funded, and the lack of adequate funding impairs their operation; and
