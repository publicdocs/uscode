            (B) land that is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe.

        (2) __Required consent__ 

            (A) __In general__

            (B) __Interest owned by tribe__ 

                Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining whether the consent requirement under subparagraph (A) has been met.

    (b) __Conditions applicable to purchase__ 

    Subsection (a) applies on the condition that—

        (1) any Indian owning any undivided interest, and in actual use and possession of such tract for at least three years preceding the tribal initiative, may purchase such tract by matching the tribal offer;

        (2) if at any time within five years following the date of acquisition of such land by an individual pursuant to this section, such property is offered for sale or a petition is filed with the Secretary for removal of the property from trust or restricted status, the tribe shall have 180 days from the date it is notified of such offer or petition to acquire such property by paying to the owner the fair market value as determined by the Secretary; and

        (3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a land sale initiated under this section, except that such approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a land consolidation plan that has been approved by the Secretary under [section 2203 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2203].

    (c) __Partition of highly fractionated Indian lands__ 

        (1) __Applicability__ 

            This subsection shall be applicable only to parcels of land (including surface and subsurface interests, except with respect to a subsurface interest that has been severed from the surface interest, in which case this subsection shall apply only to the surface interest) which the Secretary has determined, pursuant to paragraph (2)(B), <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be paragraph “(2)(C),”. </sup></sup>  to be parcels of highly fractionated Indian land.

        (2) __Requirements__ 

        Each partition action under this subsection shall be conducted by the Secretary in accordance with the following requirements:

            (A) __Application__ 

            Upon receipt of any payment or bond required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall commence a process for partitioning a parcel of land by sale in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon receipt of an application by—

                (i) the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the subject land that owns an undivided interest in the parcel of land; or

                (ii) any person owning an undivided interest in the parcel of land who is eligible to bid at the sale of the parcel pursuant to subclause (II), (III), or (IV) of subparagraph (I)(i);

                provided that no such application shall be valid or considered if it is received by the Secretary prior to the date that is 1 year after the date on which notice is published pursuant to section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004.

            (B) __Costs of serving notice and publication__ 

                The costs of serving and publishing notice under subparagraph (F) shall be borne by the applicant. Upon receiving written notice from the Secretary, the applicant must pay to the Secretary an amount determined by the Secretary to be the estimated costs of such service of notice and publication, or furnish a sufficient bond for such estimated costs within the time stated in the notice, failing which, unless an extension is granted by the Secretary, the Secretary shall not be required to commence the partition process under subparagraph (A) and may deny the application. The Secretary shall have the discretion and authority in any case to waive either the payment or the bond (or any portion of such payment or bond) otherwise required by this subparagraph, upon making a determination that such waiver will further the policies of this chapter.

            (C) __Determination__ 

                Upon receipt of an application pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall determine whether the subject parcel meets the requirements set forth in [section 2201(6) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2201/6] to be classified as a parcel of highly fractionated Indian land.

            (D) __Consent requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                A parcel of land may be partitioned under this subsection only if the applicant obtains the written consent of—

                    (II)

                     any owner who, for the 3-year period immediately preceding the date on which the Secretary receives the application, has

                        (aa) continuously maintained a bona fide residence on the parcel; or

                    (III) the owners (including parents of minor owners and legal guardians of incompetent owners) of at least 50 percent of the undivided interests in the parcel, but only in cases where the Secretary determines that, based on the final appraisal prepared pursuant to subparagraph (F), any 1 owner’s total undivided interest in the parcel (not including the interest of an Indian tribe or that of the owner requesting the partition) has a value in excess of $1,500.

                 Any consent required by this clause must be in writing and acknowledged before a notary public (or other official authorized to make acknowledgments), and shall be approved by the Secretary unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the consent was obtained as a result of fraud or undue influence.

                (ii) __Consent by the Secretary on behalf of certain individuals__ 

                For the purposes of clause (i)(III), the Secretary may consent on behalf of—

                    (I) undetermined heirs of trust or restricted interests and owners of such interests who are minors and legal incompetents having no parents or legal guardian; and

For purposes of this subsection, owners shall be determined from the Secretary’s land title records as of the date of the determination under subparagraph (C) or a date that is not more than 90 days prior to the date of mailing under this clause, whichever is later. In the event the written notice to an owner is returned undelivered, the Secretary shall attempt to obtain a current address for such owner by conducting a reasonable search (including a reasonable search of records maintained by local, State, Federal and tribal governments and agencies) and by inquiring with the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the subject parcel, and, if different from that tribe, the Indian tribe of which the owner is a member, and, if successful in locating any such owner, send written notice by certified mail in accordance with this subclause.

                        (bb) equal to or greater than 20 percent of the entire undivided ownership of the parcel;

                    (III) within 3 days following the date of the auction or for receiving sealed bids, and in accordance with the regulations adopted to implement this section (if any), the owner delivers to the Secretary a written notice of intent to exercise the owner’s rights under this clause; and

            (K) __Lack of bids or consent__ 

                (i) __Lack of bids__ 

                If no bidder described in subparagraph (I) presents a bid that equals or exceeds the final appraised value, the Secretary may either—

                    (I) purchase the parcel of land for its appraised fair market value on behalf of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land, subject to the lien and procedures provided under [section 2213(b) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2213/b]; or

                    (II) terminate the partition process.

                (ii) __Lack of consent__

            (A) __In general__ 

            If a partition is approved under this subsection and an owner of an interest in the parcel of land refuses to surrender possession in accordance with the partition decision, or refuses to execute any conveyance necessary to implement the partition, then any affected owner or the United States may—
