## § 2205. Tribal probate codes; acquisitions of fractional interests by tribes

    (a) __Tribal probate codes__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Indian tribe may adopt a tribal probate code to govern descent and distribution of trust or restricted lands that are—

            (A) located within that Indian tribe’s reservation; or

            (B) otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of that Indian tribe.

        (2) __Possible inclusions__ 

        A tribal probate code referred to in paragraph (1) may include—

            (A) rules of intestate succession; and

            (B) other tribal probate code provisions that are consistent with Federal law and that promote the policies set forth in section 102 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000.

        (3) __Tribal probate codes__ 

        Except as provided in any applicable Federal law, the Secretary shall not approve a tribal probate code, or an amendment to such a code, that prohibits the devise of an interest in trust or restricted land to—

            (A) an Indian lineal descendant of the original allottee; or

            (B) an Indian who is not a member of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over such an interest;

            unless the code provides for—

            (i) the renouncing of interests to eligible devisees in accordance with the code;

            (ii) the opportunity for a devisee who is the spouse or lineal descendant of a testator to reserve a life estate without regard to waste; and

            (iii) payment of fair market value in the manner prescribed under subsection (c)(2).

    (b) __Secretarial approval__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Any tribal probate code enacted under subsection (a), and any amendment to such a tribal probate code, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary.

        (2) __Review and approval__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Each Indian tribe that adopts a tribal probate code under subsection (a) shall submit that code to the Secretary for review. Not later than 180 days after a tribal probate code is submitted to the Secretary under this paragraph, the Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove that tribal probate code.

            (B) __Consequence of failures to approve or disapprove a tribal probate code__ 

                If the Secretary fails to approve or disapprove a tribal probate code submitted for review under subparagraph (A) by the date specified in that subparagraph, the tribal probate code shall be deemed to have been approved by the Secretary, but only to the extent that the tribal probate code is consistent with Federal law and promotes the policies set forth in section 102 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000.

            (C) __Consistency of tribal probate code with chapter__ 

                The Secretary may not approve a tribal probate code, or any amendment to such a code, under this paragraph unless the Secretary determines that the tribal probate code promotes the policies set forth in section 102 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000.

            (D) __Explanation__ 

                If the Secretary disapproves a tribal probate code, or an amendment to such a code, under this paragraph, the Secretary shall include in the notice of disapproval to the Indian tribe a written explanation of the reasons for the disapproval.

            (E) __Amendments__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Each Indian tribe that amends a tribal probate code under this paragraph shall submit the amendment to the Secretary for review and approval. Not later than 60 days after receiving an amendment under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove the amendment.

                (ii) __Consequence of failure to approve or disapprove an amendment__ 

                    If the Secretary fails to approve or disapprove an amendment submitted under clause (i), the amendment shall be deemed to have been approved by the Secretary, but only to the extent that the amendment is consistent with Federal law and promotes the policies set forth in section 102 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by “Amendments”. </sup></sup>  of 2000.

        (3) __Effective dates__ 

        A tribal probate code approved under paragraph (2) shall become effective on the later of—

            (A) the date that is 1 year after the date on which the Secretary makes the certification required under section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004 ([25 U.S.C. 2201][/us/usc/t25/s2201] note; [Public Law 108–374][/us/pl/108/374]); or

            (B) 180 days after the date of approval.

        (4) __Limitations__

            (A) not become effective earlier than the date that is 180 days after the Secretary receives notice of the repeal; and

    (c) __Authority available to Indian tribes__ 

        (1) __Authority__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                If the owner of an interest in trust or restricted land devises an interest in such land to a non-Indian under [section 2206(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2206/b/2/A/ii], the Indian tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the parcel of land involved may acquire such interest by paying to the Secretary the fair market value of such interest, as determined by the Secretary on the date of the decedent’s death.

            (B) __Transfer__ 

                The Secretary shall transfer payments received under subparagraph (A) to any person or persons who would have received an interest in land if the interest had not been acquired by the Indian tribe in accordance with this paragraph.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            (A) __Inapplicability to certain interests__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an interest in trust or restricted land if—

                    (I) while the decedent’s estate is pending before the Secretary, the non-Indian devisee renounces the interest in favor of an Indian person; or

                    (II)

                        (aa) the interest is part of a family farm that is devised to a member of the family of the decedent; and

                        (bb) the devisee agrees in writing that the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land will have the opportunity to acquire the interest for fair market value if the interest is offered for sale to a person or entity that is not a member of the family of the owner of the land.

                (ii) __Recording of interest__ 

                    On request by the Indian tribe described in clause (i)(II)(bb), a restriction relating to the acquisition by the Indian tribe of an interest in a family farm involved shall be recorded as part of the deed relating to the interest involved.

                (iii) __Mortgage and foreclosure__ 

                Nothing in clause (i)(II) limits—

                    (I) the ability of an owner of land to which that clause applies to mortgage the land; or

                    (II) the right of the entity holding such a mortgage to foreclose or otherwise enforce such a mortgage agreement in accordance with applicable law.

                (iv) __Definition of “member of the family”__ 

                In this paragraph, the term “member of the family”, with respect to a decedent or landowner, means—

                    (I) a lineal descendant of a decedent or landowner;

                    (II) a lineal descendant of the grandparent of a decedent or landowner;

                    (III) the spouse of a descendant or landowner described in subclause (I) or (II); and

            (B) __Reservation of life estate__ 

                A non-Indian devisee described in paragraph (1), may retain a life estate in the interest involved, including a life estate to the revenue produced from the interest. The amount of any payment required under paragraph (1) shall be reduced to reflect the value of any life estate reserved by a non-Indian devisee under this subparagraph.

        (3) __Payments__ 

        With respect to payments by an Indian tribe under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

            (A) upon the request of the tribe, allow a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 2 years, for the tribe to make payments of amounts due pursuant to paragraph (1); or

            (B) recognize alternative agreed upon exchanges of consideration or extended payment terms between the non-Indian devisee described in paragraph (1) and the tribe in satisfaction of the payment under paragraph (1).

    (d) __Use of proposed findings by tribal justice systems__ 

        (1) __Tribal justice system defined__ 

            In this subsection, the term “tribal justice system” has the meaning given that term in [section 3602 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s3602].

        (2) __Regulations__
