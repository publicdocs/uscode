## § 2219. Application to Alaska

    (a) __Findings__ 

    Congress finds that—

        (1) numerous academic and governmental organizations have studied the nature and extent of fractionated ownership of Indian land outside of Alaska and have proposed solutions to this problem; and

        (2) despite these studies, there has not been a comparable effort to analyze the problem, if any, of fractionated ownership in Alaska.

    (b) __Application of chapter to Alaska__ 

        Except as provided in this section, this chapter shall not apply to land located within Alaska.

    (c) __Rule of construction__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a ratification of any determination by any agency, instrumentality, or court of the United States that may support the assertion of tribal jurisdiction over allotment lands or interests in such land in Alaska.

([Pub. L. 97–459, title II][/us/pl/97/459/tII], § 220, as added [Pub. L. 106–462, title I][/us/pl/106/462/tI], § 103(6), Nov. 7, 2000, [114 Stat. 2006][/us/stat/114/2006].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “this Act”, which was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title II of [Pub. L. 97–459][/us/pl/97/459], to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
