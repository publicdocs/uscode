                (i) the sale or exchange or conveyance of an interest in trust or restricted land may be made for an amount that is less than the fair market value of that interest; and

                (ii) the approval of a transaction that is in compliance with this section shall not constitute a breach of trust by the Secretary.

            (B) __Waiver of requirement__ 

            The requirement for an estimate of value under subparagraph (A) may be waived in writing by an owner of a trust or restricted interest in land either selling, exchanging, or conveying by gift deed for no or nominal consideration such interest—

                (i) to an Indian person who is the owner’s spouse, brother, sister, lineal ancestor, lineal descendant, or collateral heir; or

                (ii) to an Indian co-owner or to the tribe with jurisdiction over the subject parcel of land, where the grantor owns a fractional interest that represents 5 percent or less of the parcel.

        (2) __Limitation__ 

            For a period of 5 years after the Secretary approves a conveyance pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not approve an application to terminate the trust status or remove the restrictions of such an interest.

    (c) __Acquisition of interest by Secretary__ 

        An Indian, or the recognized tribal government of a reservation, in possession of an interest in trust or restricted lands, at least a portion of which is in trust or restricted status on November 7, 2000, and located within a reservation, may request that the interest be taken into trust by the Secretary. Upon such a request, the Secretary shall forthwith take such interest into trust.

    (d) __Status of lands__ 

        The sale, exchange, or conveyance by gift deed for no or nominal consideration of an interest in trust or restricted land under this section shall not affect the status of that land as trust or restricted land.

    (e) __Land ownership information__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the names and mailing addresses of the owners of any interest in trust or restricted lands, and information on the location of the parcel and the percentage of undivided interest owned by each individual shall, upon written request, be made available to—

        (1) other owners of interests in trust or restricted lands within the same reservation;

        (2) the tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the land where the parcel is located or any person who is eligible for membership in that tribe; and

        (3) any person that is leasing, using, or consolidating, or is applying to lease, use, or consolidate, such trust or restricted land or the interest in trust or restricted lands.

    (f) __Purchase of land by Indian tribe__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), before the Secretary approves an application to terminate the trust status or remove the restrictions on alienation from a parcel of, or interest in, trust or restricted land, the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the parcel shall have the opportunity—

            (A) to match any offer contained in the application; or

            (B) in a case in which there is no purchase price offered, to acquire the interest in the parcel by paying the fair market value of the interest.

        (2) __Exception for family farms__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a parcel of, or interest in, trust or restricted land that is part of a family farm that is conveyed to a member of the family of a landowner (as defined in [section 2205(c)(2)(A)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2205/c/2/A/iv]) if the conveyance requires that in the event that the parcel or interest is offered for sale to an entity or person that is not a member of the family of the landowner, the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land shall be afforded the opportunity to purchase the interest pursuant to paragraph (1).
