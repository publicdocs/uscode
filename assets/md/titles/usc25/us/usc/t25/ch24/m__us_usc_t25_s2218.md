## § 2218. Approval of leases, rights-of-way, and sales of natural resources

    (a) __Approval by the Secretary__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may approve any lease or agreement that affects individually owned allotted land or any other land held in trust or restricted status by the Secretary on behalf of an Indian, if—

            (A) the owners of not less than the applicable percentage (determined under subsection (b)) of the undivided interest in the allotted land that is covered by the lease or agreement consent in writing to the lease or agreement; and

            (B) the Secretary determines that approving the lease or agreement is in the best interest of the owners of the undivided interest in the allotted land.

        (2) __Rule of construction__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to leases involving coal or uranium.

        (3) __Definition__ 

            In this section, the term “allotted land” includes any land held in trust or restricted status by the Secretary on behalf of one or more Indians.

    (b) __Applicable percentage__ 

        (1) __Percentage interest__ 

        The applicable percentage referred to in subsection (a)(1) shall be determined as follows:

            (A) If there are 5 or fewer owners of the undivided interest in the allotted land, the applicable percentage shall be 90 percent.

        (2) __Determination of owners__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                For purposes of this subsection, in determining the number of owners of, and their interests in, the undivided interest in the allotted land with respect to a lease or agreement, the Secretary shall make such determination based on the records of the Department of the Interior that identify the owners of such lands and their interests and the number of owners of such land on the date on which the lease or agreement involved is submitted to the Secretary under this section.

            (B) __Rule of construction__ 

                Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to treat an Indian tribe as the owner of an interest in allotted land that did not escheat to the tribe pursuant to [section 2206 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s2206] as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period. </sup></sup>  Ct. 727 (1997)).

        (1) __Application to all parties__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subject to paragraph (2), a lease or agreement approved by the Secretary under subsection (a) shall be binding on the parties described in subparagraph (B), to the same extent as if all of the owners of the undivided interest in allotted land covered under the lease or agreement consented to the lease or agreement.

            (B) __Description of parties__ 

            The parties referred to in subparagraph (A) are—

                (i) the owners of the undivided interest in the allotted land covered under the lease or agreement referred to in such subparagraph; and

                (ii) all other parties to the lease or agreement.

        (2) __Tribe not treated as party to lease; no effect on tribal sovereignty, immunity__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Subparagraph (B) shall apply with respect to any undivided interest in allotted land held by the Secretary in trust for a tribe if a lease or agreement under subsection (a) is otherwise applicable to such undivided interest by reason of this section even though the Indian tribe did not consent to the lease or agreement.
