## § 3302. Findings

The Congress finds that—

    (1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;

    (2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;

    (3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;

    (4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;

    (5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;

    (6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and

    (7) these services are part of the Federal Government’s continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.
