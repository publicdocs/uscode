## § 3304. Qualification for grants to tribes

    (a) __Contracting tribes__ 

        Any Indian tribe that obtains funds for educational purposes similar to those authorized in this subchapter pursuant to contract under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\] may qualify for a grant under this subchapter by submitting to the Secretary a notice of intent to administer a student assistance program under [section 3303 of this title][/us/usc/t25/s3303]. Such notice shall be effective for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is submitted, except that if such notice is submitted during the last 90 days of a fiscal year such notice shall be effective the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is submitted, unless the Secretary waives this limitation.

    (b) __Noncontracting tribes__ 

    Any Indian tribe that is not eligible to qualify for a grant under this subchapter by filing a notice under subsection (a) may qualify for such a grant by filing an application for such a grant. Such application shall be submitted under guidelines for programs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\], as in effect on January 1, 1991, and shall be reviewed under the standards, practices, and procedures applicable to applications to contract under such Act as in effect on the date the application is received, except that—

        (1) if the tribe is not notified that its application has been disapproved within 180 days after it is filed with the Secretary, the application shall be deemed to be approved;

        (2) if the application is disapproved, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance to the tribe for purposes of correcting deficiencies in the application;

        (3) the Secretary shall designate an office or official to receive such applications, and shall toll the 180-day period described in paragraph (1) from the date of receipt by such office or official; and

        (4) applications shall be approved for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which submitted, unless the Secretary waives the limitation of this paragraph.

    (c) __Termination of grants__ 

        (1) __Continuing eligibility presumed__ 

            An Indian tribe which has qualified under subsection (a) or (b) for a grant under this subchapter for any fiscal year shall continue to be eligible for such a grant for each succeeding fiscal year unless the Secretary revokes such eligibility for a cause described in paragraph (2).

        (2) __Causes for loss of eligibility__ 

        The Secretary may revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter if such tribe—

            (A) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual financial statement that reports revenues and expenditures determined by use of an accounting system, established by the tribe, that complies with generally accepted accounting principles;

            (B) fails to submit to the Bureau an annual program description, stating the number of students served, and containing such information concerning such students, their educational programs and progress, and the financial assistance distributed to such students as the Secretary may require by regulation;

            (C) fails to submit to the Secretary a biennial financial audit conducted in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31; or

            (D) fails, in an evaluation of its financial assistance program conducted by an impartial third party entity, to comply with standards under this subchapter relating to (i) eligible students, programs, or institutions of higher education, (ii) satisfactory progress, or (iii) allowable administrative costs; as determined under contracts applicable to programs to provide financial assistance to individual Indian students for the cost of attendance at institutions of higher education administered by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\] and in effect on January 20, 1991.

        (3) __Procedures for revocation of eligibility__ 

        The Secretary shall not revoke the eligibility of an Indian tribe for a grant under this subchapter except—

            (A) after notice in writing to the tribe of the cause and opportunity to the tribe to correct;

            (B) providing technical assistance to the tribe in making such corrections; and

            (C) after hearing and appeals conducted under the same rules and regulations that apply to similar termination actions under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \[[25 U.S.C. 450][/us/usc/t25/s450] et seq.\].
