([Pub. L. 101–379, § 5][/us/pl/101/379/s5], Aug. 18, 1990, [104 Stat. 476][/us/stat/104/476]; [Pub. L. 111–211, title II, § 231(b)][/us/pl/111/211/s231/b], (e), July 29, 2010, [124 Stat. 2273][/us/stat/124/2273], 2278.)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 458ccc–1(a) of this title][/us/usc/t25/s458ccc–1/a], referred to in subsec. (g)(2), was in the original “section 701(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act”, and was translated as reading “section 702(a) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act”, meaning [section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93–638][/us/pl/93/638/s702/a], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 93–638][/us/pl/93/638] does not contain a section 701(a), and [section 702(a) of Pub. L. 93–638][/us/pl/93/638/s702/a] relates to establishment of the Indian Law Enforcement Foundation.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 111–211, § 231(b)][/us/pl/111/211/s231/b], inserted heading, designated first sentence as par. (1), inserted par.
