Half-way houses may be used as either intake facilities or aftercare facilities for youth admitted, or to be admitted, for long-term treatment of substance abuse. The Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the tribes are authorized to use their respective resources to adequately staff and operate any such facility.

    (b) __Referrals__

        (2) In any case where there is a space available in an appropriately licensed and supervised emergency shelter or half-way house, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal courts are encouraged to refer Indian youth convicted of offenses directly or indirectly related to alcohol and substance abuse to such facilities in lieu of sentencing to incarceration in a secured juvenile facility.

    (c) __Direction to States__

        (1) place any Indian youth arrested for any offense related to alcohol or substance abuse in a temporary emergency shelter described in subsection (d) or a community-based alcohol or substance abuse treatment facility in lieu of incarceration to the extent such facilities are available, and

        (2) observe the standards promulgated under subsection (d).

        (4)
