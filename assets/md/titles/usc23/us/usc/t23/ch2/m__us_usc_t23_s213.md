        (2) __Calculation of national amount.—__ 

        The Secretary shall determine an amount for each fiscal year that is equal to 2 percent of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) to carry out chapters 1, 2, 5, and 6 of this title.

            (B) __Other factors.—__

        (4) __Access to funds.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

            Each State or metropolitan planning organization required to obligate funds in accordance with paragraph (1) shall develop a competitive process to allow eligible entities to submit projects for funding that achieve the objectives of this subsection.
