## § 167. National highway freight program

    (a) __In General.—__ 

        (1)  __Policy__  __.—__ 

        It is the policy of the United States to improve the condition and performance of the National Highway Freight Network established under this section to ensure that the Network provides the foundation for the United States to compete in the global economy and achieve the goals described in subsection (b).

        (2)  __Establishment__  __.—__ 

        In support of the goals described in subsection (b), the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration shall establish a national highway freight program in accordance with this section to improve the efficient movement of freight on the National Highway Freight Network.

    (b)  __Goals__  __.—__ 

    The goals of the national highway freight program are—

        (1)

         to invest in infrastructure improvements and to implement operational improvements on the highways of the United States that—

            (A) strengthen the contribution of the National Highway Freight Network to the economic competitiveness of the United States;

            (B) reduce congestion and bottlenecks on the National Highway Freight Network;

            (C) reduce the cost of freight transportation;

            (D) improve the year-round reliability of freight transportation; and

            (E) increase productivity, particularly for domestic industries and businesses that create high-value jobs;

        (2) to improve the safety, security, efficiency, and resiliency of freight transportation in rural and urban areas;

        (3) to improve the state of good repair of the National Highway Freight Network;

        (4) to use innovation and advanced technology to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the National Highway Freight Network;

        (5) to improve the efficiency and productivity of the National Highway Freight Network;

        (6) to improve the flexibility of States to support multi-State corridor planning and the creation of multi-State organizations to increase the ability of States to address highway freight connectivity; and

        (7) to reduce the environmental impacts of freight movement on the National Highway Freight Network.

    (c) __Establishment of National Highway Freight Network.—__
