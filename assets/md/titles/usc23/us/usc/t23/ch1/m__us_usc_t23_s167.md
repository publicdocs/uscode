## § 167. National freight policy

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    It is the policy of the United States to improve the condition and performance of the national freight network to ensure that the national freight network provides the foundation for the United States to compete in the global economy and achieve each goal described in subsection (b).

    (b)  __Goals__  __.—__ 

    The goals of the national freight policy are—

        (1)

         to invest in infrastructure improvements and to implement operational improvements that—

            (A) strengthen the contribution of the national freight network to the economic competitiveness of the United States;

            (B) reduce congestion; and

            (C) increase productivity, particularly for domestic industries and businesses that create high-value jobs;

        (2) to improve the safety, security, and resilience of freight transportation;

        (3) to improve the state of good repair of the national freight network;

        (4) to use advanced technology to improve the safety and efficiency of the national freight network;

        (5) to incorporate concepts of performance, innovation, competition, and accountability into the operation and maintenance of the national freight network; and  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup> 

        (6) to improve the economic efficiency of the national freight network.1

        (7) to reduce the environmental impacts of freight movement on the national freight network; 1

    (c) __Establishment of a National Freight Network.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall establish a national freight network in accordance with this section to assist States in strategically directing resources toward improved system performance for efficient movement of freight on highways, including national highway system, freight intermodal connectors and aerotropolis transportation systems.

        (2)  __Network components__  __.—__ 

        The national freight network shall consist of—

        (2) provides access to energy exploration, development, installation, or production areas;

        (3)

         connects the primary freight network, a roadway described in paragraph (1) or (2), or Interstate System to facilities that handle more than—

                (i) methodologies for systematic analysis of benefits and costs;

                (ii) tools for ensuring that the evaluation of freight-related and other transportation projects could consider safety, economic competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and system condition in the project selection process; and

                (iii) other elements to assist in effective transportation planning;

            (B) identify transportation-related model data elements to support a broad range of evaluation methods and techniques to assist in making transportation investment decisions; and

            (C) at a minimum, in consultation with other relevant Federal agencies, consider any improvements to existing freight flow data collection efforts that could reduce identified freight data gaps and deficiencies and help improve forecasts of freight transportation demand.

        (2)  __Consultation__  __.—__
