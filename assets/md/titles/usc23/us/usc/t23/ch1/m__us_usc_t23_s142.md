        (1) For all purposes of this title, a project authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be deemed to be a highway project.

        (2) Projects authorized by subsection (a)(2) shall be subject to, and governed in accordance with, all provisions of this title applicable to projects on the surface transportation program, except to the extent determined inconsistent by the Secretary.

    (g) The provision of assistance under subsection (a)(2) shall not be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code, any non-supervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable.

    (h) Funds available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be supplementary to and not in substitution for funds authorized and available for obligation pursuant to chapter 53 of title 49.
