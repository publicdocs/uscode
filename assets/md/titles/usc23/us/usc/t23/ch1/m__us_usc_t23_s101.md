        Congress declares that it is in the national interest to accelerate the construction of Federal-aid highway systems, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be “Defense Highways,”. </sup></sup>  because many of the highways (or portions of the highways) are inadequate to meet the needs of local and interstate commerce for the national and civil defense.

        (2)  __Completion of interstate system__  __.—__ 

        Congress declares that the prompt and early completion of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (referred to in this section as the “Interstate System”), so named because of its primary importance to the national defense, is essential to the national interest. It is the intent of Congress that the Interstate System be completed as nearly as practicable over the period of availability of the forty years’ appropriations authorized for the purpose of expediting its construction, reconstruction, or improvement, inclusive of necessary tunnels and bridges, through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 ([70 Stat. 374][/us/stat/70/374]), and that the entire system in all States be brought to simultaneous completion. Insofar as possible in consonance with this objective, existing highways located on an interstate route shall be used to the extent that such use is practicable, suitable, and feasible, it being the intent that local needs, to the extent practicable, suitable, and feasible, shall be given equal consideration with the needs of interstate commerce.

        (3)  __Transportation needs of 21st century__  __.—__ 

        Congress declares that—

            (A) it is in the national interest to preserve and enhance the surface transportation system to meet the needs of the United States for the 21st Century;

            (B) the current urban and long distance personal travel and freight movement demands have surpassed the original forecasts and travel demand patterns are expected to continue to change;

            (C) continued planning for and investment in surface transportation is critical to ensure the surface transportation system adequately meets the changing travel demands of the future;

            (D)

             among the foremost needs that the surface transportation system must meet to provide for a strong and vigorous national economy are safe, efficient, and reliable—

                (i) national and interregional personal mobility (including personal mobility in rural and urban areas) and reduced congestion;

                (ii) flow of interstate and international commerce and freight transportation; and

                (iii) travel movements essential for national security;

            (E) special emphasis should be devoted to providing safe and efficient access for the type and size of commercial and military vehicles that access designated National Highway System intermodal freight terminals;

            (F) the connection between land use and infrastructure is significant;

            (G) transportation should play a significant role in promoting economic growth, improving the environment, and sustaining the quality of life; and

            (H) the Secretary should take appropriate actions to preserve and enhance the Interstate System to meet the needs of the 21st Century.

        (4)  __Expedited project delivery__  __.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Congress declares that it is in the national interest to expedite the delivery of surface transportation projects by substantially reducing the average length of the environmental review process.

            (B)  __Policy of the united states__  __.—__ 

            Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that—

                (i) the Secretary shall have the lead role among Federal agencies in carrying out the environmental review process for surface transportation projects;

                (ii) each Federal agency shall cooperate with the Secretary to expedite the environmental review process for surface transportation projects;

                (iii) project sponsors shall not be prohibited from carrying out preconstruction project development activities concurrently with the environmental review process;

                (iv) programmatic approaches shall be used to reduce the need for project-by-project reviews and decisions by Federal agencies; and

                (v) the Secretary shall identify opportunities for project sponsors to assume responsibilities of the Secretary where such responsibilities can be assumed in a manner that protects public health, the environment, and public participation.

    (c) It is the sense of Congress that under existing law no part of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any Federal-aid highway which has been apportioned pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be impounded or withheld from obligation, for purposes and projects as provided in this title, by any officer or employee in the executive branch of the Federal Government, except such specific sums as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, are necessary to be withheld from obligation for specific periods of time to assure that sufficient amounts will be available in the Highway Trust Fund to defray the expenditures which will be required to be made from such fund.

    (d) No funds authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund shall be expended by or on behalf of any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality other than the Federal Highway Administration unless funds for such expenditure are identified and included as a line item in an appropriation Act and are to meet obligations of the United States heretofore or hereafter incurred under this title attributable to the construction of Federal-aid highways or highway planning, research, or development, or as otherwise specifically authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund by Federal-aid highway legislation.

    (e) It is the national policy that to the maximum extent possible the procedures to be utilized by the Secretary and all other affected heads of Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities for carrying out this title and any other provision of law relating to the Federal highway programs shall encourage the substantial minimization of paperwork and interagency decision procedures and the best use of available manpower and funds so as to prevent needless duplication and unnecessary delays at all levels of government.

Beginning with funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1980, no such funds shall be available for projects to expand or clear zones immediately adjacent to the paved roadway of routes designed prior to February, 1967. Effective on and after the date of enactment of this sentence \[Dec. 29, 1981\], the obligation of funds authorized by this subsection, except for advance construction interstate projects approved before the date of enactment of this sentence, shall be limited to the construction necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate System which shall consist of (1) full access control; (2) a pavement design to accommodate the types and volumes of traffic anticipated for the twenty-year period from date of authorization of the initial basic construction contract; (3) essential environmental requirements; (4) a design of not more than six lanes (exclusive of high occupancy vehicle lanes) in rural areas and all urbanized areas under four hundred thousand population, and up to eight lanes (exclusive of high occupancy vehicle lanes) in urbanized areas of four hundred thousand population or more as shown in the 1980 Federal census; and (5) those high occupancy vehicle lanes (including approaches and all directly related facilities) included in the interstate cost estimate for fiscal year 1981.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any other provision of this subsection, where a project is to be constructed (1) to provide parking garage ramps in conjunction with high occupancy vehicle lanes which flow into a distributor system emptying directly into ramps for off-street parking with preferential parking for carpools, vanpools, and buses and the ramps are part of an environmental mitigation effort and are designed to feed into an aerial walkway system, or (2) to provide a parking lot near the terminus of an Interstate System spur route which radiates from an Interstate System beltway which will be used as an intermodal transfer facility for a light rail transit project to be constructed in the median of the spur route and the parking lot is part of an environmental mitigation effort, or (3) to provide a parking garage and associated facilities as part of an intermodal transfer facility with a transit system near or within an Interstate System route right-of-way which will have direct and indirect access to the facility by way of local streets and the parking garage and associated facilities are part of an environmental mitigation effort, or (4) to provide for the comprehensive upgrading of existing high occupancy vehicle lanes, new ramps and parking facilities at mass transit intermodal transfer points on an existing Interstate System route which has temporary high occupancy vehicle lanes in the median and the parking facilities and ramps are part of an environmental mitigation effort, the costs of such parking garage ramps, parking lots, parking garages, associated interchange ramps, high occupancy vehicle lanes, and other associated work eligible under title 23, United States Code, shall be eligible for funds authorized by this subsection as if the costs for these projects were included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be included as eligible projects in any future interstate cost estimate. For purposes of this subsection, construction necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate System shall include, but not be limited to, any construction on the Interstate System which is required under a court order issued before the date of enactment of this sentence. Notwithstanding the fifth sentence of this subsection, the costs of a project which will upgrade an interstate route and will complete a gap on the Interstate System providing access to an international airport and which was described as the preferred alternative in a final environmental impact statement submitted to the Secretary of Transportation on September 30, 1983, shall be eligible for funds authorized by this subsection as if such costs were included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be included as eligible costs in any future interstate cost estimate, except that (1) such costs may be further developed in the design and environmental process under normal Federal-aid interstate procedures, and (2) the amount of such costs shall not include the portion of the project between High Street and Causeway Street.”
