## § 114. Construction

    (a)  __Construction Work In General__  __.—__ 

    The construction of any Federal-aid highway or a portion of a Federal-aid highway shall be undertaken by the respective State transportation departments or under their direct supervision. The Secretary shall have the right to conduct such inspections and take such corrective action as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. The construction work and labor in each State shall be performed under the direct supervision of the State transportation department and in accordance with the laws of that State and applicable Federal laws. Construction may be begun as soon as funds are available for expenditure pursuant to subsection (a) of [section 118 of this title][/us/usc/t23/s118]. After July 1, 1973, the State transportation department shall not erect on any proj­ect where actual construction is in progress and visible to highway users any informational signs other than official traffic control devices conforming with standards developed by the Secretary of Transportation.

    (b) __Convict Labor and Convict Produced Materials.—__ 

        (1)  __Limitation on convict labor__  __.—__ 

        Convict labor shall not be used in construction of Federal-aid highways or portions of Federal-aid highways unless the labor is performed by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or probation.

        (2)  __Limitation on convict produced materials__  __.—__ 

        Materials produced after July 1, 1991, by convict labor may only be used in such construction—

            (A) if such materials are produced by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or probation from a prison; or

            (B) if such materials are produced by convicts in a qualified prison facility and the amount of such materials produced in such facility for use in such construction during any 12-month period does not exceed the amount of such materials produced in such facility for use in such construction during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987.

        (3)  __Qualified prison facility defined__  __.—__ 

        As used in this subsection, “qualified prison facility” means any prison facility in which convicts, during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987, produced materials for use in construction of highways or portions of highways located on a Federal-aid system in existence during that period.

    (c) __Construction Work in Alaska.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Secretary shall ensure that a worker who is employed on a remote project for the construction of a highway or portion of a highway located on a Federal-aid system in the State of Alaska and who is not a domiciled resident of the locality shall receive meals and lodging.

        (2)  __Lodging__  __.—__ 

        The lodging under paragraph (1) shall be in accordance with section 1910.142 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (relating to temporary labor camp requirements).

        (3) __Per diem.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            Contractors are encouraged to use commercial facilities and lodges on remote projects, however, when such facilities are not available, per diem in lieu of room and lodging may be paid on remote Federal highway projects at a basic rate of $75.00 per day or part of a day the worker is employed on the project. Where the contractor provides or furnishes room and lodging or pays a per diem, the cost of the amount shall not be considered a part of wages and shall be excluded from the calculation of wages.

            (B)  __Secretary of labor__  __.—__ 

            Such per diem rate shall be adopted by the Secretary of Labor for all applicable remote Federal highway projects in Alaska.

            (C)  __Exception__  __.—__

            (A)  __Remote__  __.—__ 

            The term “remote”, as used with respect to a project, means that the project is 65 road miles or more from the international airport in Fairbanks, Anchorage, or Juneau, Alaska, as the case may be, or is inaccessible by road in a 2-wheel drive vehicle.
