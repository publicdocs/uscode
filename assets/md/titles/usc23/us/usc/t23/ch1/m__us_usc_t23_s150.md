        (2)  __Infrastructure condition__  __.—__ 

        To maintain the highway infrastructure asset system in a state of good repair.

        (3)  __Congestion reduction__  __.—__ 

        To achieve a significant reduction in congestion on the National Highway System.

        To improve the efficiency of the surface transportation system.

        (5)  __Freight movement and economic vitality__  __.—__ 

        To improve the National Highway Freight Network, strengthen the ability of rural communities to access national and international trade markets, and support regional economic development.

        (6)  __Environmental sustainability__  __.—__ 

        To enhance the performance of the transportation system while protecting and enhancing the natural environment.

        (7)  __Reduced project delivery delays__  __.—__

    (c) __Establishment of Performance Measures.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the MAP–21, the Secretary, in consultation with State departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, and other stakeholders, shall promulgate a rulemaking that establishes performance measures and standards.

        (2)  __Administration__  __.—__
