    (a) __In General.—__ 

        (1) __Agreements.—__

            (A) to finance eligible project costs of any project selected under section 602;

            (B) to refinance interim construction financing of eligible project costs of any project selected under section 602;

            (C) to refinance existing Federal credit instruments for rural infrastructure projects; or

            (D)

             to refinance long-term project obligations or Federal credit instruments, if the refinancing provides additional funding capacity for the completion, enhancement, or expansion of any project that—

                (i) is selected under section 602; or

                (ii) otherwise meets the requirements of section 602.

        (2) __Limitation on refinancing of interim construction financing.—__ 

        A loan under paragraph (1) shall not refinance interim construction financing under paragraph (1)(B) later than 1 year after the date of substantial completion of the project.

        (3) __Risk assessment.—__ 

        Before entering into an agreement under this subsection, the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall determine an appropriate capital reserve subsidy amount for each secured loan, taking into account each rating letter provided by an agency under section 602(b)(3)(B).

    (b) __Terms and Limitations.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        A secured loan under this section with respect to a project shall be on such terms and conditions and contain such covenants, representations, warranties, and requirements (including requirements for audits) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

        (2) __Maximum amount.—__ 

        The amount of a secured loan under this section shall not exceed the lesser of 49 percent of the reasonably anticipated eligible project costs or if the secured loan does not receive an investment grade rating, the amount of the senior project obligations.

        (3) __Payment.—__ 

        A secured loan under this section—

            (A)

             shall—

                (i)

                 be payable, in whole or in part, from—

            (C) __Limited buydowns.—__ 

            The interest rate of a secured loan under this section may not be lowered by more than the lower of—

                (ii) the amount of the increase in the interest rate.

        (5) __Maturity date.—__ 

        The final maturity date of the secured loan shall be the lesser of—

            (A) 35 years after the date of substantial completion of the project; and

            (B) __Preexisting indenture.—__ 

                (i) __In general.—__

                (ii) __Limitation.—__ 

                If the Secretary waives the nonsubordination requirement under this subparagraph—

        (3) __Deferred payments.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

            If, at any time after the date of substantial completion of the project, the project is unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay the scheduled loan repayments of principal and interest on the secured loan, the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), allow the obligor to add unpaid principal and interest to the outstanding balance of the secured loan.

            (B) __Interest.—__ 

            Any payment deferred under subparagraph (A) shall—

                (i) continue to accrue interest in accordance with subsection (b)(4) until fully repaid; and
