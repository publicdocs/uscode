### Rule 36. Clerical Error

    After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.

(As amended Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1944__ 

    This rule continues existing law. Rupinski v. United States, 4 F.2d 17 (C.C.A. 6th). The rule is similar to Rule 60(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \[28 U.S.C., Appendix\].

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 36 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.
