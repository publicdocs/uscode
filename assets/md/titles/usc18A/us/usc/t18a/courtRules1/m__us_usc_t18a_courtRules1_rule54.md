### Rule 54. \[Transferred\]  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 All of Rule 54 was moved to Rule 1. </sup></sup> 

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment__ 

    Certain provisions in current Rule 54 have been moved to revised Rule 1 as part of a general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. Other provisions in Rule 54 have been deleted as being unnecessary.
