### Rule 2. Interpretation

    These rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in procedure and fairness in administration, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay.

(As amended Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)

 __Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1944__ 

    Compare Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \[28 U.S.C., Appendix\], Rule 1 (Scope of Rules), last sentence: “They \[the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\] shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.”

 __Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment__ 

    The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic. No substantive change is intended.

    In particular, Rule 2 has been amended to clarify the purpose of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The words “are intended” have been changed to read “are to be interpreted.” The Committee believed that that was the original intent of the drafters and more accurately reflects the purpose of the rules.
