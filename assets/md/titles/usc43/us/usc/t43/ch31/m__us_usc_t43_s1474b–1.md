 __Amendments__ 

    2014—[Pub. L. 113–287][/us/pl/113/287], which directed that this section be “omitted” by substituting “subchapter II of chapter 1007 of title 54” for “the Act of July 27, 1990 ([Public Law 101–337][/us/pl/101/337])”, was executed by amending this section by making the substitution, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1997—[Pub. L. 105–83][/us/pl/105/83] inserted “, including transfers to Federal trustees and payments to non-Federal trustees,” after “account” and “, to remain available until expended,” after “and such sums” and substituted “heretofore and hereafter” for “in fiscal year 1996 and thereafter”.
