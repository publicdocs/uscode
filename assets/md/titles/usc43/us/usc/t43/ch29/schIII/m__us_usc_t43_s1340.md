    (b) __Oil and gas exploration__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, beginning ninety days after September 18, 1978, no exploration pursuant to any oil and gas lease issued or maintained under this subchapter may be undertaken by the holder of such lease, except in accordance with the provisions of this section.

            (C) the general location of each well to be drilled; and

            (D) such other information deemed pertinent by the Secretary.

        (2) The Secretary may require the holder of a lease described in paragraph (1) of this subsection to supply a general statement in accordance with subsection (c)(4) of this section, or to submit other information.

        (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to amend the terms of any permit or plan to which this subsection applies.

        (1) the applicant for such permit is qualified;

        (2) the exploration will not interfere with or endanger operations under any lease issued or maintained pursuant to this subchapter; and
