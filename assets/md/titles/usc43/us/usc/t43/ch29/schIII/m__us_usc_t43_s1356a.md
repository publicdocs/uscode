                    (II) the coastal population of all coastal political subdivisions in the producing State;

                (ii)

                 25 percent shall be allocated to each coastal political subdivision in the proportion that—

                Subject to subparagraph (B) and except as provided in subparagraph (C), in a case in which any amount allocated to a producing State or coastal political subdivision under paragraph (4) or (5) is not disbursed because the producing State does not have in effect a plan that has been approved by the Secretary under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall allocate the undisbursed amount equally among all other producing States.
