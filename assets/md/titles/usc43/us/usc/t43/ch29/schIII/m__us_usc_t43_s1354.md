## § 1354. Limitations on export of oil or gas

    (a) __Application of Export Administration provisions__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any oil or gas produced from the outer Continental Shelf shall be subject to the requirements and provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1969.

    (b) __Condition precedent to exportation; express finding by President of no increase in reliance on imported oil or gas__ 

        Before any oil or gas subject to this section may be exported under the requirements and provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1969, the President shall make and publish an express finding that such exports will not increase reliance on imported oil or gas, are in the national interest, and are in accord with the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1969.

    (c) __Report of findings by President to Congress; joint resolution of disagreement with findings of President__ 

        The President shall submit reports to the Congress containing findings made under this section, and after the date of receipt of such report Congress shall have a period of sixty calendar days, thirty days of which Congress must have been in session, to consider whether exports under the terms of this section are in the national interest. If the Congress within such time period passes a concurrent resolution of disapproval stating disagreement with the President’s finding concerning the national interest, further exports made pursuant to such Presidential findings shall cease.

    (d) __Exchange or temporary exportation of oil and gas for convenience or efficiency of transportation__ 

        The provisions of this section shall not apply to any oil or gas which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the government of a foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, or which is exchanged or exported pursuant to an existing international agreement.
