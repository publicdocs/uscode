            (B) an analysis of the economic impacts such agreement and any amendments necessitated by the agreement will have on domestic exploration, development, and production of hydrocarbon resources on the Outer Continental Shelf; and

            (C) a detailed description of any regulations expected to be issued by the Secretary to implement the agreement.

    (c) __Implementation of specific transboundary agreement with Mexico__

        (3) taking actions consistent with an expert determination under the agreement; and

        (4) ensuring only appropriate inspection staff at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement or other Federal agency personnel designated by the Bureau, the operator, or the lessee have authority to stop work on any installation or other device or vessel permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed of the United States that may be erected thereon for the purpose of resource exploration, development or production activities as approved by the Secretary.

    (d) __Savings provisions__ 

    Nothing in this section shall be construed—

        (1) to authorize the Secretary to participate in any negotiations, conferences, or consultations with Cuba regarding exploration, development, or production of hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Mexico along the United States maritime border with Cuba or the area known by the Department of the Interior as the “Eastern Gap”; or
