    If, by reason of any act of God, or of the public enemy, or any major catastrophe, or any other unforeseen and unavoidable cause, the revenues, for any year of operation, after making provision for costs of operation, maintenance, and the amount to be set aside for said year for replacements, should be insufficient to make the payments to the States of Arizona and Nevada and the transfers to the Colorado River Development Fund in this subchapter provided for, such payments and transfers shall be proportionately reduced, as the Secretary may find to be necessary by reason thereof.
