## § 618m. Effect on existing laws and States’ rights

    Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the States had on July 19, 1940, either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they deem necessary with respect to the appropriation, control, and use of waters within their borders, except as modified by the Colorado River compact or other interstate agreement. Neither the promulgation of charges, or the basis of charges, nor anything contained in this subchapter, or done thereunder, shall in anywise affect, limit, or prejudice any right of any State in or to the waters of the Colorado River system under the Colorado River compact. Sections 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d) of the Project Act \[[43 U.S.C. 617][/us/usc/t43/s617]l(b), (c), and (d)\] and all other provisions of said Project Act \[[43 U.S.C. 617][/us/usc/t43/s617] et seq.\] not inconsistent with the terms of this subchapter shall remain in full force and effect.
