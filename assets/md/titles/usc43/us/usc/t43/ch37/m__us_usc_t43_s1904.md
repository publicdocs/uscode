## § 1904. Range improvement funding

    (a) __Authorization of additional appropriations__ 

        In order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated the sum of an additional $15,000,000 annually in fiscal years 1980 through 1982; for fiscal years 1983 through 1986 an amount no less than the amount authorized for 1982; and for fiscal years 1987 through 1999 an amount not less than $5,000,000 annually more than the amount authorized for fiscal year 1986. Such funds shall be in addition to any range, wildlife, and soil and water management moneys which have been requested by the Secretary under the provisions of [section 1748 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1748], and in addition to the moneys which are available for range improvements under [section 1751 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1751].

    (b) __Availability of unappropriated funds for subsequent fiscal years__ 

        Any amounts authorized by this section not appropriated in one or more fiscal years shall be available for appropriation in any subsequent years.

    (c) __Fund limitations for prescribed uses; distribution, consultation and coordination; public hearings and meetings; interested parties; priority of cooperative agreements with range users__ 

        No less than 80 per centum of such funds provided herein shall be used for on-the-ground range rehabilitation, maintenance and the construction of range improvements (including project layout, project design, and project supervision). No more than 15 per centum of such funds provided herein shall be used to hire and train such experienced and qualified personnel as are necessary to implement on-the-ground supervision and enforcement of the land use plans required pursuant to [section 1712 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1712] and such allotment management plans as may be developed. Such funds shall be distributed as the Secretary deems advisable after careful and considered consultation and coordination, including public hearings and meetings where appropriate, with the district grazing advisory boards established pursuant to [section 1753 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1753], and the advisory councils established pursuant to [section 1739 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1739], range user representatives, and other interested parties. To the maximum extent practicable, and where economically sound, the Secretary shall give priority to entering into cooperative agreements with range users (or user groups) for the installation and maintenance of on-the-ground range improvements.

    (d) __Environmental assessment record and environmental impact statement requirements__ 

        Prior to the use of any funds authorized by this section the Secretary shall cause to have prepared an environmental assessment record on each range improvement project. Thereafter, improvement projects may be constructed unless the Secretary determines that the proj­ect will have a significant impact on the quality of human environment, necessitating an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act \[[42 U.S.C. 4321][/us/usc/t42/s4321] et seq.\] prior to the expenditure of funds.
