## § 1903. Rangelands inventory and management; public availability

    (a) Following enactment of this chapter, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall update, develop (where necessary) and maintain on a continuing basis thereafter, an inventory of range conditions and record of trends of range conditions on the public rangelands, and shall categorize or identify such lands on the basis of the range conditions and trends thereof as they deem appropriate. Such inventories shall be conducted and maintained by the Secretary as a part of the inventory process required by section 201(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act ([43 U.S.C. 1711][/us/usc/t43/s1711]), and by the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with [section 1603 of title 16][/us/usc/t16/s1603]; shall be kept current on a regular basis so as to reflect changes in range conditions; and shall be available to the public.

    (b) The Secretary shall manage the public rangelands in accordance with the Taylor Grazing Act ([43 U.S.C. 315–315(o)][/us/usc/t43/s315–315/o]), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ([43 U.S.C. 1701–178][/us/usc/t43/s1701–178]2), and other applicable law consistent with the public rangelands improvement program pursuant to this chapter. Except where the land use planning process required pursuant to section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act ([43 U.S.C. 1712][/us/usc/t43/s1712]) determines otherwise or the Secretary determines, and sets forth his reasons for this determination, that grazing uses should be discontinued (either temporarily or permanently) on certain lands, the goal of such management shall be to improve the range conditions of the public rangelands so that they become as productive as feasible in accordance with the rangeland management objectives established through the land use planning process, and consistent with the values and objectives listed in sections 1901(a) and (b)(2) of this title.
