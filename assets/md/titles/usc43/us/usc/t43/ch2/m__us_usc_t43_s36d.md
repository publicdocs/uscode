    Notwithstanding the provisions of the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 ([31 U.S.C. 6301–630][/us/usc/t31/s6301–630]8), the United States Geological Survey is authorized to continue existing, and on and after November 10, 2003, to enter into new cooperative agreements directed towards a particular cooperator, in support of joint research and data collection activities with Federal, State, and academic partners funded by appropriations herein, including those that provide for space in cooperator facilities.
