> “It is the sense of the Congress that the Continental Scientific Drilling Program is an important national scientific endeavor, benefiting the commerce of the Nation, which should be vigorously pursued by Government and the private sector. The Continental Scientific Drilling Program is an important national scientific endeavor that is vital to the understanding of the geologic evolution of the Earth and the economic value of its resources; the most effective and efficient means of realizing the fullest potential in the Continental Scientific Drilling Program is through a cooperative effort by the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the United States Geological Survey; many important commercial and scientific advances may result from the Continental Scientific Drilling Program; and many foreign nations are engaged in a comparable deep drilling program, and cooperation and coordination would be beneficial to United States efforts. It is the sense of the Congress that—

>     “(1) the Continental Scientific Drilling Program is an important national scientific endeavor by the United States which should be enthusiastically implemented through a joint cooperative effort among the United States Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the United States Geological Survey;

>     “(2) the private sector should be encouraged to support the Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the participating agencies should solicit appropriate private sector participation in such program; and

>     “(3) the United States Government should cooperate to the extent practicable with the international community in developing this important scientific and technical activity.”
