    (a) __Establishment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Survey shall establish a national geologic-map database.

        (2) __Function__ 

        The database shall serve as a national catalog and archive, distributed through links to Federal and State geologic map holdings, that includes—

            (A) all maps developed with funding provided by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, including under the Federal, State, and education components;

            (B) the databases developed in connection with investigations under subclauses (III), (IV), and (V) of [section 31c(d)(1)(C)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s31c/d/1/C/ii]; and

    (b) __Standardization__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Geologic maps contributed to the national archives shall have format, symbols, and technical attributes that adhere to standards so that archival information can be accessed, exchanged, and compared efficiently and accurately, as required by Executive Order 12906 (59 Fed. Reg. 17,671 (1994)), which established the National Spatial Data Infrastructure.

        (2) __Development of standards__
