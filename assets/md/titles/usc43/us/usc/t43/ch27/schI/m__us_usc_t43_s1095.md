## § 1095. Reservations between sections for highway purposes

    There shall be reserved public highways four rods wide between each section of land in said former Territory of Oklahoma, the section lines being the center of said highways; but no deduction shall be made, where cash payments are provided for, in the amount to be paid for each quarter section of land by reason of such reservation. But if the said highway shall be vacated by any competent authority, the title to the respective strips shall inure to the then owner of the tract of which it formed a part by the original survey.
