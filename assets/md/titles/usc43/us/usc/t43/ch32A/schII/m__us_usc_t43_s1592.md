## § 1592. Authorization to construct, operate, and maintain salinity control units and salinity control programs

    (a) __Authority of Secretary__ 

    The Secretary is authorized to construct, operate, and maintain the following salinity control units and salinity control programs as the initial stage of the Colorado River Basin salinity control program:

        (1) The Paradox Valley unit, Montrose County, Colorado, consisting of facilities for collection and disposition of saline ground water of Paradox Valley, including wells, pumps, pipelines, solar evaporation ponds, and all necessary appurtenant and associated works such as roads, fences, dikes, power transmission facilities, and permanent operating facilities, and consisting of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone.

        (2) The Grand Valley unit, Colorado, consisting of measures and all necessary appurtenant and associated works to reduce the seepage of irrigation water from the irrigated lands of Grand Valley into the ground water and thence into the Colorado River. Measures shall include lining of canals and laterals, replacing canals and laterals with pipe, and the combining of existing canals and laterals into fewer and more efficient facilities implementing other measures to reduce salt contributions from the Grand Valley to the Colorado River, and implementing measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone.. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  Prior to initiation of construction of the Grand Valley unit, or portion thereof, the Secretary shall enter into contracts through which the non-Federal entities owning, operating, and maintaining the water distribution systems, or portions thereof, in Grand Valley, singly or in concert, will assume the obligations specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section relating to the continued operation and maintenance of the unit’s facilities to the end that the maximum reduction of salinity inflow to the Colorado River will be achieved.

        (3) The Las Vegas Wash unit, Nevada, consisting of facilities for collection and disposition of saline ground water of Las Vegas Wash, including infiltration galleries, pumps, desalter, pipelines, solar evaporation facilities, and all appurtenant works including but not limited to roads, fences, power transmission facilities, and operating facilities, and consisting of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone.

        (4) Stage I of the Lower Gunnison Basin unit, Colorado, consisting of measures and all necessary appurtenant and associated works to reduce seepage from canals and laterals in the Uncompahgre Valley, and consisting of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone, essentially as described in the feasibility report and final environmental statement dated February 10, 1984. Prior to initiation of construction of stage I of the Lower Gunnison Basin unit, or of a portion of stage I, the Secretary shall enter into contracts through which the non-Federal entities owning, operating, and maintaining the water distribution systems, or portions thereof, in the Uncompahgre Valley, singly or in concert, will assume the obligations specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section relating to the continued operation and maintenance of the unit’s facilities.

        (5) Portions of the McElmo Creek unit, Colorado, as components of the Dolores participating project, Colorado River Storage project, authorized by [Public Law 90–537][/us/pl/90/537] \[[43 U.S.C. 1501][/us/usc/t43/s1501] et seq.\] and [Public Law 84–485][/us/pl/84/485] \[[43 U.S.C. 620][/us/usc/t43/s620] et seq.\], consisting of all measures and all necessary appurtenant and associated works to reduce seepage only from the Towaoc-Highline combined canal, Rocky Ford laterals, Lone Pine lateral, and Upper Hermana lateral, and consisting of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone. The Dolores participating project shall have salinity control as a project purpose insofar as these specific facilities are concerned: Provided, That the costs of construction and replacement of these specific facilities shall be allocated by the Secretary to salinity control and irrigation only after consultation with the State of Colorado, the Montezuma Valley Irrigation District, Colorado, and the Dolores Water Conservancy District, Colorado: And provided further, That such allocation of costs to salinity control will include only the separable and specific costs of these specific facilities and will not include any joint costs of any other facilities of the Dolores participating project. Repayment of costs allocated to salinity control shall be subject to this chapter. Repayment of costs allocated to irrigation shall be subject to the Acts which authorized the Dolores participating project, the Reclamation Act of 1902, and Acts amendatory and supplementary thereto. Prior to initiation of construction of these specific facilities, or a portion thereof, the Secretary shall enter into contracts through which the non-Federal entities owning, operating, and maintaining the water distribution systems, or portions thereof, in the Montezuma Valley, singly or in concert, will assume the obligations specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section relating to the continued operation and maintenance of the unit’s facilities.

        (6) A basinwide salinity control program that the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, shall implement. The Secretary may carry out the purposes of this paragraph directly, or may make grants, commitments for grants, or advances of funds to non-Federal entities under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require. Such program shall consist of cost-effective measures and associated works to reduce salinity from saline springs, leaking wells, irrigation sources, industrial sources, erosion of public and private land, or other sources that the Secretary considers appropriate. Such program shall provide for the mitigation of incidental fish and wildlife values that are lost as a result of the measures and associated works. The Secretary shall submit a planning report concerning the program established under this paragraph to the appropriate committees of Congress. The Secretary may not expend funds for any implementation measure under the program established under this paragraph before the expiration of a 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary submits such report.

        (7) __Basin states program.—__ 

            (A)  __In general__  __.—__ 

            A Basin States Program that the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, shall implement to carry out salinity control activities in the Colorado River Basin using funds made available under [section 1595(f) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1595/f].

            (B)  __Assistance__  __.—__ 

            The Secretary, in consultation with the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Advisory Council, shall carry out this paragraph using funds described in subparagraph (A) directly or by providing grants, grant commitments, or advance funds to Federal or non-Federal entities under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require.

            (C)  __Activities__  __.—__ 

            Funds described in subparagraph (A) shall be used to carry out, as determined by the Secretary—

                (i) cost-effective measures and associated works to reduce salinity from saline springs, leaking wells, irrigation sources, industrial sources, erosion of public and private land, or other sources;

                (ii) operation and maintenance of salinity control features constructed under the Colorado River Basin salinity control program; and

                (iii) studies, planning, and administration of salinity control activities.

            (D) __Report.—__
