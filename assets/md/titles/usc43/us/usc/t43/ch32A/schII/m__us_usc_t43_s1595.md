If in any fiscal year the money available from the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund for such repayment is insufficient to repay the costs allocated to the lower basin, as provided in the preceding sentence, the deficiency shall be repaid with interest as soon as money becomes available in the fund for repayment of those costs.

            (iv) The interest rates used pursuant to this chapter shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period during the month preceding October 30, 1984, for costs outstanding at that date, or, in the case of costs incurred subsequent to October 30, 1984, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred.
