## § 1641. Conveyances to Village Corporations

    (a) __Optional procedure__ 

        The provisions of this section shall be applicable only to the conveyance of Federal lands described herein to a Native Corporation which within one hundred and eighty days after December 2, 1980, or the date of eligibility determination, whichever is later, files a document with the Secretary setting forth its election to receive conveyance pursuant to this section.

    (b) __“Core” townships, etc.__ 

        (1)

            (A) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), 14(b), or 22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1611(a)][/us/usc/t43/s1611/a], 1613(a), 1613(b), or 1621(l)\], subject to valid existing rights and [section 1633(a) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1633/a], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 or 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1610][/us/usc/t43/s1610] or 1615\] and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1618(b)][/us/usc/t43/s1618/b]\], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the public lands, as defined in such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\], in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(1) or 16(a) of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1)][/us/usc/t43/s1610/a/1] or 1615(a)\] in which all or any part of such Village is located. As used in this paragraph the term “Native Village” has the same meaning such term has in section 3(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1602(c)][/us/usc/t43/s1602/c]\].

            (B) Where two or more Village Corporations are entitled to the same land by virtue of the same township or townships embracing all or part of the Native Villages, the conveyance made by paragraph (A) shall not be effective as to such lands until an arbitration decision or other binding agreement between or among the Corporations is filed with and published by the Secretary. Within thirty days of receipt of such decision or agreement, the Secretary shall publish notice of the decision or agreement in the Federal Register. Effective with such publication, title to the lands conveyed by subparagraph (A) shall vest in the Village Corporation as specified in the decision or agreement. For purposes of [section 1632 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1632], until title vests in the Village Corporation pursuant to this subparagraph, the Secretary shall consider the entire acreage involved chargeable to each Corporation’s entitlement.

        (2) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), or 22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1611(a)][/us/usc/t43/s1611/a], 1613(a), or 1621(l)\], subject to valid existing rights and [section 1633(a) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1633/a], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1610][/us/usc/t43/s1610]\], and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1618(b)][/us/usc/t43/s1618/b]\], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(2) of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(2)][/us/usc/t43/s1610/a/2]\] in which all or any part of such village is located: Provided, That any such land reserved to or selected by the State of Alaska under the Acts of March 4, 1915 ([38 Stat. 1214][/us/stat/38/1214]), as amended, January 21, 1929 ([45 Stat. 1091][/us/stat/45/1091]), as amended, or July 28, 1956 ([70 Stat. 709][/us/stat/70/709]), and lands selected by the State which have been tentatively approved to the State under section 6(g) of the Alaska Statehood Act and as to which the State, prior to December 18, 1971, had conditionally granted title to, or contracts to purchase, the surface estate to third parties, including cities and boroughs within the State, and such reservations, selections, grants, and contracts had not expired or been relinquished or revoked by December 2, 1980, shall not be conveyed by operation of this paragraph: And provided further, That the provisions of subparagraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to the conveyances under this paragraph.

        (3) Subject to valid existing rights and [section 1633(a) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1633/a], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation which, by December 2, 1980, is determined by the Secretary to be eligible under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\] to, and has elected to, acquire title to any estate pursuant to section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1618(b)][/us/usc/t43/s1618/b]\], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the estates in a reserve, as such reserve existed on December 18, 1971, which was set aside for the use or benefit of the stockholders or members of such Corporation before December 18, 1971. Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to the Village Corporation for the Native village of Klukwan, which Corporation shall receive those rights granted to it by the Act of January 2, 1976 ([Public Law 94–204][/us/pl/94/204]) as amended by the Act of October 4, 1976 ([Public Law 94–456][/us/pl/94/456]).

        (4) Subject to valid existing rights and [section 1633(a) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1633/a], and except where such lands are within a National Wildlife Refuge or the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska, for which the Regional Corporation obtains in-lieu rights pursuant to section 12(a)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1611(a)(1)][/us/usc/t43/s1611/a/1]\], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Regional Corporation which, as a result of a conveyance of a surface estate by operation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, is entitled under section 14(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1613(f)][/us/usc/t43/s1613/f]\] to receive the subsurface estate corresponding to such surface estate, all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to such subsurface estate.

    (c) __Documents__ 

        As soon as possible after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall issue to each Native Corporation referred to in subsection (b) of this section interim conveyances or patents to the estate or estates conveyed to such Corporation by such subsection, but title shall be deemed to have passed on the date of the filing of a document of election described in subsection (a) of this section, notwithstanding any delay in the issuance of the interim conveyances or patents.

    (d) __Reconveyances; disputes__ 

        A Village Corporation’s obligation to reconvey lands under section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1613(c)][/us/usc/t43/s1613/c]\] shall arise only upon receipt of an interim conveyance or patent, whichever is earlier, under subsection (c) of this section or under such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\]. For purposes of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\], legislative conveyances made by, or interim conveyances and patents issued pursuant to, this title shall have the same effect as if issued pursuant to sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(f), and 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1613(a)][/us/usc/t43/s1613/a], 1613(b), 1613(f), and 1618(b)\] and shall be deemed to have been so issued. Disputes between or among Native Corporations arising from conveyances under this Act shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators of a type described in section 12(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1611(e)][/us/usc/t43/s1611/e]\] pertaining to disputes over land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations.

    (e) __Existing rights__ 

        All conveyances made by operation of this section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t43/s1601] et seq.\] as if such conveyances or patents had been made or issued pursuant to that Act.

    (f) __Easements__ 

        For a period of one year from December 2, 1980, the Secretary may identify and issue a decision to reserve in the patent those easements, pursuant to section 17(b)(3) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1616(b)(3)][/us/usc/t43/s1616/b/3]\], which are described in section 17(b)(1) of such Act \[[43 U.S.C. 1616(b)(1)][/us/usc/t43/s1616/b/1]\] on lands conveyed by this section, but the Secretary shall not reserve a greater number of easements or more land for a particular easement or easements than is reasonably necessary and he shall be guided by the principles of [section 1633 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1633]. Upon the finality of the decision so issued, such easements shall be reserved in the conveyance document or documents issued by the Secretary as required by this section.

    (g) __“Native Corporation” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “Native Corporation” means Village Corporations and Regional Corporations.
