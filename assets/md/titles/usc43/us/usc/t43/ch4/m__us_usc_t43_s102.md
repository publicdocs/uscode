([Jan. 31, 1903, ch. 344, § 1][/us/act/1903-01-31/ch344/s1], [32 Stat. 790][/us/stat/32/790]; [Oct. 28, 1921, ch. 114, § 1][/us/act/1921-10-28/ch114/s1], [42 Stat. 208][/us/stat/42/208]; [Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 462][/us/act/1925-03-03/ch462], [43 Stat. 1145][/us/stat/43/1145]; 1946 Reorg. Plan No. 3, § 403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, [60 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/60/1100].)

 __Codification__ 

    The original text of this section referred to both registers and receivers, but reference to the latter was omitted in view of the abolition of such office under acts Oct. 28, 1921, and Mar. 3, 1925, which provided for the consolidation of the two offices under a register only. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of Department of the Interior, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of the Interior, with power to delegate, see Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1262][/us/stat/64/1262], set out under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1451].

    “Officers of district land offices designated by the Secretary of the Interior” substituted for “Registers of the land office, or either of them,” on authority of section 403 of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946. See note set out under [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1].
