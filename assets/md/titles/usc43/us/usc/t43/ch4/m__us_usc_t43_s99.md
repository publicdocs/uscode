 __Codification__ 

    This section, as originally enacted, related to receivers of public moneys for land districts. The office of receiver was consolidated with that of register by acts Mar. 3, 1925, and Oct. 28, 1921, under which the office of receiver was abolished. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of Department of the Interior, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of the Interior, with power to delegate, see Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1262][/us/stat/64/1262], set out under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1451].

    Words “officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior” substituted for “register” on authority of section 403 of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946. See note set out under [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1].

    “Government Accountability Office” substituted in text for “General Accounting Office” pursuant to [section 8(b) of Pub. L. 108–271][/us/pl/108/271/s8/b], set out as a note under [section 702 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s702], Money and Finance, which redesignated the General Accounting Office and any references thereto as the Government Accountability Office. Previously, “General Accounting Office” substituted in text for “proper officer of the Treasury Department” pursuant to act June 10, 1921, which transferred all powers and duties of the Comptroller, six auditors, and certain other employees of the Treasury to the General Accounting Office. See section 701 et seq. of Title 31.
