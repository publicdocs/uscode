## § 105. Depositions of witnesses residing outside county

    Whenever the witness resides outside the county in which the hearing occurs any party to the proceeding may take the testimony of such witness in the county of such witness’s residence in the form of depositions by giving ten days’ written notice of the time and place of taking such depositions to the opposite party or parties. The depositions may be taken before any United States magistrate judge, notary public, judge, or clerk of a court of record. Subpoenas for witnesses before the officer taking depositions may issue from the office of the officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior or may be issued by the officer taking the depositions, and disobedience thereof, as defined in [section 104 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s104], shall also be punished; and the witness shall receive the same fees and mileage and be subject to the same penalties in all respects as in case of violation of a subpoena to appear before the officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior and subject to the same limitations. The fees of the officer taking the depositions shall be the same as those allowed in the State or Territorial courts, and shall be paid by the party taking the deposition, and an itemized account of the fees shall be made by the officer taking the depositions and attached to the depositions.

 __Codification__ 

    The original text of this section referred to both registers and receivers, but reference to the latter was omitted in view of the abolition of such office under acts Mar. 3, 1925, and Oct. 28, 1921, which provided for the consolidation of the two offices under a register only. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.

Previously, “United States magistrate” substituted for “United States commissioner” pursuant to [Pub. L. 90–578][/us/pl/90/578]. See chapter 43 (§ 631 et seq.) of Title 28.

    For transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of Department of the Interior, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of the Interior, with power to delegate, see Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1262][/us/stat/64/1262], set out under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1451].
