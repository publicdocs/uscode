## § 75. Administration of oaths

    The officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, and it shall be his duty, to administer any oath required by law or the instructions of the Bureau of Land Management, in connection with the entry or purchase of any tract of the public lands; but he shall not charge or receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation for administering such oath.

(R.S. § 2246; [Oct. 28, 1921, ch. 114, § 1][/us/act/1921-10-28/ch114/s1], [42 Stat. 208][/us/stat/42/208]; [Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 462][/us/act/1925-03-03/ch462], [43 Stat. 1145][/us/stat/43/1145]; 1946 Reorg. Plan No. 3, § 403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, [60 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/60/1100].)

 __Codification__ 

    The words “or receiver” which followed “register” in the original text were omitted, in view of act Mar. 3, 1925 (classified to [section 71 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s71]), providing for the consolidation of the offices of register and receiver. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.

    R.S. § 2246 derived from [act June 12, 1840, ch. 35][/us/act/1840-06-12/ch35], [5 Stat. 384][/us/stat/5/384].

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of Department of the Interior, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of the Interior, with power to delegate, see Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1262][/us/stat/64/1262], set out under [section 1451 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1451].

    Reference to “register” changed to “officer designated by the Secretary of the Interior” and “Bureau of Land Management” substituted for “General Land Office” on authority of section 403 of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946. See note set out under [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1].
