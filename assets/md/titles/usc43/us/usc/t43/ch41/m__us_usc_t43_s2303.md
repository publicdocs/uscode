## § 2303. Identification of inholdings

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a procedure to—

        (1) identify, by State, inholdings for which the landowner has indicated a desire to sell the land or interest therein to the United States; and

    (b) __Public notice__ 

        As soon as practicable after July 25, 2000, and periodically thereafter, the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide public notice of the procedures referred to in subsection (a), including any information necessary for the consideration of an inholding under [section 2305 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s2305]. Such notice shall include publication in the Federal Register and by such other means as the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture determine to be appropriate.

    (c) __Identification__ 

    An inholding—

        (1) shall be considered for identification under this section only if the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture receive notification of a desire to sell from the landowner in response to public notice given under subsection (b); and

        (2)

         shall be deemed to have been established as of the later of—

            (A)

             the earlier of—

                (i) the date on which the land was withdrawn from the public domain; or

                (ii) the date on which the land was established or designated for special management; or

            (B) the date on which the inholding was acquired by the current owner.

    (d) __No obligation to convey or acquire__ 

        The identification of an inholding under this section creates no obligation on the part of a landowner to convey the inholding or any obligation on the part of the United States to acquire the inholding.
