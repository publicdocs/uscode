## § 2305. Federal Land Disposal Account

    (a) __Deposit of proceeds__ 

        Notwithstanding any other law (except a law that specifically provides for a proportion of the proceeds to be distributed to any trust funds of any States), the gross proceeds of the sale or exchange of public land under this chapter  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  shall be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury of the United States to be known as the “Federal Land Disposal Account”.

    (b) __Availability__ 

        Amounts in the Federal Land Disposal Account shall be available to the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture, without further Act of appropriation, to carry out this chapter.

    (c) __Use of the Federal Land Disposal Account__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Funds in the Federal Land Disposal Account shall be expended in accordance with this subsection.

        (2) __Fund allocation__ 

            (A) __Purchase of land__ 

            Except as authorized under subparagraph (C), funds shall be used to purchase lands or interests therein that are otherwise authorized by law to be acquired, and that are—

                (i) inholdings; and

                (ii) adjacent to federally designated areas and contain exceptional resources.

            (B) __Inholdings__ 

                Not less than 80 percent of the funds allocated for the purchase of land within each State shall be used to acquire inholdings identified under [section 2303 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s2303].

            (C) __Administrative and other expenses__ 

                An amount not to exceed 20 percent of the funds deposited in the Federal Land Disposal Account may be used by the Secretary for administrative and other expenses necessary to carry out the land disposal program under [section 2304 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s2304].

            (D) __Same State purchases__ 

                Of the amounts not used under subparagraph (C), not less than 80 percent shall be expended within the State in which the funds were generated. Any remaining funds may be expended in any other State.

        (3) __Priority__ 

        The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall develop a procedure for prioritizing the acquisition of inholdings and non-Federal lands with exceptional resources as provided in paragraph (2). Such procedure shall consider—

            (A) the date the inholding was established (as provided in [section 2303(c) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s2303/c]);

            (B) the extent to which acquisition of the land or interest therein will facilitate management efficiency; and

            (C) such other criteria as the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture deem appropriate.

        (4) __Basis of sale__ 

        Any land acquired under this section shall be—

            (A) from a willing seller;

            (B) contingent on the conveyance of title acceptable to the Secretary, or the Secretary of Agriculture in the case of an acquisition of National Forest System land, using title standards of the Attorney General;

            (C) at a price not to exceed fair market value consistent with applicable provisions of the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions; and

            (D) managed as part of the unit within which it is contained.

    (d) __Contaminated sites and sites difficult and uneconomic to manage__ 

    Funds in the Federal Land Disposal Account shall not be used to purchase land or an interest in land that, as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture—

        (1) contains a hazardous substance or is otherwise contaminated; or

        (2) because of the location or other characteristics of the land, would be difficult or uneconomic to manage as Federal land.

    (e) __Chapter 2003 of title 54__ 

        Funds made available under this section shall be supplemental to any funds appropriated under chapter 2003 of title 54.

    (f) __Termination__ 

    On termination of activities under [section 2304 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s2304]—

        (1) the Federal Land Disposal Account shall be terminated; and

        (2) any remaining balance in the account shall become available for appropriation under [section 200303 of title 54][/us/usc/t54/s200303].

 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this Act” and was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title II of [Pub. L. 106–248][/us/pl/106/248], which enacted this chapter, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    2014—Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 113–287, § 5][/us/pl/113/287/s5]l)(9)(A), substituted “chapter 2003 of title 54” for “the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act ([16 U.S.C. 460l–4][/us/usc/t16/s460l–4] et seq.)”.

    Subsec. (f)(2). [Pub. L. 113–287, § 5][/us/pl/113/287/s5]l(9)(B), which directed substitution of “[section 200303 of title 54][/us/usc/t54/s200303]” for “section 3 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 ([16 U.S.C. 460][/us/usc/t16/s460]l–6)”, was executed by making the substitution for “section 3 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act ([16 U.S.C. 460][/us/usc/t16/s460]l–6)” to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
