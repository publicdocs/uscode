        (2) The land conveyed to Kake Tribal Corporation and to Sealaska Corporation under this section is, for all purposes, considered to be land conveyed under this chapter. However, the conveyance of such land to Kake Tribal Corporation shall not count against or otherwise affect the Corporation’s remaining entitlement under [section 1615(b) of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1615/b].

    (h) __Timber manufacturing; export restriction__
