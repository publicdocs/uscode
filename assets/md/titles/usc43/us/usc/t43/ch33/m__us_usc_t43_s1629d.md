        (2)

            (B) A demand for payment made pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be honored.

    (b) __Relationship to State procedure__ 

        (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the laws of the State governing the right of a dissenting shareholder to demand and receive payment for his or her shares shall apply to demands for payment honored pursuant to subsection (a)(2).
