## § 316b. Grazing districts

    (a) The Secretary may establish grazing districts upon any public lands outside of the Aleutian Islands Reservation, national forests, and other reservations administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and outside of national parks and monuments which, in his opinion, are valuable for the grazing of livestock. Such districts may include such areas of surveyed and unsurveyed lands as he determines may be conveniently administered as a unit, even if such areas are neither contiguous nor adjacent.

    (b) The Secretary, after the establishment of a district, is authorized to lease the grazing privileges therein in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> 

([Mar. 4, 1927, ch. 513, § 3][/us/act/1927-03-04/ch513/s3], [44 Stat. 1452][/us/stat/44/1452].)

 __References in Text__ 

    This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original “this title” and has been translated as if the reference was to “this Act” to reflect the probable intent of Congress inasmuch as the act of Mar. 4, 1927, was not divided into titles.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 471b of Title 48][/us/usc/t48/s471b], Territories and Insular Possessions.
