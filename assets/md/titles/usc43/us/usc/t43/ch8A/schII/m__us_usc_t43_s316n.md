 __References in Text__ 

    This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this title” and has been translated as if the reference was to “this Act” to reflect the probable intent of Congress inasmuch as the act of Mar. 4, 1927, was not divided into titles.

 __Codification__ 

    In subsec. (a), “chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” substituted for “the Classification act of 1949, as amended” on authority of [Pub.

    Section was formerly classified to [section 471n of Title 48][/us/usc/t48/s471n], Territories and Insular Possessions.

 __Amendments__ 

    1949—Subsec. (a). Act Oct. 28, 1949, substituted “Classification Act of 1949” for “Classification Act of 1923”.

 __Repeals__ 

    [Act Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782][/us/act/1949-10-28/ch782], cited as a credit to this section, was repealed (subject to a savings clause) by [Pub. L. 89–554, § 8][/us/pl/89/554/s8], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632], 655.
