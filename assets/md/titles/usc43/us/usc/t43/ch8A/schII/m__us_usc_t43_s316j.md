    (a) __Authorization__ 

        The Secretary may authorize a lessee to construct and/or maintain and utilize upon any area included within the provisions of his lease any fence, building, corral, reservoir, well or other improvements needed for the exercise of the grazing privileges of the lessee within such area; but any such fence shall be constructed as to permit the ingress and egress of miners, prospectors for minerals, and other persons entitled to enter such area for lawful purposes.

    (b) __Removal of improvement upon termination of lease__ 

        The lessee shall be given ninety days from the date of termination of his lease for any cause to remove from the area included within the provisions of his lease any fence, building, corral, or other removable range improvement owned or controlled by him.

    (c) __Payment for improvement upon termination of lease__ 

        If such lessee notifies the Secretary on or before the termination of his lease of his determination to leave on the land any improvements the construction or maintenance of which has been authorized by the Secretary, no other person shall use or occupy under any grazing lease, or entry under any public land law, the land on which any such improvements are located until there has been paid to the person entitled thereto the value of such improvements as determined by the Secretary.
