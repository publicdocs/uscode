Such lands shall not be subject to disposition, settlement, or occupation until after the same have been classified and opened to entry: Provided, That locations and entries under the mining laws including the Act of February 25, 1920, as amended \[[30 U.S.C. 181][/us/usc/t30/s181] et seq.\], may be made upon such withdrawn and reserved areas without regard to classification and without restrictions or limitation by any provision of this subchapter.
