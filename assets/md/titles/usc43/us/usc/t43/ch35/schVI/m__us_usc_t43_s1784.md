## § 1784. Lands in Alaska; designation as wilderness; management by Bureau of Land Management pending Congressional action

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, [section 1782 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1782] shall not apply to any lands in Alaska. However, in carrying out his duties under sections 1711 and 1712 of this title and other applicable laws, the Secretary may identify areas in Alaska which he determines are suitable as wilderness and may, from time to time, make recommendations to the Congress for inclusion of any such areas in the National Wilderness Preservation System, pursuant to the provisions of the Wilderness Act \[[16 U.S.C. 1131][/us/usc/t16/s1131] et seq.\]. In the absence of congressional action relating to any such recommendation of the Secretary, the Bureau of Land Management shall manage all such areas which are within its jurisdiction in accordance with the applicable land use plans and applicable provisions of law.

The conveyance restrictions imposed by section 22(g) of ANCSA \[[43 U.S.C. 1621(g)][/us/usc/t43/s1621/g]\] (i) shall then be ineffective and cease to apply to such interests of KNA and CIRI, and (ii) shall not be applicable to the interests received by KNA in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) or to the CIRI interests underlying them. The Secretary shall adjust the boundaries of the Refuge so as to exclude all interests in lands retained or received in exchange by KNA in accordance with this section, including both surface and subsurface, and shall also exclude all interests currently held by CIRI.

>                     “(II) In the event that no agreement is executed as provided for in subclause (I), solely for the purposes of administering CIRI’s rights under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the Terms and Conditions, the Secretary and CIRI shall be deemed to have retained their respective rights and obligations with respect to CIRI’s subsurface interests under the requirements of the Terms and Conditions in effect on June 18, 1996. Notwithstanding the boundary adjustments made pursuant to this section, conveyances to KNA shall be deemed to remain subject to the Secretary’s and CIRI’s rights and obligations under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the Terms and Conditions.

>                 “(iii) The Secretary is authorized to acquire by purchase or exchange, on a willing seller basis only, any lands retained by or conveyed to KNA. In the event that any lands owned by KNA are subsequently acquired by the United States, they shall be automatically included in the Refuge System. The laws and regulations applicable to Refuge lands shall then apply to these lands and the Secretary shall then adjust the boundaries accordingly.

>                 “(iv) Nothing in this section is intended to enlarge or diminish the authorities, rights, duties, obligations, or the property rights held by CIRI under the Terms and Conditions, or otherwise except as set forth in this section. In the event of the purchase by the United States of any lands from KNA in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the United States shall reassume from KNA the rights it previously held under the Terms and Conditions and the provisions in any patent implementing section 22(g) of ANCSA \[[43 U.S.C. 1621(g)][/us/usc/t43/s1621/g]\] will again apply.

Such maps and legal description shall have the same force and effect as if included in the section, except that the Secretary may correct clerical and typographical errors.

>             KNA may accept the offer made in this section by notifying the Secretary in writing of its decision within 180 days of receipt of the offer. In the event the offer is rejected, the Secretary shall notify the Committee on Resources \[now Committee on Natural Resources\] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

>             “(D) __Final maps.—__ 

>             Not later than 120 days after the conclusion of the acquisition authorized by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall transmit a final report and maps accurately depicting the lands transferred and conveyed pursuant to this section and the acreage and legal descriptions of such lands to the Committee on Resources \[now Committee on Natural Resources\] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

>     “(e) __Adjustments to National Wilderness System.—__ 

>     Upon acquisition of lands by the United States pursuant to subsection (d)(2)(A), that portion of the Stephanka Tract lying south and west of the Kenai River, consisting of approximately 592 acres, shall be included in and managed as part of the Kenai Wilderness and such lands shall be managed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Wilderness Act and ANILCA.

>     “(f) __Designation of Lake Todatonten Special Management Area.—__

Any lands conveyed to the State of Alaska shall be removed from the Lake Todatonten Special Management Area.

>             “(B) The Secretary may permit any additional uses of the area, or grant easements, only to the extent that such use, including leasing under the mineral leasing laws, is determined to not detract from nor materially interfere with the purposes for which the Special Management Area is established.

Such rights may be subject to restrictions issued by the BLM to protect subsistence uses of the Special Management Area.
