## § 1721. Conveyances of public lands to States, local governments, etc.

    (a) __Unsurveyed islands; authorization and limitations on authority__ 

        The Secretary is authorized to convey to States or their political subdivisions under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act ([44 Stat. 741][/us/stat/44/741] as amended; [43 U.S.C. 869][/us/usc/t43/s869] et seq.), as amended, but without regard to the acreage limitations contained therein, unsurveyed islands determined by the Secretary to be public lands of the United States. The conveyance of any such island may be made without survey: Provided, however, That such island may be surveyed at the request of the applicant State or its political subdivision if such State or subdivision donates money or services to the Secretary for such survey, the Secretary accepts such money or services, and such services are conducted pursuant to criteria established by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. Any such island so surveyed shall not be conveyed without approval of such survey by the Secretary prior to the conveyance.

    (b) __Omitted lands; authorization and limitations on authority__ 

        (1) The Secretary is authorized to convey to States and their political subdivisions under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act \[[43 U.S.C. 869][/us/usc/t43/s869] to 869–4\], but without regard to the acreage limitations contained therein, lands other than islands determined by him after survey to be public lands of the United States erroneously or fraudulently omitted from the original surveys (hereinafter referred to as “omitted lands”). Any such conveyance shall not be made without a survey: Provided, That the prospective recipient may donate money or services to the Secretary for the surveying necessary prior to conveyance if the Secretary accepts such money or services, such services are conducted pursuant to criteria established by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, and such survey is approved by the Secretary prior to the conveyance.

        (2) The Secretary is authorized to convey to the occupant of any omitted lands which, after survey, are found to have been occupied and developed for a five-year period prior to January 1, 1975, if the Secretary determines that such conveyance is in the public interest and will serve objectives which outweigh all public objectives and values which would be served by retaining such lands in Federal ownership. Conveyance under this subparagraph shall be made at not less than the fair market value of the land, as determined by the Secretary, and upon payment in addition of administrative costs, including the cost of making the survey, the cost of appraisal, and the cost of making the conveyance.

    (c) __Conformity with land use plans and programs and coordination with State and local governments of conveyances__

        (2) The provisions of [section 1720 of this title][/us/usc/t43/s1720] shall be applicable to all conveyances under this section.

    (e) __Limitations on uses of conveyed lands__ 

        No conveyance pursuant to this section shall be used as the basis for determining the baseline between Federal and State ownership, the boundary of any State for purposes of determining the extent of a State’s submerged lands or the line of demarcation of Federal jurisdiction, or any similar or related purpose.

    (f) __Applicability to lands within National Forest System, National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, and National Wild and Scenic Rivers System__ 

        The provisions of this section shall not apply to any lands within the National Forest System, defined in the Act of August 17, 1974 ([88 Stat. 476][/us/stat/88/476]; [16 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t16/s1601]), the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
