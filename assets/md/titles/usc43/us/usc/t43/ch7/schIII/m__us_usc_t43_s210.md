## § 210. Recognition of equitable claims on certain lands in Oklahoma; validation of homestead entries

    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to recognize equitable claims to such lands based on settlement made prior to January 1, 1934, and all homestead entries of such lands, the allowance of which was erroneous because the lands were not subject to entry, and all suspended entries and applications to make final proof, are validated if otherwise regular, as of the date of the regular application.
