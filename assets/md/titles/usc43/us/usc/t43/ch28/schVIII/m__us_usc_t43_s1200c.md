## § 1200c. Submission of contracts and reports covering disagreements on condemnation of Sioux lands for dam purposes; ratification; effect

    Each contract negotiated pursuant to this subchapter shall be submitted to the Congress for approval. The Chief of Engineers, Department of the Army, and the Secretary of the Interior are requested to submit such contract within one year from July 6, 1954. If the negotiating parties are unable to agree on a proposed contract each party shall submit to the Congress separate detailed reports of the negotiations, together with their recommendations. In the event the negotiating parties are unable to agree on any provision in the proposed contracts such provision shall be included in an appendix to the contract, together with the views of each party, for consideration and determination by Congress. The contract shall not take effect unless, after determination of any disputed provision, it is ratified by Act of Congress and is ratified within six months after such action by the Congress by a majority of the adult members of the tribe: Provided, That when so ratified the contract shall constitute a taking by the United States as of the date the contract was signed by the Chief of Engineers, Department of the Army, and the Secretary of the Interior, for purposes of determining the ownership of the Indian tribal, allotted, and assigned lands and interests therein.
