## § 423h. Delivery of water to excess lands upon death of spouse

    Where the death of a husband or wife causes lands in private ownership to become excess lands, as that term is used in [section 423e of this title][/us/usc/t43/s423e], and those lands had theretofore been eligible to receive water from a project under the Federal reclamation laws (Act of June 17, 1902 ([32 Stat. 388][/us/stat/32/388]), and Acts amendatory thereto) without execution of a recordable contract under [section 423e of this title][/us/usc/t43/s423e], the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to furnish water to them, without requiring execution of such a contract, so long as they remain in the ownership of the surviving spouse: Provided, That in the event of the remarriage of the surviving spouse, such lands shall be governed by applicable law without regard to the provisions of this section.

([Pub. L. 86–684][/us/pl/86/684], Sept. 2, 1960, [74 Stat. 732][/us/stat/74/732].)
