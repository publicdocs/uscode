            Not later than 1 year after March 30, 2009, the Secretary in consultation with transferred works operating entities shall develop, consistent with existing transfer contracts, specific inspection guidelines for project facilities which are in proximity to urbanized areas and which could pose a risk to public safety or property damage if such project facilities were to fail.

        (2) __Conduct of inspections__ 

            Not later than 3 years after March 30, 2009, the Secretary shall conduct inspections of those project facilities, which are in proximity to urbanized areas and which could pose a risk to public safety or property damage if such facilities were to fail, using such specific inspection guidelines and criteria developed pursuant to paragraph (1). In selecting project facilities to inspect, the Secretary shall take into account the potential magnitude of public safety and economic damage posed by each project facility.

        (3) __Treatment of costs__ 

            The costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting these inspections shall be nonreimbursable.

    (b) __Use of inspection data__ 

    The Secretary shall use the data collected through the conduct of the inspections under subsection (a)(2) to—

        (2) determine an appropriate inspection frequency for such nondam project facilities which shall not exceed 6 years; and

        (3) provide, upon request of transferred work operating entities, local governments, or State agencies, information regarding potential hazards posed by existing or proposed residential, commercial, industrial or public-use development adjacent to project facilities.
