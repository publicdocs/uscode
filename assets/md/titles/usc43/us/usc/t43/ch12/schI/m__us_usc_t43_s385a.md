## § 385a. Payments to school districts for education of dependents of construction personnel; cooperative arrangements; chargeable to project

    The Secretary of the Interior, giving due consideration to the temporary nature of the requirements therefor, is authorized to make such provision as he deems to be necessary and in the public interest for the education of dependents of persons employed on the actual construction of projects or features of projects, by the Bureau of Reclamation, in any cases in which he finds that by reason of such construction activity, an undue burden is, or will be cast upon the facilities of the public-school districts serving the areas in which construction is being undertaken, and to pay for the same from any funds available for the construction of said projects: Provided, That the Secretary of the Interior shall enter into cooperative arrangements with local school districts wherein such features are situated to contribute toward covering the cost of furnishing the educational services required for such dependents, or for the operation by those school districts of Government facilities, or for the expansion of local school facilities. Such cost incurred hereunder shall be charged to the project concerned and shall be repayable in the same manner and to the same extent as are its other costs of construction.
