    (a) __Ownership and pricing limitations inapplicable when repayment obligation has been discharged__ 

        The ownership and full cost pricing limitations of this subchapter and the ownership limitations provided in any other provision of Federal reclamation law shall not apply to lands in a district after the obligation of a district for the repayment of the construction costs of the project facilities used to make project water available for delivery to such lands shall have been discharged by a district (or by a person within the district pursuant to a contract existing on October 12, 1982), by payment of periodic installments throughout a specified contract term, including individual or district accelerated payments where so provided in contracts existing on October 12, 1982.

    (b) __Certification of freedom from ownership and pricing limitations__

Such certificate shall be in a form suitable for entry in the land records of the county in which such landholding is located.

        (2) Any certificate issued by the Secretary prior to October 12, 1982, acknowledging that the landholding is free of the acreage limitation of Federal reclamation law is hereby ratified.
