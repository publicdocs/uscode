## § 421c. Conditions of loan for distribution and drainage systems; reconveyance by Secretary of lands, interests in lands, and distribution works heretofore conveyed to the United States; conditions of reconveyance; rights of way

    The Secretary shall require, as conditions to any such loan, that the borrower contribute in money or materials, labor, lands, or interests in land, computed at their reasonable value, a portion not in excess of 10 per centum, of the construction cost of the distribution and drainage system (including all costs of acquiring lands and interests in land), that the plans for the system be in accord with sound engineering practices and be such as will achieve the purposes for which the system was authorized, and that the borrower agree to account in full in regard to all disbursements of borrowed funds and to return at once for application toward amortization of the loan all funds which are not expended in the construction of the distribution and drainage system. Every organization contracting for repayment of a loan under sections 421a to 421h of this title shall operate and maintain its distribution and drainage works in conformity with reasonable contractual requirements determined to be appropriate for the protection of the United States. The Secretary is hereby authorized to reconvey to borrowers all lands or interests in lands and distribution works transferred to the United States under the provisions of sections 421a to 421h of this title: Provided, That any reconveyance shall be upon the condition that the repayment contract of the borrower be amended to include such provisions as the Secretary shall deem necessary or proper to provide assurance of and security for prompt repayment of the loan. The head of any department or agency of the Government within whose administrative jurisdiction are lands owned by the United States the use of which is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of distribution and drainage works under sections 421a to 421h of this title may grant to a borrower or prospective borrower under sections 421a to 421h of this title revocable permission for the use thereof in like manner as under sections 79 and 524 of title 16, sections 323 to 328 of title 25, [section 8124 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s8124], or sections 931a to 931d, 946 to 950, 956, and 959 of this title, or any other similar Act which is applicable to the lands involved: Provided, That no such permission shall be granted in the case of lands being administered for national park, national monument, or wildlife purposes.

 __Codification__ 

    “[Section 8124 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s8124]” substituted in text (see 1991 Amendment note below) for “[section 5024 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5024]”, which previously had been substituted for “[section 5014 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5014]” as the probable intent of Congress in view of the renumbering of [section 5014 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5014] as section 5024 by [Pub. L. 96–22, title III, § 301(b)(1)][/us/pl/96/22/s301/b/1], June 13, 1979, [93 Stat. 61][/us/stat/93/61]. Previously, “[section 5014 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5014]” had been substituted for “[section 11i of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s11i]” on authority of [Pub. L. 85–857, § 5(a)][/us/pl/85/857/s5/a], Sept. 2, 1958, [72 Stat. 1281][/us/stat/72/1281], the first section of which enacted Title 38, Veterans’ Benefits.

 __Amendments__ 

    1991—[Pub. L. 102–40][/us/pl/102/40] substituted “[section 8124 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s8124]” for “[section 5024 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s5024]”. See Codification note above.

    1972—[Pub. L. 92–487][/us/pl/92/487] inserted provision subjecting drainage systems to the requirements of this section, substituted provisions authorizing the Secretary to reconvey to borrowers all land or interests in land and distribution works transferred to the United States under the provisions of sections 421a to 421h of this title, with the proviso relating to the amendment of the repayment contract, for provisions requiring borrowers, prior to the consummation of any loan, to transfer to the United States any lands or interests in lands presently held or acquired in the future which the Secretary finds necessary for the construction, operation, or maintenance of distribution systems, with title to all such lands, etc., subject to retransfer to the borrower by the Secretary upon repayment of the loan, to remain in the United States, and struck out provisions which restricted applicability of provisions to provisions relating to Federal reclamation laws.

    1956—Act May 14, 1956, provided that the Secretary, as conditions to loan, require borrower to account for disbursements of borrowed funds and return for application toward amortization of the loan all funds not expended in the construction of the distribution system, required, prior to the consummation of any loan, the transfer to the United States of titles to lands or interests in lands held by the borrower, and that titles to such lands, interests, and distribution works remain in United States until repayment, and provided for issuance of revocable permits for the use of lands owned by United States, in lieu of the formerly authorized actual conveyance to the districts of the rights-of-way.
