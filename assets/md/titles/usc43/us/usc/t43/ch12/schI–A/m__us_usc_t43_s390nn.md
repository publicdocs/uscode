## § 390nn. Trusts

    (a) The ownership and full cost pricing limitations of this subchapter and the ownership limitations provided in any other provision of Federal reclamation law shall not apply to lands in a district which are held by an individual or corporate trustee in a fiduciary capacity for a beneficiary or beneficiaries whose interests in the lands served do not exceed the ownership and pricing limitations imposed by Federal reclamation law, including this subchapter.

    (b)

     Lands placed in a revocable trust shall be attributable to the grantor if—
