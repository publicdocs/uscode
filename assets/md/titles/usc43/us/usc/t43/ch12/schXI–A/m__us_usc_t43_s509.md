The report required to be submitted by this section will consist of a finding by the Secretary of the Interior to the effect that modifications are required to be made to insure the safety of an existing dam. Such finding shall be accompanied by a technical report containing information on the need for structural modification, the corrective action deemed to be required, alternative solutions to structural modification that were considered, the estimated cost of needed modifications, and environmental impacts if any resulting from the implementation of the recommended plan of modification. For modification expenditures between $1,800,000 and $20,000,000 (October 1, 2015, price levels), the Secretary of the Interior shall, at least 30 days before the date on which the funds are expended, submit written notice of the expenditures to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate that provides a summary of the project, the cost of the project, and any alternatives that were considered.
