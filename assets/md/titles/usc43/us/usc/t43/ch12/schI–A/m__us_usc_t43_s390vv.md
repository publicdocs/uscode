    Within one year of October 12, 1982, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the cooperation of the Secretary of the Interior, shall transmit to the Congress a report on the production of surplus crops on acreage served by irrigation water. The report shall include—

        (1) data delineating the production of surplus crops on lands served by irrigation water;

        (2) the percentage of participation of farms served by irrigation water in set-aside programs, by acreage, crop, and State;

        (3) the feasibility and appropriateness of requiring the participation in acreage set-aside programs of farms served by irrigation water and the costs of such a requirement; and

        (4) any recommendations concerning how to coordinate national reclamation policy with agriculture policy to help alleviate recurring problems of surplus crops and low commodity prices.

    (b) __Restrictions prohibiting delivery of irrigation water for production of excess basic agricultural commodities__ 

        In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of any Federal reclamation project authorized before October 12, 1982, any restriction prohibiting the delivery of irrigation water for the production of excess basic agricultural commodities shall extend for a period no longer than ten years after the date of the initial authorization of such project.
