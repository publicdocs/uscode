## § 2424. Defaults

    (a) __Payments by Secretary__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            If a borrower defaults on the obligation, the holder of the loan guarantee shall have the right to demand payment of the unpaid amount from the Secretary.

        (2) __Payment required__ 

            By such date as may be specified in the loan guarantee or related agreements, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the loan guarantee the unpaid interest on, and unpaid principal of, the obligation with respect to which the borrower has defaulted, unless the Secretary finds that there was not default by the borrower in the payment of interest or principal or that the default has been remedied.

        (3) __Forbearance__ 

            Nothing in this subsection precludes any forbearance by the holder of the obligation for the benefit of the non-Federal borrower that may be agreed on by the parties to the obligation and approved by the Secretary.

    (b) __Subrogation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        If the Secretary makes a payment under subsection (a), the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the recipient of the payment as specified in the loan guarantee or related agreements, including, as appropriate, the authority (notwithstanding any other provision of law) to—

            (A) complete, maintain, operate, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property acquired pursuant to the loan guarantee or related agreements; or

            (B) permit the non-Federal borrower, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, to continue to pursue the purposes of the project if the Secretary determines the purposes to be in the public interest.

        (2) __Superiority of rights__ 

            The rights of the Secretary, with respect to any property acquired pursuant to a loan guarantee or related agreement, shall be superior to the rights of any other person with respect to the property.

    (c) __Payment of principal and interest by Secretary__ 

    With respect to any obligation guaranteed under this section, the Secretary may enter into a contract to pay, and pay, holders of the obligation, for and on behalf of the non-Federal borrower, from funds appropriated for that purpose, the principal and interest payments that become due and payable on the unpaid balance of the obligation if the Secretary finds that—

        (1)

            (A) the non-Federal borrower is unable to meet the payments and is not in default;

            (B) it is in the public interest to permit the non-Federal borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of the project; and

            (C) the probable net benefit to the Federal Government in paying the principal and interest will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default;

        (2) the amount of the payment that the Secretary is authorized to pay shall be no greater than the amount of principal and interest that the non-Federal borrower is obligated to pay under the agreement being guaranteed; and

        (3) the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary for the payment (including interest) on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Secretary.

    (d) __Action by Attorney General__ 

        (1) __Notification__ 

            If the non-Federal borrower defaults on an obligation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of the default.

        (2) __Recovery__ 

        On notification, the Attorney General shall take such action as is appropriate to recover the unpaid principal and interest due from—

            (A) such assets of the defaulting non-Federal borrower as are associated with the obligation; or

            (B) any other security pledged to secure the obligation.
