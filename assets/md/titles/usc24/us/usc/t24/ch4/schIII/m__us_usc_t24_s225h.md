## § 225h. Buy American provisions

    (a) __Applicability__ 

        The Mayor shall insure that the requirements of the Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, apply to all procurements made under this subchapter.

    (b) __Determination by Mayor__ 

        (1) If the Mayor, after consultation with the United States Trade Representative, determines that a foreign country which is party to an agreement described in paragraph (2) has violated the terms of the agreement by discriminating against certain types of products produced in the United States that are covered by the agreement, the United States Trade Representative shall rescind the waiver of the Buy American Act with respect to such types of products produced in that foreign country.

        (2) An agreement referred to in paragraph (1) is any agreement, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  between the United States and a foreign country pursuant to which the head of an agency of the United States Government has waived the requirements of the Buy American Act with respect to certain products produced in the foreign country.

    (c) __Report to Congress__ 

        The Mayor shall submit to Congress a report on the amount of purchases from foreign entities under this subchapter from foreign entities in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Such report shall separately indicate the dollar value of items for which the Buy American Act was waived pursuant to any agreement described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Trade Agreement Act of 1979 ([19 U.S.C. 2501][/us/usc/t19/s2501] et seq.), or any international agreement to which the United States is a party.

    (d) __“Buy American Act” defined__ 

        For purposes of this section, the term “Buy American Act” means title III of the Act entitled “An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes”, approved March 3, 1933 ([41 U.S.C. 10a][/us/usc/t41/s10a] et seq.)  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup> .

    (e) __Restrictions on contract awards__ 

        No contract or subcontract made with funds authorized under this subchapter 2 may be awarded for the procurement of an article, material, or supply produced or manufactured in a foreign country whose government unfairly maintains in government procurement a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses, as identified by the President pursuant to  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by “subsection”. </sup></sup>  (g)(1)(A) of section 305 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([19 U.S.C. 2515(g)(1)(A)][/us/usc/t19/s2515/g/1/A]). Any such determination shall be made in accordance with section 305.

    (f) __Prohibition against fraudulent use of “Made in America” labels__ 

        If it has been finally determined by a court or Federal agency that any person intentionally affixed a label bearing a “Made in America” inscription, or any inscription with the same meaning, to any product sold in or shipped to the United States that is not made in the United States, that person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract under this subchapter, pursuant to the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility procedures in subpart 9.4 of chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.

([Pub. L. 98–621, § 11][/us/pl/98/621/s11], as added [Pub. L. 102–150, § 4(2)][/us/pl/102/150/s4/2], Oct. 31, 1991, [105 Stat. 981][/us/stat/105/981].)

 __References in Text__ 

    Title III of the Act entitled “An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes”, approved March 3, 1933, referred to in subsec. (d), is title III of [act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212][/us/act/1933-03-03/ch212], [47 Stat. 1520][/us/stat/47/1520], known as the Buy American Act, which was classified generally to sections 10a, 10b, and 10c of former Title 41, Public Contracts, and was substantially repealed and restated in chapter 83 (§ 8301 et seq.) of Title 41, Public Contracts, by [Pub. L. 111–350][/us/pl/111/350], §§ 3, 7(b), Jan. 4, 2011, [124 Stat. 3677][/us/stat/124/3677], 3855. For complete classification of title III to the Code, see Short Title of 1933 Act note set out under [section 101 of Title 41][/us/usc/t41/s101] and Tables. For disposition of sections of former Title 41, see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of Title 41][/us/usc/t41/s101].

    The Trade Agreement Act of 1979, referred to in subsec. (c), probably means the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, [Pub. L. 96–39][/us/pl/96/39], July 26, 1979, [93 Stat. 144][/us/stat/93/144], as amended. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see References in Text note set out under [section 2501 of Title 19][/us/usc/t19/s2501], Customs Duties, and Tables.

    This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original “this title” and was translated as reading “this Act”, meaning [Pub. L. 98–621][/us/pl/98/621], which is classified principally to this subchapter, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [Pub. L. 98–621][/us/pl/98/621] does not contain titles.
