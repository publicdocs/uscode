## § 8105. Waiver

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    The head of an agency may waive a suspension of payments, termination of the contract or grant, or suspension or debarment of a contractor or grantee under this chapter with respect to a particular contract or grant if—

        (1) in the case of a contract, the head of the agency determines under [section 8102(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t41/s8102/b/1], after a final determination is issued under section 8102(b)(1), that suspension of payments, termination of the contract, suspension or debarment of the contractor, or refusal to permit a person to be treated as a responsible source for a contract would severely disrupt the operation of the agency to the detriment of the Federal Government or the general public; or

        (2) in the case of a grant, the head of the agency determines that suspension of payments, termination of the grant, or suspension or debarment of the grantee would not be in the public interest.

    (b)  __Waiver Authority May Not Be Delegated__  __.—__ 

    The authority of the head of an agency under this section to waive a suspension, termination, or debarment shall not be delegated.
