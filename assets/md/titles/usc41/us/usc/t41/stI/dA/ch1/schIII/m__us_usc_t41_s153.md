    In paragraph (1), the words “a contingency operation or”, and the text of [41 U.S.C. 259(d)(2)(A)][/us/usc/t41/s259/d/2/A], are omitted because the increased simplified acquisition threshold established under section 32A of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([Public Law 93–400][/us/pl/93/400]) in the case of a contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States in support of a contingency operation supersedes the threshold established under this section. Section 32A is restated as section 1903 of the revised title.
