## § 3901. Contracts awarded using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures

    (a) __Authorized Types.—__ 

    Except as provided in [section 3905 of this title][/us/usc/t41/s3905], contracts awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures may be of any type which in the opinion of the agency head will promote the best interests of the Federal Government.

    (b) __Required Warranty.—__ 

        (1) __Content.—__ 

        Every contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the contract on an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except for bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies the contractor maintains to secure business.

        (2) __Remedy for breach or violation.—__ 

        For the breach or violation of the warranty, the Federal Government may annul the contract without liability or deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of the commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.

        (3) __Nonapplication.—__ 

        Paragraph (1) does not apply to a contract for an amount that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.
