## § 3105. New contracts and grants and merit-based selection procedures

    (a) __Congressional Policy.—__ 

    It is the policy of Congress that—

        (1)

         an executive agency should not be required by legislation to award—

            (A) a new contract to a specific non-Federal Government entity; or

            (B) a new grant for research, development, test, or evaluation to a non-Federal Government entity; and

        (2) a program, project, or technology identified in legislation be procured or awarded through merit-based selection procedures.

    (b) __New Contract and New Grant Described.—__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) a contract is a new contract unless the work provided for in the contract is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a prior contract; and

        (2) a grant is a new grant unless the work provided for in the grant is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a prior grant.

    (c) __Requirements for Awarding New Contract or New Grant.—__ 

    A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new contract or a new grant to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless the provision of law specifically—

        (1) refers to this section;

        (2) identifies the particular non-Federal Government entity involved; and

        (3) states that the award to that entity is required by the provision of law in contravention of the policy set forth in subsection (a).

    (d) __Exception.—__ 

    This section does not apply to a contract or grant that calls on the National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or experiment on a subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to Congress or an agency of the Federal Government.
