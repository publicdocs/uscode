            (B) performance required; or

            (B) before soliciting bids or proposals for a contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.

        (2) __Use of results.—__ 

        The head of an executive agency shall use the results of market research to determine whether commercial items or, to the extent that commercial items suitable to meet the executive agency’s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial items are available that—

            (A) meet the executive agency’s requirements;

            (B) could be modified to meet the executive agency’s requirements; or

            (C) could meet the executive agency’s requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent.
