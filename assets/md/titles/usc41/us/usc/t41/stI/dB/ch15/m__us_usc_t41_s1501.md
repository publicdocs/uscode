    In subsection (b)(2), the text of 41:422(a)(2)(C) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (b)(2)(A), the last sentence is substituted for “of the initial members, two shall be appointed for terms of two years, one shall be appointed for a term of three years, and one shall be appointed for a term of four years” because the initial members have already been appointed.

In subsection (c)(2), the reference to [section 5376 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5376] is substituted for the reference to grade GS–18 of the General Schedule because of section 529 \[title I, § 101(c)(1)\] of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 ([Public Law 101–509][/us/pl/101/509], [104 Stat. 1442][/us/stat/104/1442], 5:5376 note).

    In subsection (f)(1), the words “Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section” are omitted because 41:422(a) does not provide any relevant exception.

    In subsection (f)(2), the words “private sector” are substituted for “private life” for consistency with subsection (b)(1)(B) of the revised section.

    In subsection (f)(3), the words “Executive Schedule” are substituted for “Federal Executive Salary Schedule under [section 5316 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5316]” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    In subsec. (c)(2), “for level IV of the Executive Schedule” substituted for “under [section 5376 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5376]” by S. Amdt. 4726 (111th Cong.). See 156 Cong. Rec. 18682 (2010).
