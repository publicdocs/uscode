    (a)  __Notice Requirement__  __.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b)—

        (1) an executive agency intending to solicit bids or proposals for a contract for property or services for a price expected to exceed $10,000, but not to exceed $25,000, shall post, for not less than 10 days, in a public place at the contracting office issuing the solicitation a notice of solicitation described in subsection (c);

        (2)

         an executive agency shall publish a notice of solicitation described in subsection (c) if the agency intends to—

            (A) solicit bids or proposals for a contract for property or services for a price expected to exceed $25,000; or

            (B) place an order, expected to exceed $25,000, under a basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or similar arrangement; and

        (3) an executive agency awarding a contract for property or services for a price exceeding $25,000, or placing an order exceeding $25,000 under a basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or similar arrangement, shall furnish for publication a notice announcing the award or order if there is likely to be a subcontract under the contract or order.

    (b) __Exemptions.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        A notice is not required under subsection (a) if—

            (A)

                (ii) permitting the public to respond to the solicitation electronically;

            (B) the notice would disclose the executive agency’s needs and disclosure would compromise national security;

            (C)

             the proposed procurement would result from acceptance of—

                (i) an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative research concept and publication of a notice of the unsolicited research proposal would disclose the originality of thought or innovativeness of the proposal or would disclose proprietary information associated with the proposal; or

                (ii) a proposal submitted under section 9 of the Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 638][/us/usc/t15/s638]);

        (1)

         an accurate description of the property or services to be contracted for, which description—

            (A) shall not be unnecessarily restrictive of competition; and

            (B) shall include, as appropriate, the agency nomenclature, National Stock Number or other part number, and a brief description of the item’s form, fit, or function, physical dimensions, predominant material of manufacture, or similar information that will assist a prospective contractor to make an informed business judgment as to whether a copy of the solicitation should be requested;

        (4) a statement that all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as appropriate) that the agency shall consider;

        (5) in the case of a procurement using procedures other than competitive procedures, a statement of the reason justifying the use of those procedures and the identity of the intended source; and

        (6)

         in the case of a contract in an amount estimated to be greater than $25,000 but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, or a contract for the procurement of commercial items using special simplified procedures—

                (ii) in the case of an order under a basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or similar arrangement, is earlier than 30 days after the date the notice required for an order described in subsection (a)(2)(B) is published; or

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “under a basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or similar arrangement” are substituted for “referred to in clause (A)(ii)” for clarity. The words “by the Secretary of Commerce” are omitted as obsolete. The Secretary of Commerce no longer has responsibility for publishing notices of awards or orders. See revision note for subsection (d).

    In subsection (b)(2), the text of [41 U.S.C. 416(C)(1)(H)][/us/usc/t41/s416/C/1/H] is omitted because the procurement authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to the special procedures provided in section 833(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ([6 U.S.C. 339(c)][/us/usc/t6/s339/c]) expired on September 30, 2007.

Subsection (b)(3) is added because of section 850(e)(3) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 ([Public Law 105–85][/us/pl/105/85], [111 Stat. 1849][/us/stat/111/1849], 15:637 note), which in part provided that the amendments made by section 850(e)(2), which amended 41:416(c)(1), be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable international agreements.

    Subsection (d) is substituted for 41:416(a)(2) and (7) to eliminate unnecessary words. Federal Business Opportunities is the designated single point of universal electronic public access for publication of all procurement information and notices previously published by the Secretary of Commerce in the Commerce Business Daily. See 66 Fed. Reg. 27407, May 16, 2001, 68 Fed. Reg. 56678, October 1, 2003, 48 CFR ch. 1, subch. B, part 5, and the special notice posted in CBDNet on December 28, 2001, and printed on January 2, 2002.

    In subsection (e)(1)(B)(i), the words “required for a bid or proposal for a contract described in” are substituted for “required by” for clarity.

    In subsection (e)(1)(B)(ii), the words “required for an order described in” are substituted for “required by” for clarity.

 __Applicability to Tennessee Valley Authority__ 

[Pub. L. 98–577, title III][/us/pl/98/577/tIII], § 303(c), Oct. 30, 1984, [98 Stat. 3079][/us/stat/98/3079], provided that: 

> “The provisions of the amendments made by subsection (a) of this section \[see Tables for classification\] shall apply to the Tennessee Valley Authority only with respect to procurements to be paid from appropriated funds.”
