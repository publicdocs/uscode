## § 4506. Action in case of fraud

    (a)  __Definition__  __.—__ 

    In this section, the term “remedy coordination official”, with respect to an executive agency, means the individual or entity in that executive agency who coordinates within that executive agency the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.

    (b)  __Recommendation To Reduce or Suspend Payments__  __.—__ 

    In any case in which the remedy coordination official of an executive agency finds that there is substantial evidence that the request of a contractor for advance, partial, or progress payment under a contract awarded by that executive agency is based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the executive agency reduce or suspend further payments to that contractor.

    (c)  __Reduction or Suspension of Payments__  __.—__ 

    The head of an executive agency receiving a recommendation under subsection (b) in the case of a contractor’s request for payment under a contract shall determine whether there is substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud. On making an affirmative determination, the head of the executive agency may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under the contract.

    (d)  __Extent of Reduction or Suspension__  __.—__ 

    The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by an executive agency under subsection (c) on the basis of fraud shall be reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the Federal Government resulting from the fraud.

    (e)  __Written Justification__  __.—__ 

    A written justification for each decision of the head of an executive agency whether to reduce or suspend payments under subsection (c), and for each recommendation received by the executive agency in connection with the decision, shall be prepared and be retained in the files of the executive agency.

    (f)  __Notice__  __.—__ 

    The head of each executive agency shall prescribe procedures to ensure that, before the head of the executive agency decides to reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under subsection (c), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the executive agency in response to the proposed reduction or suspension.

    (g)  __Review__  __.—__ 

    Not later than 180 days after the date on which the head of an executive agency reduces or suspends payments to a contractor under subsection (c), the remedy coordination official of the executive agency shall—

        (1) review the determination of fraud on which the reduction or suspension is based; and

        (2) transmit a recommendation to the head of the executive agency whether the suspension or reduction should continue.

    (h)  __Report__  __.—__ 

    The head of each executive agency who receives recommendations made by the remedy coordination official of the executive agency to reduce or suspend payments under subsection (c) during a fiscal year shall prepare for that year a report that contains the recommendations, the actions taken on the recommendations and the reasons for those actions, and an assessment of the effects of those actions on the Federal Government. The report shall be available to any Member of Congress on request.

    (i)  __Restriction on Delegation__  __.—__ 

    The head of an executive agency may not delegate responsibilities under this section to an individual in a position below level IV of the Executive Schedule.
