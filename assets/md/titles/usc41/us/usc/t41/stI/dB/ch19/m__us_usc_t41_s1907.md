## § 1907. List of laws inapplicable to procurements of commercially available off-the-shelf items

    (a) __Inclusion in Federal Acquisition Regulation.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include a list of provisions of law that are inapplicable to contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items. A provision of law properly included on the list pursuant to paragraph (2) does not apply to contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items. This section does not render a provision of law not included on the list inapplicable to contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items.

        (2)  __Laws to be included__  __.—__ 

        A provision of law described in subsection (b) shall be included on the list of inapplicable provisions of law required by paragraph (1) unless the Administrator makes a written determination that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items from the applicability of the provision.

        (3)  __Other authorities or responsibilities not affected__  __.—__ 

        This section does not modify, supersede, impair, or restrict authorities or responsibilities under—

            (A) section 15 of the Small Business Act ([15 U.S.C. 644][/us/usc/t15/s644]); or

            (B)

             bid protest procedures developed under the authority of—

                (i) subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31;

                (ii) section 2305(e) and (f) of title 10; or

                (iii) sections 3706 and 3707 of this title.

    (b)  __Covered Law__  __.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (a)(3), a provision of law referred to in subsection (a)(1) is a provision of law that the Administrator determines imposes Federal Government-unique policies, procedures, requirements, or restrictions for the procurement of property or services on persons whom the Federal Government has awarded contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items, except for a provision of law that—

        (1) provides for criminal or civil penalties; or

        (2) specifically refers to this section and provides that, notwithstanding this section, it shall be applicable to contracts for the procurement of commercially available off-the-shelf items.
