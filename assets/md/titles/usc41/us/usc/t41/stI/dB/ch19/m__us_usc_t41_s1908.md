    (b) __Application.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the requirement for adjustment under subsection (c) applies to a dollar threshold that is specified in law as a factor in defining the scope of the applicability of a policy, procedure, requirement, or restriction provided in that law to the procurement of property or services by an executive agency, as the Council determines.

        (2)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

        Subsection (c) does not apply to dollar thresholds—

            (C) the United States Trade Representative establishes pursuant to title III of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 ([19 U.S.C. 2511][/us/usc/t19/s2511] et seq.).

        (3)  __Relationship to other inflation adjustment authorities__  __.—__ 

        This section supersedes the applicability of other provisions of law that provide for the adjustment of a dollar threshold that is adjustable under this section.

    (c) __Requirement for Periodic Adjustment.—__ 

        (1)  __Baseline constant dollar value__  __.—__ 

        For purposes of paragraph (2), the baseline constant dollar value for a dollar threshold—

            (A) in effect on October 1, 2000, that was first specified in a law that took effect on or before October 1, 2000, is the October 1, 2000, constant dollar value of that dollar threshold; and

            (B) specified in a law that takes effect after October 1, 2000, is the constant dollar value of that threshold as of the effective date of that dollar threshold pursuant to that law.

        (2)  __Adjustment__  __.—__ 

        On October 1 of each year evenly divisible by 5, the Council shall adjust each acquisition-related dollar threshold provided by law, as described in subsection (b)(1), to the baseline constant dollar value of that threshold.

        (3)  __Exclusive means of adjustment__  __.—__ 

        A dollar threshold adjustable under this section shall be adjusted only as provided in this section.

    (d)  __Publication__  __.—__ 

    The Council shall publish a notice of the adjusted dollar thresholds under this section in the Federal Register. The thresholds take effect on the date of publication.

    (e)  __Calculation__  __.—__ 

    An adjustment under this section shall be—

        (1) calculated on the basis of changes in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published monthly by the Secretary of Labor; and

        (2)

         rounded, in the case of a dollar threshold that on the day before the adjustment is—

            (A) less than $10,000, to the nearest $500;

            (B) not less than $10,000, but less than $100,000, to the nearest $5,000;

            (C) not less than $100,000, but less than $1,000,000, to the nearest $50,000; and

            (D) $1,000,000 or more, to the nearest $500,000.

    (f) __Petition for Inclusion of Omitted Threshold.—__ 

        (1)  __Petition submitted to administrator__  __.—__ 

        A person may request adjustment of a dollar threshold adjustable under this section that is not included in a notice of adjustment published under subsection (d) by submitting a petition for adjustment to the Administrator.

        (2)  __Actions of administrator__  __.—__ 

        On receipt of a petition for adjustment of a dollar threshold under paragraph (1), the Administrator—

            (A) shall determine, in writing, whether the dollar threshold is required to be adjusted under this section; and

            (B) on determining that it should be adjusted, shall publish in the Federal Register a revised notice of the adjustment dollar thresholds under this section that includes the adjustment of the dollar threshold covered by the petition.

        (3)  __Effective date of adjustment by petition__  __.—__ 

        The adjustment of a dollar threshold pursuant to a petition under this subsection takes effect on the date the revised notice adding the adjustment under paragraph (2)(B) is published.
