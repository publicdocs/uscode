    In subsection (a)(2), the reference to subsection (g) of section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 ([Public Law 103–160][/us/pl/103/160], [10 U.S.C. 2371][/us/usc/t10/s2371] note) is changed to subsection (i) because of section 847(c)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 ([Public Law 108–136][/us/pl/108/136], [117 Stat. 1554][/us/stat/117/1554]), which redesignated subsection (g) as subsection (h), and section 823(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 ([Public Law 109–163][/us/pl/109/163], [119 Stat. 3387][/us/stat/119/3387]), which redesignated subsection (h) as subsection (i).

    In subsection (a)(4)(A), the words “to use the authority for such project” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (c), the words “Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs” are substituted for “Committee on Governmental Affairs” on authority of Senate Resolution No. 445 (108th Congress, October 9, 2004). The words “Committee on Oversight and Government Reform” are substituted for “Committee on Government Reform” on authority of Rule X(1)(m) of the Rules of the House of Representatives, adopted by House Resolution No. 6 (110th Congress, January 5, 2007).
