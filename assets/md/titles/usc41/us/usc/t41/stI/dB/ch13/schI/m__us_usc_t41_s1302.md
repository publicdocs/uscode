    In subsection (a), the words “(hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘Council’)” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b)(2)(A)(i), the words “Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics” are substituted for “Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology” because of section 911(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 ([Public Law 106–65][/us/pl/106/65], [113 Stat. 717][/us/stat/113/717], [10 U.S.C. 133][/us/usc/t10/s133] note).

In subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii), the cross-reference to section 16(3) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41:414(3)) is treated as a cross-reference to section 16(c) of the Act to reflect the amendment of section 16 by section 1421(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 ([Public Law 108–136][/us/pl/108/136], [117 Stat. 1666][/us/stat/117/1666]).
