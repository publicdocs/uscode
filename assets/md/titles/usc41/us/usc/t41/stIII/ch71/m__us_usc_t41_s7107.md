In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words “may transmit” are substituted for “transmits” to correct the grammatical structure of the provision in accordance with the probable intent of Congress. The words “the decision” are substituted for “the decision of the board of contract appeals” and for “the board’s decision” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency with 41:607(g)(1)(A).

    In subsection (a)(2)(B), the words “in any case” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (d), the words “United States Court of Federal Claims” are substituted for “United States Claims Court” because of section 902(b)(1) of the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992 ([Pub. L. 102–572][/us/pl/102/572], [106 Stat. 4516][/us/stat/106/4516], [28 U.S.C. 171][/us/usc/t28/s171] note).

    In subsection (f)(1), (3), and (4), the words “agency board” are substituted for “board of contract appeals” to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency with the definition of “agency board” in section 7101 of the revised title.

    In subsection (f)(1), the words “under consideration” are substituted for “at issue” to avoid potential confusion with the words “issue described in paragraph (2)”.
