    In subsection (c), the words “an agency head” are substituted for “the head of the agency” for consistency with the defined term “agency head” in section 7101 of the revised title.

    In subsection (d), the words “chapter 309 or 311 of title 46” are substituted for “the Act of March 9, 1920, as amended ([41 Stat. 525][/us/stat/41/525], as amended; [46 U.S.C. 741–752][/us/usc/t46/s741–752]) or the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended ([43 Stat. 1112][/us/stat/43/1112], as amended; [46 U.S.C. 781–790][/us/usc/t46/s781–790])” in section 4 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 ([Public Law 95–563][/us/pl/95/563], [92 Stat. 2384][/us/stat/92/2384]) because of [section 18(c) of Public Law 109–304][/us/pl/109/304/s18/c] (46 U.S.C. note prec. 101).
