    A member of an agency board of contract appeals may administer oaths to witnesses, authorize depositions and discovery proceedings, and require by subpoena the attendance of witnesses, and production of books and papers, for the taking of testimony or evidence by deposition or in the hearing of an appeal by the agency board.

    An agency board shall—

        (1) to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes;

        (2) issue a decision in writing or take other appropriate action on each appeal submitted; and

        (3) mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the decision to the contractor and the contracting officer.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “administrative law judges” are substituted for “hearing examiners” because of [section 3 of Public Law 95–251][/us/pl/95/251/s3] ([5 U.S.C. 3105][/us/usc/t5/s3105] note). The words “Full-time members of agency boards serving as such on the effective date of this chapter shall be considered qualified” are omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (b), the text of [41 U.S.C. 438][/us/usc/t41/s438] (b)(1)(C) is omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (e)(1)(B) and (C), the words “Postal Regulatory Commission” are substituted for “Postal Rate Commission” because of section 604(f) of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act ([Public Law 109–435][/us/pl/109/435], [120 Stat. 3242][/us/stat/120/3242], [39 U.S.C. 404][/us/usc/t39/s404] note).

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 8 of the Contract Disputes Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(4)(B)(i), probably means [section 8 of Pub. L. 95–563][/us/pl/95/563/s8], the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, which was classified to former [section 607 of this title][/us/usc/t41/s607] prior to being repealed and reenacted as subsecs. (a), (c) to (e), and (g) of this section by [Pub. L. 111–350][/us/pl/111/350], §§ 3, 7(b), Jan. 4, 2011, [124 Stat. 3677][/us/stat/124/3677], 3855.
