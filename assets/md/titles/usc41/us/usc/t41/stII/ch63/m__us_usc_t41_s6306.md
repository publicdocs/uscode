    In subsection (b)(2), the words “Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933” and “Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation Act” are omitted because all provisions of those Acts have previously been executed or repealed.

    In subsection (b)(2)(B), the words “Farm Credit Act of 1971 ([12 U.S.C. 2001][/us/usc/t12/s2001] et seq.)” are substituted for “Federal Farm Loan Act” and “Farm Credit Act of 1933” because of section 5.40(a), formerly 5.26(a), of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 ([Pub. L. 92–181][/us/pl/92/181], [12 U.S.C. 2001][/us/usc/t12/s2001] note).

In subsection (b)(2)(C), the words “Home Owners’ Loan Act” are substituted for “Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933” because of the amendment to 12:1461 made by [Public Law 101–73][/us/pl/101/73].
