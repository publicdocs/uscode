    Paragraph (1) is substituted for “Title III of the act entitled ‘An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes’, approved May 3, 1933 (commonly known as the Buy American Act)” for consistency in the revised title and to correct an error in the source, which incorrectly gives May 3, 1933, rather than March 3, 1933, as the date of approval.

    Paragraph (2) is substituted for “the Act entitled ‘An Act relating to the rate of wages for laborers and mechanics employed on public buildings of the United States and the District of Columbia by contractors and subcontractors, and for other purposes’, approved March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the Bacon-Davis Act), as amended from time to time” because of [section 5(c) of Public Law 107–217][/us/pl/107/217/s5/c] (40 U.S.C. note prec. 101) and for consistency with title 40.

    The words “the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended” are omitted as obsolete because of [section 201 of the Act of June 21, 1938][/us/act/1938-06-21/s201] (ch. 554, [52 Stat. 816][/us/stat/52/816]), as amended by the Acts of June 27, 1940 (ch. 437, [54 Stat. 633][/us/stat/54/633]), April 5, 1941 (ch. 40, [55 Stat. 110][/us/stat/55/110]), and June 27, 1942 (ch. 450, [56 Stat. 410][/us/stat/56/410]).

    The words “or \[the labor provisions\] of section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935” are omitted as obsolete. The intended reference was probably to section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 ([49 Stat. 118][/us/stat/49/118]). Section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 provided that the President shall require certain rates of pay for persons engaged in carrying out projects that were financed by amounts being appropriated in that Act.

    Paragraph (3) is substituted for “the Act entitled ‘An Act to provide for the diversification of employment of Federal prisoners, for their training and schooling in trades and occupations, and for other purposes’, approved May 27, 1930, as amended and supplemented by the Act approved June 23, 1934” for consistency with title 18. The Act of May 27, 1930 (ch. 340, [46 Stat. 391][/us/stat/46/391]) and the Act of June 23, 1934 (ch. 736, [48 Stat. 1211][/us/stat/48/1211]), which were classified to sections 744a to 744n of former title 18, were substantially repealed and were replaced by chapter 307 and [section 4162 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s4162] in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, [62 Stat. 683][/us/stat/62/683]). Subsequently, [section 4162 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s4162] was repealed by [section 218(a)(4) of Public Law 98–473][/us/pl/98/473/s218/a/4] ([98 Stat. 2027][/us/stat/98/2027]).
