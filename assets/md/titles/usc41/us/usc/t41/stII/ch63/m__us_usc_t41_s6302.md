## § 6302. Contracts for fuel made by Secretary of the Army

    The Secretary of the Army, when the Secretary believes it is in the interest of the United States, may enter into contracts and incur obligations for fuel in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for one year without regard to the current fiscal year. Amounts appropriated for the fiscal year in which the contract is made or amounts appropriated or which may be appropriated for the following fiscal year may be used to pay for supplies delivered under a contract made pursuant to this section.

    The words “Secretary of the Army” are substituted for “Secretary of War” because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]). Section 205(a) was repealed by [section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956][/us/act/1956-08-10/s53] (ch. 1041, [70A Stat. 676][/us/stat/70A/676]). [Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956][/us/act/1956-08-10/s1] ([70A Stat. 1][/us/stat/70A/1]) enacted Title 10, “Armed Forces”, and under sections 3011 to 3013 of title 10, the Department of the Army remains under the administrative supervision of the Secretary of the Army.
