    In subsection (a), the words “an agency of the United States” are substituted for “any executive department, independent establishment, or other agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any corporation all the stock of which is beneficially owned by the United States” because of the definition in section 6501 of the revised title.
