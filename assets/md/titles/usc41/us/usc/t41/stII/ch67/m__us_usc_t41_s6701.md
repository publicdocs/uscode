    In paragraph (3), the word “individual” is substituted for “person” because of the definition of “person” in 1:1. The words “contract made by the Federal Government” are substituted for “contract entered into by the United States” for consistency in the revised title. The words “as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations” are omitted as obsolete.

    In paragraph (4)(A), the words “the outer Continental Shelf” are substituted for “Outer Continental Shelf lands” for consistency with the definition in 43:1331 and for consistency with the more common usage generally found in subchapter III of chapter 29 of title 43. The words “Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll” are omitted because they are part of the Marshall Islands and therefore no longer part of the United States. The words “Canton Island” are omitted because it is part of Kiribati and therefore no longer part of the United States.

(4)(A), is [act Aug. 7, 1953, ch. 345][/us/act/1953-08-07/ch345], [67 Stat. 462][/us/stat/67/462], which is classified generally to subchapter III (§ 1331 et seq.) of chapter 29 of Title 43, Public Lands.
