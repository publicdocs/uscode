## § 6307. Contracts with Federal Government-owned establishments and availability of appropriations

    An order or contract placed with a Federal Government-owned establishment for work, material, or the manufacture of material pertaining to an approved project is deemed to be an obligation in the same manner that a similar order or contract placed with a commercial manufacturer or private contractor is an obligation. Appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a Federal Government-owned establishment just as appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a commercial manufacturer or private contractor.

    The words “heretofore or” are omitted as obsolete. The word “hereafter” is omitted as unnecessary because the provision is restated as permanent law rather than as part of a fiscal year appropriation.
