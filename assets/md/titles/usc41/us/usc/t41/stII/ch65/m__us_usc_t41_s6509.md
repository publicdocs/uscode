    Subsection (a) is substituted for “Notwithstanding any provision of section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act, such Act shall be applicable in the administration of sections 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 of this Act” in [section 10 of the Act of June 30, 1936][/us/act/1936-06-30/s10] (ch. 881), for consistency in the revised title and because of [section 7(b) of Public Law 89–554][/us/pl/89/554/s7/b] (5 U.S.C. note prec. 101).

    In subsection (c), the words “has the right of judicial review” are substituted for “Review . . . may be had” for consistency with subsection (b) and with section 6510(b) of the revised title and because the review provided for in chapter 7 of title 5 is denominated as judicial review.
