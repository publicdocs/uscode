    In subsection (b)(2), the words “the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act ([49 Stat. 2036][/us/stat/49/2036])”, which appear in [section 7(2) of Public Law 89–286][/us/pl/89/286/s7/2] ([79 Stat. 1036][/us/stat/79/1036]), are treated as a reference to the Act of June 30, 1936 (ch. 881, [49 Stat. 2036][/us/stat/49/2036]), which was known as the Walsh-Healey Act and which was subsequently designated as the Walsh-Healey Act by [section 12 of the Act of June 30, 1936][/us/act/1936-06-30/s12], which was added by [section 10005(f)(5) of Public Law 103–355][/us/pl/103/355/s10005/f/5] ([108 Stat. 3409][/us/stat/108/3409]).

    In subsection (b)(7), the words “United States Postal Service” are substituted for “Post Office Department” because of sections 4(a) and 6(o) of the Postal Reorganization Act ([Public Law 91–375][/us/pl/91/375], [84 Stat. 773][/us/stat/84/773], 783, 39 U.S.C. note prec. 101, 201 note).

    The Communications Act of 1934, referred to in subsec. (b)(4), is [act June 19, 1934, ch. 652][/us/act/1934-06-19/ch652], [48 Stat. 1064][/us/stat/48/1064], which is classified principally to chapter 5 (§ 151 et seq.) of Title 47, Telecommunications.
