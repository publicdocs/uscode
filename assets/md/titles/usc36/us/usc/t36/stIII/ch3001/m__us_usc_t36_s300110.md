    In subsection (a), the words “make and”, “next preceding”, and “full” are omitted as unnecessary. The word “activities” is substituted for “proceedings” for consistency in the revised title. The words “all receipts and expenditures” are substituted for “receipts and expenditures of whatever kind” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsections (b) and (c), the word “Secretary” is substituted for “Department of Defense” for consistency.
