    In clause (1), the word “amend” is substituted for “alter” for consistency in the revised title. The words “not inconsistent with law” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In clause (3), the words “States, territories, and possessions” are substituted for “several States and Territories” for consistency in the revised title.

    Clause (4) is substituted for “acquire, hold, mortgage, and dispose of such real and personal property as may be necessary for its corporate purposes” and “accept gifts, legacies, and devises which will further the corporate purposes” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In clause (6), the words “any other act” are substituted for “any and all acts and things” to eliminate unnecessary words. The word “objects” is omitted as unnecessary.
