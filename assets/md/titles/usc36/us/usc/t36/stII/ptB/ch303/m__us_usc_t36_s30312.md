    The word “satisfaction” is omitted as included in “discharge”, and the word “obligations” is omitted as included in “liabilities”. The word “outstanding” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “Secretary of Veterans Affairs” are substituted for “Department of Veterans Affairs” because under 38:303 the Secretary is the head of the Department.
