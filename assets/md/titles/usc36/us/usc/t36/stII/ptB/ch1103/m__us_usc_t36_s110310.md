    The words “dissolution or final liquidation” are substituted for “final dissolution or liquidation” for consistency in the revised title. The word “satisfaction” is omitted as included in “discharge”, and the word “obligations” is omitted as included in “liabilities”. The words “outstanding” and “all Federal and State laws applicable thereto” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “This section does not allow” are substituted for “Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to permit” for consistency in the revised title.
