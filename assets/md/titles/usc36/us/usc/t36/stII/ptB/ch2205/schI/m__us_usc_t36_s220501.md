    In clause (3), the words “club, federation, union” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In clause (5), the words “one or more athletes” are substituted for “any athlete or athletes” and for “any athletic or athletes” for clarity and to correct a grammatical error.

    In clause (6), a reference to section 220522 (restating 36:391(b) and (c)) is unnecessary because section 220521 incorporates the eligibility requirements of section 220522.
