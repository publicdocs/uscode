    Subsection (a) is substituted for the source provision for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (b), the words “restriction or other” in 36:5015 are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 36:5014 (last sentence) is omitted as unnecessary because of clause (2) of the revised subsection.
