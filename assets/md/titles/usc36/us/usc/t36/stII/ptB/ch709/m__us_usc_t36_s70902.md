## § 70902. Purposes

    The purposes of the corporation are—

    (1) to create, foster, and assist subsidiary chapters composed of students and former students of vocational agriculture in public schools qualifying for Federal reimbursement under the Smith-Hughes Vocational Education Act ([20 U.S.C. 11–15][/us/usc/t20/s11–15], 16–28) and associations of those chapters in the States, territories, and possessions of the United States;

    (2) to develop character, train for useful citizenship, and foster patriotism, and thereby develop competent and aggressive rural and agricultural leadership;

    (3) to create and nurture a love of country life by encouraging members to improve the farm home and its surroundings, to develop organized rural recreational activities, and to create more interest in the intelligent choice of farming occupations;

    (4) to encourage the practice of thrift;

    (5) to procure for and distribute to State associations, local chapters, and members all official supplies and equipment of the corporation;

    (6) to publish an official magazine and other publications for the members of the corporation;

    (7)

     to strengthen the confidence of young men and women in themselves and their work, to encourage members in the development of individual farming programs, and to promote their permanent establishment in farming by—

        (A) encouraging improvement in scholarship;

        (B) providing prizes and awards to deserving students who have achieved distinction in vocational agriculture, including farm mechanics activities on a local, State, or national basis; and

        (C) assisting financially, through loans or grants, deserving students in all-day vocational agriculture classes and young farmers under 30 years of age who were former students in all-day vocational agriculture classes in becoming satisfactorily established in a farming occupation;

    (8) to cooperate with others, including State boards for vocational education, in accomplishing these purposes; and

    (9) to engage in other activities, consistent with these purposes, determined by the governing body to be for the best interests of the corporation.

    In clause (1), the reference to the Vocational Education Act of 1946 (ch. 541, [49 Stat. 1488][/us/stat/49/1488]) is omitted because that Act was repealed by [section 103 of the Act of October 16, 1968][/us/act/1968-10-16/s103] ([Public Law 90–576][/us/pl/90/576], [82 Stat. 1091][/us/stat/82/1091]). The words “States, territories, and possessions” are substituted for “several States and Territories” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In clause (7), the words “young men and women” are substituted for “farm boys and young men” to use gender-neutral terminology.
