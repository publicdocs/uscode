    In clauses (1) and (2), the term “Yoemen (f)” is used (despite the inconsistency with section 153901 of the revised title) for consistency with [section 1 of the Act of June 15, 1936][/us/act/1936-06-15/s1].

    In clause (1), the words “World War I” are substituted for “the World War” for clarity.

 __Change of Name__ 

    References to Naval Reserve, other than references to Naval Reserve regarding the United States Naval Reserve Retired List, deemed to refer to Navy Reserve, see [section 515(h) of Pub. L. 109–163][/us/pl/109/163/s515/h], set out as a note under [section 10101 of Title 10][/us/usc/t10/s10101], Armed Forces.
