    The words “the activities of the corporation are not confined to the District of Columbia but may be conducted throughout the United States” are substituted for “The corporation . . . shall have the right to conduct its activities in the said District and at any other place or places in the United States” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
