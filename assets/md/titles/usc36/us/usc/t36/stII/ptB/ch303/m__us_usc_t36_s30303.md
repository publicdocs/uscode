    In subsection (a), the word “individual” is substituted for “person” for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “served in” are substituted for “was enlisted, drafted, inducted, or commissioned in” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “from time to time” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b), the word “qualification” is omitted as included in “eligibility”. The words “All persons who are members of any class of Blinded Veterans Association, Incorporated, on August 27, 1958 shall be members of such class of the corporation” are omitted as executed.
