    The word “sole” is omitted as included in “exclusive”. The words “allow others to use” are substituted for “allow or refuse the use of”, and the words “the corporation adopts” are substituted for “as have heretofore been used by the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic”, for consistency in the revised title.
