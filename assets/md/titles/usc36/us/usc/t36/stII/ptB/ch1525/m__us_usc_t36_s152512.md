    The words “dissolution or final liquidation” are substituted \[for\] “final dissolution or liquidation” for consistency in the revised title. The word “satisfaction” is omitted as included in “discharge”, and the word “obligations” is omitted as included in “liabilities”. The word “outstanding” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “as provided by” are substituted for “in accordance with the determination of” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “all Federal and State laws applicable thereto” are omitted as unnecessary.
