    In subsection (b), the words “For the purposes of initiating the corporation, the national officers shall be elected within ten days of August 13, 1953, by the persons named in [section 431 of this title][/us/usc/t36/s431], to serve until the final session of the next following annual conference. Thereafter” are omitted as obsolete. The words “one vote to each such agency and to each such organization” are omitted because section 150703(b) of the revised title already states that each of those agencies and organizations has one vote.
