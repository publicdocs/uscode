    In clause (1), the words “not inconsistent with law” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “for the management of its property and the regulation of its affairs” are added for consistency in the revised title.

    In clause (2), subclause (A), the words “hold property” are substituted for “hold real and personal estate”, and the words “necessary to carry out the purposes of the corporation” are substituted for “so far only as may be necessary to its lawful ends”, for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. In subclause (B), the word “hold” is added for clarity. The words “other property” are substituted for “such other estate” for consistency in the revised title. The words “of the United States” are added for clarity and for consistency in the revised title.
