    In clause (2), the words “make contracts” are substituted for “enter into contracts” for consistency in the revised title. The words “agreements, or other transactions” are omitted as included in “contracts”.

    Clause (3) is substituted for “The Corporation may solicit, accept, hold, use, and dispose of donations of money, property, and services received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise” in 36:5508(a)(1) and “enter into . . . leases” in 36:5508(c) for consistency in the revised title.

    Clause (4) is substituted for “determine the character of, and necessity for, its obligations and expenditures and the manner in which they shall be incurred, allowed, and paid and may incur, allow, and pay such obligations and expenditures” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In clause (5), the words “charge fees to cover the corporation’s costs” are substituted for “impose, collect, and retain such fees as are reasonably necessary to cover the direct and indirect costs of the Corporation” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Clause (6) is substituted for “take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the authority provided in this section” for consistency in the revised title.
