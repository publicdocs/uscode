## § 153702. Purposes

The purposes of the corporation are—

    (1) to perpetuate the memory of the Grand Army of the Republic, as the National Woman’s Relief Corps is its auxiliary and was organized at its request in 1883, and of the men who saved the Union in 1861 to 1865;

    (2) to assist in every practicable way in preserving, and making available for research, documents and records pertaining to the Grand Army of the Republic and its members;

    (3) to cooperate in doing honor to all those who have served our country patriotically in any war;

    (4) to teach patriotism, the duties of citizenship, the true history of our country, and the love and honor of our flag;

    (5) to oppose every tendency or movement that would weaken loyalty to, destroy, or impair our constitutional Union; and

    (6) to inculcate and broadly sustain the American principles of representative government, equal rights, and impartial justice for all.
