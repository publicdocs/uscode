    The words “precedent”, “herein”, and “or conferred” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “with the secretary of state or other designated official” are substituted for “in the office of the Secretary or the properly designated officer”, and the words “territory, or possession of the United States” are substituted for “Territory”, for consistency in the revised title. The words “post-office” and “authorized” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “in that jurisdiction” are added for clarity.
