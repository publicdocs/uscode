    The word “sole” is omitted as included in “exclusive”. The words “or refuse” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “This section does not affect any vested rights” are substituted for “No powers or privileges hereby granted shall, however, interfere or conflict with established or vested rights” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
