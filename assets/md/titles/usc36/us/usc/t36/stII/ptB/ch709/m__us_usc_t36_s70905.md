In subsection (c), the words “Secretary of Education” and “Department of Education” are substituted for “Chief of the Agricultural Education Service, Office of Education, Federal Security Agency” and “that service”, respectively, in [section 7(c) of the Act of August 30, 1950][/us/act/1950-08-30/s7/c] (ch. 823, [64 Stat. 565][/us/stat/64/565]), because of sections 5 and 8 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 (5 App. U.S.C.) and 20:3441 and 3507. In clause (3), the reference to the Vocational Education Act of 1946 (ch. 541, [49 Stat. 1488][/us/stat/49/1488]) is omitted because that Act was repealed by [section 103 of the Act of October 16, 1968][/us/act/1968-10-16/s103] ([Public Law 90–576][/us/pl/90/576], [82 Stat. 1091][/us/stat/82/1091]).
