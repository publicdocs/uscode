    In subsection (a), the words “a nonprofit corporation incorporated in New York” are substituted for “organized and incorporated as a nonprofit entity under the laws of the State of New York”, and the words “is a federally chartered corporation” are substituted for “is hereby recognized as such and is granted a Federal charter”, for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the text of 36:2714 (last sentence) is omitted as included in 36:2715. The words “restrictions or” are omitted as unnecessary.
