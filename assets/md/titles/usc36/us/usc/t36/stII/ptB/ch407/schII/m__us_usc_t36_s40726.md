In this section, the provisions for a junior competitor to be paid a subsistence allowance and a travel allowance prescribed by “the Secretary of the Army” are retained notwithstanding section 1612(d) of The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 ([Public Law 104–106][/us/pl/104/106], [110 Stat. 517][/us/stat/110/517]) which transferred the Civilian Marksmanship Program, including the National Matches, from the Secretary of the Army to the corporation. The conforming amendments in section 1624 of the Act ([110 Stat. 522][/us/stat/110/522]) did not repeal the authority of the Secretary of the Army to prescribe National Matches under 10:4312 or to prescribe subsistence and travel allowances for competitors under 10:4313.
