    In clause (1), the words “not inconsistent with law” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In clause (2), the word “property” is substituted for “real and personal estate”, and the word “necessary” is substituted for “so far only as may be necessary”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “to carry out the purposes of the corporation” are substituted for “to its lawful ends” for consistency in the revised title.
