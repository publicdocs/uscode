    Before clause (1), the word “objects” is omitted as included in “purposes”.

    Clause (1) is substituted for 36:573(1) to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In clause (2), the words “and if the corporation so decides, all or” and “or any of them” are omitted as unnecessary. In subclause (D), the words “in jurisprudence” are substituted for “therein” for clarity.

    In clause (3), the words “any other acts” are substituted for “any and all things” for consistency in the revised title.
