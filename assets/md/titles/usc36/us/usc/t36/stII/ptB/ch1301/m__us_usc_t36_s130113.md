    The word “satisfaction” is omitted as included in “discharge”, and the word “obligations” is omitted as included in “liabilities”. The word “outstanding” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “as provided by” are substituted for “in accordance with the determination of” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to the “council of administration” is retained although there is no council of administration created by 36:78e or 36:78f. The words “all Federal and State laws applicable thereto” are omitted as unnecessary.
