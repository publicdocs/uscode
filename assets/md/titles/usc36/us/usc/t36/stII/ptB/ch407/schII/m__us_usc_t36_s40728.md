    In subsection (a), the words “director of civilian marksmanship (as that position existed under [section 4307 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s4307] on February 9, 1996)” are substituted for “Director of the Civilian Marksmanship Program” to avoid confusion with the office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship created on February 10, 1996, by section 1611(d) of The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 ([Public Law 104–106][/us/pl/104/106], [110 Stat. 516][/us/stat/110/516]).
