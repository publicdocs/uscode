    The words “sole” and “to have and to use in carrying out its purposes” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “required to carry out the duties and powers of the corporation” are substituted for “as may be required in the furtherance of its functions” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The last sentence is substituted for “No powers or privileges hereby granted shall, however, interfere or conflict with established or vested rights” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
