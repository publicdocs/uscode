    The word “activities” is substituted for “proceedings” for consistency in the revised title. The words “any part of the report the Secretary decides is appropriate” are substituted for “whole of such reports, or such portion thereof as he shall see fit” to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __Termination of Reporting Requirements__ 

    For termination, effective May 15, 2000, of provisions of law requiring submittal to Congress of any annual, semiannual, or other regular periodic report listed in House Document No. 103–7 (in which a report required under this section is listed on page 192), see [section 3003 of Pub. L. 104–66][/us/pl/104/66/s3003], as amended, set out as a note under [section 1113 of Title 31][/us/usc/t31/s1113], Money and Finance.
