    In this section, the text of 36:228 is omitted as executed and obsolete.

    In clause (1), the words “not inconsistent with the laws of the United States or of any State” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Clause (4) is substituted for “acquire, hold, lease, and dispose of such real and personal property as may be necessary to carry out the corporate object and purpose” and “accept gifts, legacies, and devises in furtherance of the corporate object and purpose” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In clause (8), the words “and all . . . and things” and “object” are omitted as unnecessary.
