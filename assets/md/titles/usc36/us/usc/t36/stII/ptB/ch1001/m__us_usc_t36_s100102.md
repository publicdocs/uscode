    In subsection (a), the words “organized and” and “the Nonprofit Corporation Acts of the States of” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “is a federally chartered corporation” are substituted for “is hereby recognized as such and is granted a charter” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the text of 36:1714 (last sentence) is omitted as included in 36:1715. The words “restrictions or” are omitted as unnecessary.
