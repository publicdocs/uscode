    The words “may acquire, own, lease, encumber, and transfer” are substituted for “is authorized to take by purchase, gift, grant, devise, and bequest, and to hold, mortgage, lease, transfer, and convey” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “real and personal” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “to carry out the purpose of the corporation” are substituted for “for the purposes of the said corporation” and “as may be deemed necessary for the wants or development of the corporation or any of them” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
