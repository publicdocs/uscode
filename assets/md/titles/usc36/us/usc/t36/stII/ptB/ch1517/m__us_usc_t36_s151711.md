 __References in Text__ 

    The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, referred to in subsec. (b), is classified generally to Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.

 __Amendments__ 

    2008—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 110–336][/us/pl/110/336], which directed that subsec. (a) be “amended to read as follows: by inserting after the first sentence the following:” and then set out subsec. (a) designation and heading and pars. (1) and (2), was executed by substituting the new subsec. (a) designation, heading, and pars. for the existing subsec. (a) to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “There are authorized to be appropriated to the Library of Congress amounts necessary to carry out this chapter, not to exceed $530,000 for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009. These amounts are to be made available to the corporation to match any private contributions (whether in currency, services, or property) made to the corporation by private persons and State and local governments.”

    2005—[Pub. L. 109–9][/us/pl/109/9] added subsecs. (a) and (b) and struck out former subsecs. (a) and (b) which read as follows:

    “(a) Authorization.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the Library of Congress amounts necessary to carry out this chapter, not to exceed $250,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 2000–2005. These amounts are to be made available to the corporation to match private contributions (whether in currency, services, or property) made to the corporation by private persons and State and local governments.

    “(b) Limitation Related to Administrative Expenses.—Amounts authorized under this section may not be used by the corporation for administrative expenses of the corporation, including salaries, travel, transportation, and overhead expenses.”

    2004—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447] substituted “2005” for “2003”.
