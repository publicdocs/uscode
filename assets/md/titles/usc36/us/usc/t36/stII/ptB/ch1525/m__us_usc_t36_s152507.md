    In subsection (a), the words “any shares of” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b), the word “public” is added for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (c), the words “inure to the benefit of” are substituted for “inure to” for consistency in the revised title. The words “as provided in [section 476 of this title][/us/usc/t36/s476]” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “This subsection does not prevent” are substituted for “Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “board of directors” are substituted for “executive committee” because the source provisions for this chapter do not mention an executive committee and, under [section 152504 of this title][/us/usc/t36/s152504], the governing body of the corporation is the board of directors.
