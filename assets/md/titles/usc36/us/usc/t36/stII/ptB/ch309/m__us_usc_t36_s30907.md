    In subsection (a), the words “The corporation shall hold an annual meeting” are substituted for “An annual meeting of the incorporators, their associates and successors, shall be held once in every year after the year of incorporation” to eliminate unnecessary and executed words.

    In subsection (d), the word “records” is substituted for “books, documents, and papers” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
