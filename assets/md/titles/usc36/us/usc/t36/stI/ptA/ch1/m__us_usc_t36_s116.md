    In subsection (a), the designation is added, and the words “last Monday in May” are substituted for “May 30” in the Act of May 11, 1950 (ch. 182, [64 Stat. 158][/us/stat/64/158]), because of [section 1(b) of the Act of June 28, 1968][/us/act/1968-06-28/s1/b] ([Public Law 90–363][/us/pl/90/363], [82 Stat. 250][/us/stat/82/250]).

    In subsection (b)(4), the word “media” is substituted for “newspapers, radio stations, and all other mediums of information” to eliminate unnecessary words.
