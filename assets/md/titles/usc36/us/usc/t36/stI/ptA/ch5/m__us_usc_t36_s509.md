    The words “by the Council of the District of Columbia” and “the authority of” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “under title 18” are substituted for “not more than $100” for consistency with title 18. The words “A separate violation occurs under this section for each day the violation continues” are substituted for 36:728 (last sentence) for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.
