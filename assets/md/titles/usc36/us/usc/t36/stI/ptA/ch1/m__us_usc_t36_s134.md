## § 134. Pan American Aviation Day

The President may issue each year a proclamation—

    (1) designating December 17 as Pan American Aviation Day; and

    (2) calling on all officials of the United States Government, the chief executive offices of the States, territories, and possessions of the United States, and all citizens to participate in the observance of Pan American Aviation Day to further, and stimulate interest in, aviation in the American countries as an important stimulus to the further development of more rapid communications and a cultural development between the countries of the Western Hemisphere.

    In clause (2), the words “chief executive officers of the States, territories, and possessions of the United States” are substituted for “Governors of the fifty States, our possessions”, and the word “countries” is substituted for “nations”, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
