    In this chapter, the word “Mayor” is substituted for “Commissioners” in the Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies Act (ch. 974, [70 Stat. 1049][/us/stat/70/1049]) \[subsequently changed to “Commissioner” in 36:ch. 30 because section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (5 App. U.S.C.) transferred the functions of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia and because of 36:730\] because of sections 421 and 711 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act ([Public Law 93–198][/us/pl/93/198], [87 Stat. 789][/us/stat/87/789], 818), which abolished the office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia and replaced it with the office of Mayor of the District of Columbia.

    In this section, the text of 36:721(b)(3)–(5) is omitted because the complete names of the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Secretaries of Defense and of the Interior are used the first time the terms appear in a section.
