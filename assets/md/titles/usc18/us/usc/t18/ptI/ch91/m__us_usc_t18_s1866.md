    In subsection (a), the provision is transferred to title 18 to make clear that it is a criminal penalty. The words “fined under this title” are substituted for “punished by a fine of not more than $500” for consistency with chapter 227.

    In subsection (b), the words “fined under this title” are substituted for “fined in a sum of not more than $500” for consistency with chapter 227.
