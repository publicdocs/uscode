 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 97 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 45, [35 Stat. 1097][/us/stat/35/1097]; [Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 73][/us/act/1940-03-28/ch73], [54 Stat. 80][/us/stat/54/80]).

    Reference to territory, Canal Zone, Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands was omitted as covered by definition of United States in [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5].

    Words “naval or Coast Guard” were inserted before “reservation” and words “yard, station, or installation” were inserted after “arsenal” in two places, so as to extend section to naval or Coast Guard property.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500” in last par.

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
