## § 1907. Disclosure of information by farm credit examiner

    Whoever, being a farm credit examiner or any examiner, public or private, discloses the names of borrowers of any Federal land bank association or Federal land bank, or any organization examined by him under the provisions of law relating to Federal intermediate credit banks, to other than the proper officers of such institution or organization, without first having obtained express permission in writing from the Land Bank Commissioner or from the board of directors of such institution or organization, except when ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction or by direction of the Congress of the United States or either House thereof, or any committee of Congress or either House duly authorized, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and shall be disqualified from holding office as a farm credit examiner.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 791][/us/stat/62/791]; [Pub. L. 86–168, title I][/us/pl/86/168/tI], § 104(h), Aug. 18, 1959, [73 Stat. 387][/us/stat/73/387]; [Pub. L. 97–297][/us/pl/97/297], § 4(c), Oct. 12, 1982, [96 Stat. 1318][/us/stat/96/1318]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on sections 983 and 1124 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ([July 17, 1916, ch. 245][/us/act/1916-07-17/ch245], § 31 \[third and fourth sentences of third paragraph\], [39 Stat. 383][/us/stat/39/383]; [July 17, 1916, ch. 245][/us/act/1916-07-17/ch245], § 211(d) \[part of first sentence\], as added [Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252][/us/act/1923-03-04/ch252], § 2, [42 Stat. 1460][/us/stat/42/1460]; [June 16, 1933, ch. 98][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch98], § 80(a), [48 Stat. 273][/us/stat/48/273]).

    [Section 983 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s983], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, does not include the term “farm credit examiner,” as used in this section, but it relates thereto as is indicated by sections 951 and 952 of said title.

    [Section 1124 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1124], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, which was taken from a chapter in that title dealing with Federal intermediate credit banks, also relates to farm credit examiners as is indicated by section 1093 thereof. Even so, it was deemed advisable to retain the reference to any examiner “public or private,” as used in said section 1124.

    For clarification, the types of associations, banks, and organizations to which section relates, were enumerated wherever referred to, and words “examined by him under the provisions of law relating to Federal intermediate credit banks” were inserted.

    In addition, changes were made in phraseology.

    The provisions relating to disqualification from holding office as an incident to violation were contained in [section 1124 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1124], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.

    For bribery and other provisions of [section 1124 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1124], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, see sections 218 and 1909 of this title.

    Other provisions of said [section 983 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s983], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incorporated in [section 221 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s221].

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.

    1982—[Pub. L. 97–297][/us/pl/97/297] substituted “or Federal land bank” for “, Federal land bank, or joint-stock land bank”.

    1959—[Pub. L. 86–168][/us/pl/86/168] substituted “Federal land bank associations” for “national farm loan association”.

 __Effective Date of 1959 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 86–168][/us/pl/86/168] effective Dec. 31, 1959, see [section 104(k) of Pub. L. 86–168][/us/pl/86/168/s104/k].

 __Abolition of Office of Land Bank Commissioner__ 

    The office of Land Bank Commissioner was abolished by [section 636f of Title 12][/us/usc/t12/s636f], Banks and Banking.
