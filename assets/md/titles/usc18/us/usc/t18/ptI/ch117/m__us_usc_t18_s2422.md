([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 812][/us/stat/62/812]; [Pub. L. 99–628][/us/pl/99/628], § 5(b)(1), Nov. 7, 1986, [100 Stat. 3511][/us/stat/100/3511]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 399 ([June 25, 1910, ch. 395][/us/act/1910-06-25/ch395], § 3, [36 Stat. 825][/us/stat/36/825]).

    Words “deemed guilty of a felony” were deleted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    Words “and on conviction thereof shall be” were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    The references to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “Possession of the United States” were inserted twice. (See reviser’s note under [section 2421 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2421].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–248][/us/pl/109/248] substituted “not less than 10 years or for life” for “not less than 5 years and not more than 30 years”.

    1998—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 105–314][/us/pl/105/314], § 102(1), inserted “or attempts to do so,” before “shall be fined” and substituted “10 years” for “five years”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 105–314][/us/pl/105/314], § 102(2), added subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: “Whoever, using any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, including the mail, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or any sexual act for which any person may be criminally prosecuted, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”
