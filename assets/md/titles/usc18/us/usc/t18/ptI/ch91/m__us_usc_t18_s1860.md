## § 1860. Bids at land sales

    Whoever bargains, contracts, or agrees, or attempts to bargain, contract, or agree with another that such other shall not bid upon or purchase any parcel of lands of the United States offered at public sale; or

    Whoever, by intimidation, combination, or unfair management, hinders, prevents, or attempts to hinder or prevent, any person from bidding upon or purchasing any tract of land so offered for sale—

    Shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 789][/us/stat/62/789].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 113 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 59, [35 Stat. 1099][/us/stat/35/1099]).

    Imprisonment provision was reduced from “two years” to “one year,” thus placing the offense in the category of misdemeanors which may be prosecuted on information. The lesser punishment seems adequate.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
