 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1514(f) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1514/f], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture; sections 264w, 598, 1138d(e), 1441(e), 1467(d) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking; [section 616(e) of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s616/e], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade; title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 206 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 116, [35 Stat. 1109][/us/stat/35/1109]; [Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6], § 22(j), as added [June 19, 1934, ch. 653][/us/act/1934-06-19/ch653], § 3, [48 Stat. 1107][/us/stat/48/1107]; [Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8][/us/act/1932-01-22/ch8], § 16(e), [47 Stat. 12][/us/stat/47/12]; [July 22, 1932, ch. 522][/us/act/1932-07-22/ch522], § 21, [47 Stat. 738][/us/stat/47/738]; [June 13, 1933, ch. 64][/us/act/1933-06-13/ch64], § 8, [48 Stat. 135][/us/stat/48/135]; [June 16, 1933, ch. 98][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch98], § 64, [48 Stat. 268][/us/stat/48/268], 269; [Jan. 25, 1934, ch. 5][/us/act/1934-01-25/ch5], [48 Stat. 337][/us/stat/48/337]; [Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7][/us/act/1934-01-31/ch7], § 13, [48 Stat. 347][/us/stat/48/347]; [June 27, 1934, ch. 847][/us/act/1934-06-27/ch847], title V, § 510, [58 Stat. 1264][/us/stat/58/1264]; [May 28, 1935, ch. 150][/us/act/1935-05-28/ch150], §§ 20, 21, [49 Stat. 298][/us/stat/49/298]; [Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614][/us/act/1935-08-23/ch614], § 101, [49 Stat. 703][/us/stat/49/703]; [Aug. 26, 1937, ch. 821][/us/act/1937-08-26/ch821], [50 Stat. 838][/us/stat/50/838]; [Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30][/us/act/1938-02-16/ch30], title V, § 514, [52 Stat. 77][/us/stat/52/77]).

    These sections were consolidated with such changes of phraseology as were necessary to effect consolidation. Said [section 206 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s206], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was the principal source of this section, but the enumeration of the kinds of commitments exempted was drawn from the various sections of said title 12 set forth above. The reference to crop insurance agreements is drawn from [section 1514(f) of Title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1514/f], Agriculture.

    The applicability provisions of the sections here consolidated were unclear and of doubtful value. As revised the section preserves everything of value without change of substance.

    References to the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act and the Farmers’ Home Administrative Act of 1946 were included in this revised section notwithstanding the omission (and consequent repeal) of former subsection (d) of section 52 of the said Bankhead-Jones Act (1937) (Title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 1026) in the amendment of said section 52 of such Act by section 3 of the said Farmers’ Home Administration Act of 1946 ([August 14, 1946, ch. 964][/us/act/1946-08-14/ch964], [60 Stat. 1062][/us/stat/60/1062]). The essential nature of the transactions under the several acts would render inconsistent any attempt to include some and exclude others.
