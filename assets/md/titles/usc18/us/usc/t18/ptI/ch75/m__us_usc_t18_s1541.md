 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 219 of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s219], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (R.S. 4078; [June 14, 1902, ch. 1088][/us/act/1902-06-14/ch1088], § 3, [32 Stat. 386][/us/stat/32/386]).

    The venue provision, which followed the punishment provisions, was omitted as covered by [section 3238 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3238].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—[Pub. L. 107–273][/us/pl/107/273] substituted “to facilitate” for “to facility” in third par.

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294], § 607(n)(1), struck out “or possession” after “or a State” in first par.

    [Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294], § 607(n)(2), added last par. defining “State” for purposes of this section.

    [Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208] substituted “imprisoned not more than 25 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism (as defined in [section 2331 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2331])), 20 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [section 929(a) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s929/a])), 10 years (in the case of the first or second such offense, if the offense was not committed to facility such an act of international terrorism or a drug trafficking crime), or 15 years (in the case of any other offense)” for “imprisoned not more than 10 years” in third par.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 330016(1)(G), which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “under this title” for “not more than $500”, could not be executed because the words “not more than $500” did not appear in text subsequent to amendment by [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 130009(a)(1). See below.

    [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 130009(a)(1), substituted “under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years” for “not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than one year” in last par.

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208] applicable with respect to offenses occurring on or after Sept. 30, 1996, see [section 211(c) of Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208/s211/c], set out as a note under [section 1028 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1028].
