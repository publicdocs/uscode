## § 1731. Vehicles falsely labeled as carriers

    It shall be unlawful to paint, print, or in any manner to place upon or attach to any steamboat or other vessel, or any car, stagecoach, vehicle, or other conveyance, not actually used in carrying the mail, the words “United States Mail”, or any words, letters, or characters of like import; or to give notice, by publishing in any newspaper or otherwise, that any steamboat or other vessel, or any car, stagecoach, vehicle, or other conveyance, is used in carrying the mail, when the same is not actually so used.

    Whoever violates, and every owner, receiver, lessee, or managing operator who suffers, or permits the violation of, any provision of this section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 785][/us/stat/62/785]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(G)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/G], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 311 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 188][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s188], [35 Stat. 1124][/us/stat/35/1124]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    The punishment provision was rewritten to conform more closely with comparable offenses in other sections. (See sections 1729 and 1730 of this title.)

    Minor verbal changes were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500” in second par.
