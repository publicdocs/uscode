 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 253 ([May 18, 1934, ch. 299, § 1][/us/act/1934-05-18/ch299/s1], [48 Stat. 780][/us/stat/48/780]; [Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40][/us/act/1936-02-08/ch40], [49 Stat. 1105][/us/stat/49/1105]; [June 26, 1936, ch. 830][/us/act/1936-06-26/ch830], title I, § 3, [49 Stat. 1940][/us/stat/49/1940]; Reorg. Plan No. II, § 4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, [53 Stat. 1433][/us/stat/53/1433]; [June 13, 1940, ch. 359][/us/act/1940-06-13/ch359], [54 Stat. 391][/us/stat/54/391]).

    The section was extended to include United States judges, attorneys and their assistants, and officers of Federal, penal and correctional institutions in view of the obvious desirability of such protective legislation.

    Employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry have been included in this section to complete the revision of [section 118 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s118], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was consolidated with the assault provisions of section 254 of said title 18 and is now [section 111 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s111]. There seemed no sound reason for including such officers in the protection against assaults but excluding them from the homicide sections.

    For like reasons the section was broadened to include officers or employees of the Secret Service or of the Bureau of Narcotics.

    Changes in phraseology were made.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section \[section 24\] amends [section 1114 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1114], U.S.C., to conform more closely with the original statute from which it was derived.
