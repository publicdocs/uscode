## § 1917. Interference with civil service examinations

    Whoever, being a member or employee of the United States Office of Personnel Management or an individual in the public service, willfully and corruptly—

    (2) falsely marks, grades, estimates, or reports on the examination or proper standing of an individual examined;

    (4) furnishes to an individual any special or secret information for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects or chances of an individual examined, or to be examined, being appointed, employed, or promoted;

    shall, for each offense, be fined under this title not less than $100 or imprisoned not less than ten days nor more than one year, or both.

(Added [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], § 3(d), Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 609][/us/stat/80/609]; amended [Pub.

    The section is rewritten to conform to the style of title 18. The words “a member or employee of the United States Civil Service Commission” are coextensive with and substituted for “Civil Service Commissioner, examiner, copyist, or messenger”.

    The references to actions in concert with others to violate this section are omitted in view of the crime of conspiracy contained in chapter 19 of title 18.

    In paragraph (1), the words “the rules prescribed by the President under title 5 for the administration of the competitive service and the regulations prescribed by the Commission under [section 1302(a) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s1302/a]” are substituted for “any such rules or regulations” to provide the basis of reference.

    The words “be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [18 U.S.C. 212][/us/usc/t18/s212], 1964 ed.)

    The words “and upon conviction thereof” are omitted as unnecessary because punishment can be imposed only after conviction.

    The words “or both” are substituted for “or by both such fine and imprisonment”.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “fined under this title not less than $100” for “fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000” in concluding provisions.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “Office of Personnel Management” for “Civil Service Commission” in introductory provisions and “such Office” for “the Commission” in par. (1).
