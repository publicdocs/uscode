([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 751][/us/stat/62/751]; [Pub. L. 90–19, § 24(c)][/us/pl/90/19/s24/c], May 25, 1967, [81 Stat. 28][/us/stat/81/28]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1731(a) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1731/a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ([June 27, 1934, ch. 847, § 512(a)][/us/act/1934-06-27/ch847/s512/a], [48 Stat. 1265][/us/stat/48/1265]; [Feb. 3, 1938, ch. 13, § 9][/us/act/1938-02-03/ch13/s9], [52 Stat. 24][/us/stat/52/24]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    “$5,000” was substituted for “$3,000” to make this section more consistent in its punishment provisions with comparable sections. (See [section 1008 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1008].)

    Minor changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.

    1967—[Pub. L. 90–19][/us/pl/90/19] included reference to Department of Housing and Urban Development in section catchline and substituted in text “Department of Housing and Urban Development” for “Federal Housing Administration” and “Department” for “Administration” in two places, respectively.
