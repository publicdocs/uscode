## § 965. Verified statements as prerequisite to vessel’s departure

    (a) During a war in which the United States is a neutral nation, every master or person having charge or command of any vessel, domestic or foreign, whether requiring clearance or not, before departure of such vessel from port shall, in addition to the facts required by section 431 of the Tariff Act of 1930 ([19 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t19/s1431]) and [section 60105 of title 46][/us/usc/t46/s60105], to be set out in the masters’ and shippers’ manifests before clearance will be issued to vessels bound to foreign ports, deliver to the Customs Service a statement, duly verified by oath, that the cargo or any part of the cargo is or is not to be delivered to other vessels in port or to be transshipped on the high seas, and, if it is to be so delivered or transshipped, stating the kind and quantities and the value of the total quantity of each kind of article so to be delivered or transshipped, and the name of the person, corporation, vessel, or government to whom the delivery or transshipment is to be made; and the owners, shippers, or consignors of the cargo of such vessel shall in the same manner and under the same conditions deliver to the Customs Service like statements under oath as to the cargo or the parts thereof laden or shipped by them, respectively.

    (b) Whoever, in violation of this section, takes or attempts to take, or authorizes the taking of any such vessel, out of port or from the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.    In addition, such vessel, her tackle, apparel, furniture, equipment, and her cargo shall be forfeited to the United States.

        The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to promulgate regulations upon compliance with which vessels engaged in the coastwise trade or fisheries or used solely for pleasure may be relieved from complying with this section.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 747][/us/stat/62/747]; [Pub. L. 103–182, title VI, § 687][/us/pl/103/182/s687], Dec. 8, 1993, [107 Stat. 2221][/us/stat/107/2221]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/L], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 109–304, § 17(d)(5)][/us/pl/109/304/s17/d/5], Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1707][/us/stat/120/1707].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 34, 36 ([June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title V, §§ 4, 6, [40 Stat. 222][/us/stat/40/222]; [Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72, § 5][/us/act/1940-03-28/ch72/s5], [54 Stat. 79][/us/stat/54/79]).

    Section consolidates said sections of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Words “within the United States” were substituted for “within the jurisdiction” etc., in view of the definition of United States in [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5].

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Words in subsection (a), referring to title 46, sections 91, 92, and 94, “each of which sections is hereby declared to be and is continued in full force and effect,” were omitted as surplusage.

    The conspiracy provision of said section 36 was omitted as covered by [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s371]. See reviser’s note under that section.

    The final paragraph of the revised section was added on advice of the Treasury Department, to conform with administrative practice and because of the unnecessary burden upon domestic commerce had the provisions of this section been enforced against coastwise, fishing, and pleasure vessels.

    Minor changes of phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304] substituted “[section 60105 of title 46][/us/usc/t46/s60105]” for “section 4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (46 U.S.C. App. 91)”.

    1994—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.

    1993—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 103–182][/us/pl/103/182] substituted “section 431 of the Tariff Act of 1930 ([19 U.S.C. 1431][/us/usc/t19/s1431]) and section 4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (46 U.S.C. App. 91),” for “sections 91, 92, and 94 of Title 46”, “deliver to the Customs Service” for “deliver to the collector of customs for the district wherein such vessel is then located”, and “the Customs Service like” for “the collector like”.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the United States Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury, including functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto, to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 203(1), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].
