As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of sections 5 and 7 of this title and [section 46501(2) of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s46501/2].

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 255 of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s255], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (R.S. § 4062).

    Punishment provision was rewritten to make it more definite by substituting a maximum of $5,000 in lieu of the words “fined at the discretion of the court.” As thus revised this provision conforms with the first punishment provision of [section 111 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s111]. So, also, the greater punishment provided by the second paragraph of section 111 was added to this section for offenses involving the use of dangerous weapons.
