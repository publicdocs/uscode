([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 759][/us/stat/62/759]; [Pub. L. 101–644, title I, § 104(a)][/us/pl/101/644/s104/a], Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4663][/us/stat/104/4663]; [Pub. L. 111–211, title I, § 103][/us/pl/111/211/s103], July 29, 2010, [124 Stat. 2260][/us/stat/124/2260].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 305e of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s305e], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ([Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, § 6][/us/act/1935-08-27/ch748/s6], [49 Stat. 893][/us/stat/49/893]).

    The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of misdemeanor in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1].

    The last paragraph of [section 305e of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s305e], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to duty of district attorney to prosecute violations of such section, will be incorporated in title 28, U.S. Code.

    Maximum fine of $2,000 was changed to $500 to bring the offense within the category of petty offenses defined by [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [section 1157 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1157].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2010—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 111–211, § 103(1)][/us/pl/111/211/s103/1], added subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: “Whoever knowingly violates subsection (a) shall—

    “(1) in the case of a first violation, if an individual, be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000; and

    “(2) in the case of subsequent violations, if an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $5,000,000.”

    Subsec. (c)(3). [Pub. L. 111–211, § 103(2)][/us/pl/111/211/s103/2], added par. (3) and struck out former par. (3) which read as follows: “the term ‘Indian tribe’ means—

    “(A) any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or other organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or

    “(B) any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority; and”.

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–644][/us/pl/101/644] substituted “Misrepresentation of Indian produced goods and products” for “Misrepresentation in sale of products” in section catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “Whoever willfully offers or displays for sale any goods, with or without any Government trade mark, as Indian products or Indian products of a particular Indian tribe or group, resident within the United States or the Territory of Alaska, when such person knows such goods are not Indian products or are not Indian products of the particular Indian tribe or group, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.”

 __Certification of Indian Artisans__ 

    For purposes of this section, an Indian tribe may not impose fee to certify individual as Indian artisan, with “Indian tribe” having same meaning as in subsec. (c)(3) of this section, see [section 107 of Pub. L. 101–644][/us/pl/101/644/s107], set out as a note under [section 305e of Title 25][/us/usc/t25/s305e], Indians.

 __Admission of Alaska as State__ 

    Admission of Alaska into the Union was accomplished Jan. 3, 1959, on issuance of Proc. No. 3269, Jan. 3, 1959 24 F.R. 81, 73 Stat. c16, as required by sections 1 and 8(c) of [Pub. L. 85–508][/us/pl/85/508], July 7, 1958, [72 Stat. 339][/us/stat/72/339], set out as notes preceding [section 21 of Title 48][/us/usc/t48/s21], Territories and Insular Possessions.
