## § 914. Creditors of the United States

    Whoever falsely personates any true and lawful holder of any share or sum in the public stocks or debt of the United States, or any person entitled to any annuity, dividend, pension, wages, or other debt due from the United States, and, under color of such false personation, transfers or endeavors to transfer such public stock or any part thereof, or receives or endeavors to receive the money of such true and lawful holder thereof, or the money of any person really entitled to receive such annuity, dividend, pension, wages, or other debt, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 742][/us/stat/62/742]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 78 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 33][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s33], [35 Stat. 1095][/us/stat/35/1095]).

    Words “prize money” after “pension” were deleted as repealed by [act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 413][/us/act/1899-03-03/ch413], [30 Stat. 1007][/us/stat/30/1007], repealing all laws authorizing prize money distribution.

    Mandatory punishment was rephrased in the alternative.

    In the punishment provision the words “five years” were substituted for “ten years” to harmonize it with the punishment provisions in sections 287 and 1001 of this title, covering similar offenses. (See reviser’s note under [section 287 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s287].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
