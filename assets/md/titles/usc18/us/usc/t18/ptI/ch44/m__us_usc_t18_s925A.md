## § 925A. Remedy for erroneous denial of firearm

    Any person denied a firearm pursuant to subsection (s) or (t) of section 922—

    (2) who was not prohibited from receipt of a firearm pursuant to subsection (g) or (n) of section 922,

    may bring an action against the State or political subdivision responsible for providing the erroneous information, or responsible for denying the transfer, or against the United States, as the case may be, for an order directing that the erroneous information be corrected or that the transfer be approved, as the case may be.
