## § 2390. Enlistment to serve against United States

    Whoever enlists or is engaged within the United States or in any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, with intent to serve in armed hostility against the United States, shall be fined under this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 812][/us/stat/62/812]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(B), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 8 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 8, [35 Stat. 1089][/us/stat/35/1089]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by striking “fined not more than $100” and inserting “fined under this title”, was executed by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined $100”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
