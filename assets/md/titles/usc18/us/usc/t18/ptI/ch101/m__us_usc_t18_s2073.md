([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 795][/us/stat/62/795]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 189 ([Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 270][/us/act/1911-03-04/ch270], [36 Stat. 1355][/us/stat/36/1355]).

    Words “or any of its agencies” were inserted after “United States” so as to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    References to persons aiding and abetting were omitted. Such persons are principals under [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Minor verbal changes were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.
