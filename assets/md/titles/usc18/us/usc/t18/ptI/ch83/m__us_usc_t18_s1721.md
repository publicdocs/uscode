([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 783][/us/stat/62/783]; [Aug. 1, 1956, ch. 818][/us/act/1956-08-01/ch818], [70 Stat. 784][/us/stat/70/784]; [Pub. L. 91–375, § 6(j)(29)][/us/pl/91/375/s6/j/29], Aug. 12, 1970, [84 Stat. 780][/us/stat/84/780]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 331 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s331] and [section 364 of title 39][/us/usc/t39/s364], The Postal Service, both U.S.C., 1940 ed. (R.S. § 3920; [Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 208][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s208], [35 Stat. 1128][/us/stat/35/1128]).

    Said sections were consolidated with only minor changes in phraseology.

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500”.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] substituted “Postal Service officer or employee” for “postmaster or postal service employee”, “Postal Service” for “Post Office Department” in two places, “officer or employee” for “postmaster or other person”, and “any such officer or employee” for “the postmaster or any employee of a post office or station or branch thereof”, respectively.

    1956—Act Aug. 1, 1956, broadened the class of postal employees subject to penalties prescribed by this section and broadened the prohibition to include the inflation of receipts by means other than the disposing of stamps, stamped envelopes, or postal cards.

 __Effective Date of 1970 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by Board of Governors of United States Postal Service and published by it in Federal Register, see [section 15(a) of Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375/s15/a], set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s101], Postal Service.
