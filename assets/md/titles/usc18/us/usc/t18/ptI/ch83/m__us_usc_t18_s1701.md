## § 1701. Obstruction of mails generally

    Whoever knowingly and willfully obstructs or retards the passage of the mail, or any carrier or conveyance carrying the mail, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 778][/us/stat/62/778]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(B), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 324, 325 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], §§ 201, 202, [35 Stat. 1127][/us/stat/35/1127]).

    Sections 324 and 325 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.

    Words “carriage, horse, driver or”, “car, steamboat”, and “or vessel” were omitted as covered by “any carrier or conveyance”.

    The punishment provision is derived from said section 324 rather than from section 325 which provided only a fine of not more than $100 and related only to ferrymen.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $100”.
