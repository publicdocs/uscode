([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 721][/us/stat/62/721]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/H], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, § 601(a)(12)][/us/pl/104/294/s601/a/12], Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3498][/us/stat/110/3498].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on sections 250, 252, of title 2, U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Congress ([Feb. 28, 1925, ch. 368][/us/act/1925-02-28/ch368], title III, §§ 311, 314, [43 Stat. 1073][/us/stat/43/1073], 1074).

    This section consolidates the provisions of sections 250 and 252 of title 2, U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Congress.

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    The punishment provisions of [section 252 of title 2][/us/usc/t2/s252], U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Congress, were incorporated at end of section upon authority of reference in such section making them applicable to this section.

    Words “or both” were added to conform to the almost universal formula of the punishment provisions of this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “shall be fined under this title” for “shall be fined not more than $10,000” in last par.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “shall be fined under this title” for “shall be fined not more than $1,000” in last par.
