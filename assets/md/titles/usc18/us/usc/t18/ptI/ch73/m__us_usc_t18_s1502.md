    Said [section 661 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s661], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was incorporated in this section and [section 752 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s752].

    Words “an extradition agent of the United States” were substituted for “such agent” which was referred to in sections 3182 et seq. of this title.

    A fine of “$300” was substituted for “$1,000” as the mandatory maximum to harmonize with similar offenses in this chapter. (See [section 1501 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1501].)

    Punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
