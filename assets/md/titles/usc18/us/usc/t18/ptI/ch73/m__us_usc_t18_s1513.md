    (a)

        (1)

         Whoever kills or attempts to kill another person with intent to retaliate against any person for—

            shall be punished as provided in paragraph (2).

        (2)

         The punishment for an offense under this subsection is—

            (A) in the case of a killing, the punishment provided in sections 1111 and 1112; and

            (B) in the case of an attempt, imprisonment for not more than 30 years.

    (b)

     Whoever knowingly engages in any conduct and thereby causes bodily injury to another person or damages the tangible property of another person, or threatens to do so, with intent to retaliate against any person for—

    (f) Whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.

    (g) A prosecution under this section may be brought in the district in which the official proceeding (whether pending, about to be instituted, or completed) was intended to be affected, or in which the conduct constituting the alleged offense occurred.
