([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 804][/us/stat/62/804]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 502 ([June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title III, § 1, [40 Stat. 221][/us/stat/40/221]).

    Words “as defined in [section 501 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s501],” were omitted in view of [section 9 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s9], defining vessel of the United States.

    Last sentence of said section 502, defining “United States”, was incorporated in [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5].

    Provision prohibiting conspiracy was deleted as adequately covered by the general conspiracy statute, [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s371].

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
