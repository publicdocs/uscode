([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 749][/us/stat/62/749]; [Pub. L. 101–647, title XXV][/us/pl/101/647/tXXV], § 2597(g), Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4910][/us/stat/104/4910]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 591 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s591], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. § 5208; [July 12, 1882, ch. 290][/us/act/1882-07-12/ch290], § 13, [22 Stat. 166][/us/stat/22/166]; [Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177][/us/act/1918-09-26/ch177], § 7, [40 Stat. 972][/us/stat/40/972]; [Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191][/us/act/1927-02-25/ch191], § 12, [44 Stat. 1231][/us/stat/44/1231]).

    Words “be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall” were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1].

    Words “on conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.

    Words “in any district court of the United States” were omitted as unnecessary, because [section 3231 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3231] confers jurisdiction on Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 3(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, referred to in text, is classified to [section 1813(h) of Title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1813/h], Banks and Banking.

    Section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978, referred to in text, is classified to [section 3101 of Title 12][/us/usc/t12/s3101].

    Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, referred to in text, is classified to subchapter I (§ 601 et seq.) of chapter 6 of Title 12. Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, which is classified to subchapter II (§ 611 et seq.) of chapter 6 of Title 12, was renumbered section 25A of that act by [Pub. L. 102–242, title I][/us/pl/102/242/tI], § 142(e)(2), Dec. 19, 1991, [105 Stat. 2281][/us/stat/105/2281].

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647] substituted a comma for “or” after “Federal Reserve bank” and inserted “insured bank (as defined in section 3(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act,” after “Federal Reserve System,” and “, branch, agency, or organization,” after “has been regularly deposited in the bank”.
