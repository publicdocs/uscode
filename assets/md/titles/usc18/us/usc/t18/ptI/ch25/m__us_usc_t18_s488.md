## § 488. Making or possessing counterfeit dies for foreign coins

    Whoever, within the United States, without lawful authority, makes any die, hub, or mold, or any part thereof, either of steel or of plaster, or of any other substance, in the likeness or similitude, as to the design or the inscription thereon, of any die, hub, or mold designated for the coining of the genuine coin of any foreign government; or

    Whoever, without lawful authority, possesses any such die, hub, or mold, or any part thereof, or conceals, or knowingly suffers the same to be used for the counterfeiting of any foreign coin—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 709][/us/stat/62/709]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 284 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 170, [35 Stat. 1120][/us/stat/35/1120]).

    Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Provision for $2,000 fine was increased to $5,000 to conform with [section 481 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s481].

    Changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
