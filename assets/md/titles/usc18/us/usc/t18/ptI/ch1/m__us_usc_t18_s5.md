## § 5. United States defined

    The term “United States”, as used in this title in a territorial sense, includes all places and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, except the Canal Zone.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 685][/us/stat/62/685].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 39, 133, 346, 381, 502, and 632, and [section 40 of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s40], U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense ([June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title XIII, § 1, [40 Stat. 231][/us/stat/40/231]).

    Section consolidates the first sentence of section 39, all of sections 133, 346, and 632, and the second sentences, respectively, of sections 381 and 502, all of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and [section 40 of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s40], U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense, with minor changes in phraseology.

    All of these sections and parts of sections were derived from section 1 of title XIII of said act of June 15, 1917. Said [section 40 of title 50][/us/usc/t50/s40], U.S.C., War and National Defense, has also been retained in that title, as it still relates to some sections therein which were not transferred to this title.

    The remainder of said [section 39 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s39], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from sections 2, 3, and 4 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, relating to jurisdiction and other matters, is almost entirely obsolete. The provisions still in force are incorporated in [section 3241 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3241].

    The remaining provisions of said sections 381 and 502 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said [section 1 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917][/us/act/1917-06-15/s1], are incorporated in sections 1364 and 2275 of this title.

 __Senate Revision Amendment__ 

    Words “, except the Canal Zone.” were substituted for the period in this section by Senate amendment. See Senate Report No. 1620, amendment No. 2, 80th Cong.

 __References in Text__ 

    For definition of Canal Zone, referred to in text, see [section 3602(b) of Title 22][/us/usc/t22/s3602/b], Foreign Relations and Intercourse.
