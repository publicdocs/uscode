## § 662. Receiving stolen property within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction

    Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, buys, receives, or conceals any money, goods, bank notes, or other thing which may be the subject of larceny, which has been feloniously taken, stolen, or embezzled, from any other person, knowing the same to have been so taken, stolen, or embezzled, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; but if the amount or value of thing so taken, stolen or embezzled does not exceed $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 731][/us/stat/62/731]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 606(a), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3511][/us/stat/110/3511].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 467 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 288, [35 Stat. 1145][/us/stat/35/1145]).

    Same language was inserted as in [section 661 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s661] for the same reason.

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)

    This accords with the recommendation of United States Attorney P. F. Herrick of Puerto Rico.

    Language as to order of trial was omitted and incorporated in [section 3435 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3435].

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “$1,000” for “$100”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in two places.
