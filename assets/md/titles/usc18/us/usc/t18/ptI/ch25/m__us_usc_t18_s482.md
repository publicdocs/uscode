 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 272 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 158][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s158], [35 Stat. 1118][/us/stat/35/1118]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2001—[Pub. L. 107–56][/us/pl/107/56] inserted “20 years” for “two years”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $2,000”.
