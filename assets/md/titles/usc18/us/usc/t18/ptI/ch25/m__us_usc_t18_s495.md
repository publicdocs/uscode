([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 711][/us/stat/62/711]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 73 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 29, [35 Stat. 1094][/us/stat/35/1094]).

    Reference in first paragraph to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
