## § 709. False advertising or misuse of names to indicate Federal agency

    Numerous sections were consolidated with changes both of phraseology and substance necessary to effect consolidation.

    The proviso of section 585 of said title 12 was omitted, since the consolidated section obviously cannot be construed as forbidding Federal agencies, boards, and corporations from using their legal names. The right to continue the use of a name, lawful on the effective date of this section, is preserved.

    Last paragraph is based upon section 587 of said title 12. Words “At the suit of” were substituted for “at the instance of”. United States Attorneys are the chief law officers of the districts. United States v. Smith, 1895, 15 S. Ct. 846, 158 U.S. 346, 39 L. Ed. 1011; McKay v. Rogers, C. C. A. Okl. 1936, 82 F. 2d 795. Federal courts will not recognize suits on behalf of the United States unless the Government is represented by a United States Attorney. Confiscation cases, La. 1868, 7 Wall. 454, 19 L. Ed. 196.

    The words “any duly authorized representative of any department or agency of the United States” were substituted for the enumeration of agencies which may make complaint thus making the provision more flexible and less cumbersome.

    This consolidated section reconciles the disparities and inconsistencies of 12 sections; thus providing a harmonious scheme for the punishment of similar offenses.

    The punishment provision was drawn from [section 587 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s587], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, but is in substance and effect the same as in sections 264v(1), 1441(d) and 1731(d) of said title 12, but the civil penalty of $50 per day which was in sections 583, 1128, and 1318 of said title 12, was omitted as inconsistent with later acts dealing with similar offenses. Too often actions to recover civil penalties result in judgments which cannot be collected, and yet as long as they remain uncollected they clog the administration of justice.

    It was necessary to substitute a fine in place of a $50 per diem penalty for business entities embraced in sections 583, 1128, and 1318 of said title 12, and fine and imprisonment for individuals responsible for such violations. Similarly the penalty of $1,000 fine in [section 1426 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1426], The Public Health and Welfare, was changed to permit alternative fine or imprisonment for individuals responsible for violation.
