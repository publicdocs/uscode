## § 954. False statements influencing foreign government

    Whoever, in relation to any dispute or controversy between a foreign government and the United States, willfully and knowingly makes any untrue statement, either orally or in writing, under oath before any person authorized and empowered to administer oaths, which the affiant has knowledge or reason to believe will, or may be used to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government, or of any officer or agent of any foreign government, to the injury of the United States, or with a view or intent to influence any measure of or action by the United States or any department or agency thereof, to the injury of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 744][/us/stat/62/744]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 231 of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s231], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse ([June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title VIII, § 1, [40 Stat. 226][/us/stat/40/226]; [Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72][/us/act/1940-03-28/ch72], § 6, [54 Stat. 80][/us/stat/54/80]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Words “department or agency” were added to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
