## § 2271. Conspiracy to destroy vessels

    Whoever, on the high seas, or within the United States, willfully and corruptly conspires, combines, and confederates with any other person, such other person being either within or without the United States, to cast away or otherwise destroy any vessel, with intent to injure any person that may have underwritten or may thereafter underwrite any policy of insurance thereon or on goods on board thereof, or with intent to injure any person that has lent or advanced, or may lend or advance, any money on such vessel on bottomry or respondentia; or

    Whoever, within the United States, builds, or fits out any vessel to be cast away or destroyed, with like intent—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 803][/us/stat/62/803]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 487 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 296, [35 Stat. 1146][/us/stat/35/1146]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Reference to a person who “aids in building or fitting out any vessel” was omitted as unnecessary in view of section 2 making all aiders guilty as principal.

    Changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000” in last par.
