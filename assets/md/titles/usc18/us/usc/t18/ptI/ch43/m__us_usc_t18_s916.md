## § 916. 4–H Club members or agents

    Whoever, falsely and with intent to defraud, holds himself out as or represents or pretends himself to be a member of, associated with, or an agent or representative for the 4–H clubs, an organization established by the Extension Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the land grant colleges, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 743][/us/stat/62/743]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(F)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/F], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 76c ([June 5, 1939, ch. 184, § 1][/us/act/1939-06-05/ch184/s1], [53 Stat. 809][/us/stat/53/809]).

    [Section 76c of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s76c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was incorporated in this section and [section 707 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s707].

    Reference to offense as a misdemeanor was omitted in view of definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted, since criminal punishment can follow only after conviction.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $300”.
