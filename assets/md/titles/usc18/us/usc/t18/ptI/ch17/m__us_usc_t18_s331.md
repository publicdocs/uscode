 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 279 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 165][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s165], [35 Stat. 1119][/us/stat/35/1119]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Changes were also made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $2,000”.

    1951—Act July 16, 1951, made section applicable to minor coins (5-cent and 1-cent pieces), and to fraudulent alteration of coins.
