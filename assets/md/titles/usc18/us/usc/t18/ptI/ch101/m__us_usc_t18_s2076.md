## § 2076. Clerk of United States District Court

    Whoever, being a clerk of a district court of the United States, willfully refuses or neglects to make or forward any report, certificate, statement, or document as required by law, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 796][/us/stat/62/796]; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 601(a)(11), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3498][/us/stat/110/3498].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 522 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s522], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary ([Feb. 22, 1875, ch. 95][/us/act/1875-02-22/ch95], § 6, [18 Stat. 334][/us/stat/18/334]).

    The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of “misdemeanor” in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1].

    The last sentence providing that conviction should not be a condition precedent to removal from office was omitted as unnecessary.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both” for “fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year” before period at end.
