## § 1301. Importing or transporting lottery tickets

    Whoever brings into the United States for the purpose of disposing of the same, or knowingly deposits with any express company or other common carrier for carriage, or carries in interstate or foreign commerce any paper, certificate, or instrument purporting to be or to represent a ticket, chance, share, or interest in or dependent upon the event of a lottery, gift enterprise, or similar scheme, offering prizes dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance, or any advertisement of, or list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of, any such lottery, gift enterprise, or similar scheme; or, being engaged in the business of procuring for a person in 1 State such a ticket, chance, share, or interest in a lottery, gift, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear. </sup></sup>  enterprise or similar scheme conducted by another State (unless that business is permitted under an agreement between the States in question or appropriate authorities of those States), knowingly transmits in interstate or foreign commerce information to be used for the purpose of procuring such a ticket, chance, share, or interest; or knowingly takes or receives any such paper, certificate, instrument, advertisement, or list so brought, deposited, or transported, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 762][/us/stat/62/762]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII, § 320905][/us/pl/103/322/s320905], title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2126][/us/stat/108/2126], 2147.)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 387 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 237][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s237], [35 Stat. 1136][/us/stat/35/1136]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “in interstate or foreign commerce” were substituted for involved enumeration of places, thus permitting section to be condensed and simplified without change of meaning. See definitive [section 10 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s10].

    The rewritten punishment provision is in lieu of the following: “for the first offense, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both; and for any subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not more than two years”. There seems no point in fixing a punishment for a second offense less than that for the first offense.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” and inserted “or, being engaged in the business of procuring for a person in 1 State such a ticket, chance, share, or interest in a lottery, gift, enterprise or similar scheme conducted by another State (unless that business is permitted under an agreement between the States in question or appropriate authorities of those States), knowingly transmits in interstate or foreign commerce information to be used for the purpose of procuring such a ticket, chance, share, or interest;” after “scheme;”.

 __Short Title of 1988 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 100–625, § 1][/us/pl/100/625/s1], Nov. 7, 1988, [102 Stat. 3205][/us/stat/102/3205], provided that: 

> “This Act \[amending sections 1304 and 1307 of this title and [section 3005 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s3005], Postal Service, and enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 1304 and 1307 of this title\] may be cited as the ‘Charity Games Advertising Clarification Act of 1988’.”
