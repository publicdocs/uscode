([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 786][/us/stat/62/786]; [Pub. L. 98–473, title II][/us/pl/98/473/tII], § 1109(a), Oct. 12, 1984, [98 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/98/2147]; [Pub. L. 99–646][/us/pl/99/646], § 52(a), Nov. 10, 1986, [100 Stat. 3606][/us/stat/100/3606]; [Pub. L. 100–690, title VI][/us/pl/100/690/tVI], § 6468(a), (b), Nov. 18, 1988, [102 Stat. 4376][/us/stat/102/4376]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title IX][/us/pl/103/322/tIX], § 90101, title XXXIII, § 330003(a), Sept. 13, 1994,[108 Stat. 1986][/us/stat/108/1986], 2140; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 601(m), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3502][/us/stat/110/3502]; [Pub. L. 109–162, title XI][/us/pl/109/162/tXI], § 1178, Jan. 5, 2006, [119 Stat. 3126][/us/stat/119/3126]; [Pub. L. 111–225][/us/pl/111/225], § 2, Aug. 10, 2010, [124 Stat. 2387][/us/stat/124/2387].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 753j, 908 ([May 14, 1930, ch. 274][/us/act/1930-05-14/ch274], § 11, [46 Stat. 327][/us/stat/46/327]; [May 27, 1930, ch. 339][/us/act/1930-05-27/ch339], § 8, [46 Stat. 390][/us/stat/46/390]).

    Section consolidates sections 753j and 908 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The section was broadened to include the taking or sending out of contraband from the institution. This was suggested by representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. In other respects the section was rewritten without change of substance.

    The words “narcotic”, “drug”, “weapon” and “contraband” were omitted, since the insertion of the words “contrary to any rule or regulation promulgated by the attorney general” preserves the intent of the original statutes.

    Words “guilty of a felony” were deleted as unnecessary in view of definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See also reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    Minor verbal changes also were made.

 __References in Text__ 

    Schedules I, II, and III, referred to in subsec. (d)(1)(A), (B), probably mean schedules I to III of the schedules of controlled substances, which are set out in [section 812(c) of Title 21][/us/usc/t21/s812/c], Food and Drugs.
