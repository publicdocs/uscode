([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 802][/us/stat/62/802]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], (L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 121, 253, 254, 628 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 65][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s65], [35 Stat. 1100][/us/stat/35/1100]; [June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title XI, § 18, [40 Stat. 230][/us/stat/40/230]; [May 18, 1934, ch. 299][/us/act/1934-05-18/ch299], §§ 1, 2, [48 Stat. 780][/us/stat/48/780], 781; [Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40][/us/act/1936-02-08/ch40], [49 Stat. 1105][/us/stat/49/1105]; [June 26, 1936, ch. 830][/us/act/1936-06-26/ch830], title I, § 3, [49 Stat. 1940][/us/stat/49/1940]; Reorg. Plan No. II, § 4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 Fed. Reg. 2731, [53 Stat. 1433][/us/stat/53/1433]; [June 13, 1940, ch. 359][/us/act/1940-06-13/ch359], [54 Stat. 391][/us/stat/54/391]).

    Section consolidates [section 628 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s628], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the portion of section 121 of said title relating to resistance of persons authorized to make searches.

    Punishment provided by [section 121 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s121], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was $2,000 fine and imprisonment for 1 year. Section 628 of said title was part of Espionage [Act of June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title XIII, § 1, [40 Stat. 231][/us/stat/40/231], prescribing fine of not more than $1,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 2 years for resisting service, execution of search warrant, or assaulting an officer.

    [Section 253 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s253], U.S.C., 1940 ed., enumerated United States marshals, deputies, and assistants, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, and numerous other officers, the killing of whom is denounced as a Federal offense.

    [Section 254 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s254], U.S.C., 1940 ed., denounced the assaulting of such officers and prescribed punishment therefor without regard to nature of duties involved or performed.

    In other words sections 253 and 254 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not limited to officers executing search warrants.

    Officers enumerated in [section 253 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s253], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were substantially all those who serve or execute search warrants. Therefore, the language and punishment under section 254 of said title constitute basis of this revised section. No change in legislative intent is involved, as the amendments of sections 253 and 254 of said title are the latest enactments.

    The provisions of [section 121 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s121], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to rescue of property from seizing officer or its destruction to prevent seizure, are incorporated in sections 2232 and 2233 of this title.

    Minor changes were made in translation and phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–322, § 330016(1)(L)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/L], substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
