 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 396 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 245, [35 Stat. 1138][/us/stat/35/1138]; [June 5, 1920, ch. 268][/us/act/1920-06-05/ch268], [41 Stat. 1060][/us/stat/41/1060]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “in interstate or foreign commerce” were substituted for ten lines of text without loss of meaning. (See definitive [section 10 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s10].)

    (See reviser’s note under [section 1461 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1461].)

    Minor changes in phraseology were made.
