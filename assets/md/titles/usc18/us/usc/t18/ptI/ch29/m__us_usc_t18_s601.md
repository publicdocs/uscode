L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 61c, 61g (Aug. 2, 1939, 11:50 a.m., E.S.T., ch. 410, §§ 4, 8, [53 Stat. 1147][/us/stat/53/1147], 1148).

    This section consolidates sections 61c and 61g of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    The words “except as required by law” were used as sufficient to cover the reference to the exception made to the provisions of subsection (b), [section 61h of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s61h], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which expressly prescribes the circumstances under which a person may be lawfully deprived of his employment and compensation therefor.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000” in concluding provisions.

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–453][/us/pl/94/453] struck out provisions relating to deprivations based upon race, creed, and color which are now set out in [section 246 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s246], replaced term “political activity” with more precise terms and definitions, and raised the amount of maximum fine from $1,000 to $10,000.
