## § 440. Mail contracts

    Whoever, being a person employed in the Postal Service, becomes interested in any contract for carrying the mail, or acts as agent, with or without compensation, for any contractor or person offering to become a contractor in any business before the Postal Service, shall be fined under this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 704][/us/stat/62/704]; [Pub. L. 91–375, § 6(j)(3)][/us/pl/91/375/s6/j/3], Aug. 12, 1970, [84 Stat. 777][/us/stat/84/777]; [Pub.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 356 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 226][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s226], [35 Stat. 1134][/us/stat/35/1134]).

    Provision for dismissal from office was omitted since this might be handled better administratively.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $5,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] substituted “Postal Service” for “Post Office Department” before “, shall be fined”.

 __Effective Date of 1970 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service and published by it in the Federal Register, see [section 15(a) of Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375/s15/a], set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s101], Postal Service.
