## § 2703. Required disclosure of customer communications or records

    (a) __Contents of Wire or Electronic Communications in Electronic Storage.—__ 

    A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication, that is in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for one hundred and eighty days or less, only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) by a court of competent jurisdiction. A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communications services of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that has been in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for more than one hundred and eighty days by the means available under subsection (b) of this section.

    (b) __Contents of Wire or Electronic Communications in a Remote Computing Service.—__ 

        (1)

         A governmental entity may require a provider of remote computing service to disclose the contents of any wire or electronic communication to which this paragraph is made applicable by paragraph (2) of this subsection—

            (A) without required notice to the subscriber or customer, if the governmental entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

            (B)

             with prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer if the governmental entity—

                (i) uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State statute or a Federal or State grand jury or trial subpoena; or

                (ii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection (d) of this section;

                except that delayed notice may be given pursuant to [section 2705 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2705].

        (2)

         Paragraph (1) is applicable with respect to any wire or electronic communication that is held or maintained on that service—

            (A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic transmission from (or created by means of computer processing of communications received by means of electronic transmission from), a subscriber or customer of such remote computing service; and

            (B) solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services to such subscriber or customer, if the provider is not authorized to access the contents of any such communications for purposes of providing any services other than storage or computer processing.

    (c) __Records Concerning Electronic Communication Service or Remote Computing Service.—__ 

        (1)

         A governmental entity may require a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service (not including the contents of communications) only when the governmental entity—

            (A) obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) by a court of competent jurisdiction;

            (B) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection (d) of this section;

            (C) has the consent of the subscriber or customer to such disclosure;

            (D) submits a formal written request relevant to a law enforcement investigation concerning telemarketing fraud for the name, address, and place of business of a subscriber or customer of such provider, which subscriber or customer is engaged in telemarketing (as such term is defined in [section 2325 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2325]); or

            (E) seeks information under paragraph (2).

        (2)

         A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service shall disclose to a governmental entity the—

            (A) name;

            (B) address;

            (C) local and long distance telephone connection records, or records of session times and durations;

            (D) length of service (including start date) and types of service utilized;

            (E) telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or identity, including any temporarily assigned network address; and

            (F) means and source of payment for such service (including any credit card or bank account number),

            of a subscriber to or customer of such service when the governmental entity uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State statute or a Federal or State grand jury or trial subpoena or any means available under paragraph (1).

        (3) A governmental entity receiving records or information under this subsection is not required to provide notice to a subscriber or customer.

    (d) __Requirements for Court Order.—__ 

    A court order for disclosure under subsection (b) or (c) may be issued by any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction and shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. In the case of a State governmental authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order pursuant to this section, on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may quash or modify such order, if the information or records requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an undue burden on such provider.

    (e) __No Cause of Action Against a Provider Disclosing Information Under This Chapter.—__ 

    No cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communication service, its officers, employees, agents, or other specified persons for providing information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the terms of a court order, warrant, subpoena, statutory authorization, or certification under this chapter.

    (f) __Requirement To Preserve Evidence.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        A provider of wire or electronic communication services or a remote computing service, upon the request of a governmental entity, shall take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

        (2) __Period of retention.—__ 

        Records referred to in paragraph (1) shall be retained for a period of 90 days, which shall be extended for an additional 90-day period upon a renewed request by the governmental entity.

    (g) __Presence of Officer Not Required.—__ 

    Notwithstanding [section 3105 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3105], the presence of an officer shall not be required for service or execution of a search warrant issued in accordance with this chapter requiring disclosure by a provider of electronic communications service or remote computing service of the contents of communications or records or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service.
