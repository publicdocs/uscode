([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 731][/us/stat/62/731]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(E)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/E], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 76a, 76b ([June 29, 1932, ch. 306][/us/act/1932-06-29/ch306], §§ 1, 2, [47 Stat. 342][/us/stat/47/342]; [May 22, 1939, ch. 141][/us/act/1939-05-22/ch141], [53 Stat. 752][/us/stat/53/752]).

    Sections were consolidated.

    The term “department or agency” was substituted for “department or independent office” in two places to embrace all properly constituted agencies as defined in [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6] and to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $250”.
