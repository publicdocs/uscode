## § 1915. Compromise of customs liabilities

    Whoever, being an officer of the United States, without lawful authority compromises or abates or attempts to compromise or abate any claim of the United States arising under the customs laws for any fine, penalty or forfeiture, or in any manner relieves or attempts to relieve any person, vessel, vehicle, merchandise or baggage therefrom, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 793][/us/stat/62/793]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1616 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1616], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties ([June 17, 1930, ch. 497][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch497], title IV, § 616, [46 Stat. 757][/us/stat/46/757]).

    Designation of the offense as a felony was omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    Words “and upon conviction thereof” were also omitted as unnecessary, since punishment could not be imposed until after conviction.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
