 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 9, 11, 13 ([June 28, 1940, ch. 439][/us/act/1940-06-28/ch439], title I, §§ 1, 3, 5, [54 Stat. 670][/us/stat/54/670], 671).

    Section consolidates sections 9, 11, and 13 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with only such changes of phraseology as were necessary to effect consolidation.

    The revised section extends the provisions so as to include the Coast Guard Reserve in its coverage.

    Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, as punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.

    Reference to conspiracy to commit any of the prohibited acts was omitted as covered by the general law incorporated in [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s371]. (See reviser’s note under that section.)

    Minor changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section \[section 46\] inserts the words, “Air Force,” in subsection (b) of [section 2387 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s2387], U.S.C., in view of the establishment in 1947 of this separate branch of the armed services.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–163][/us/pl/109/163] substituted “Navy Reserve” for “Naval Reserve”.

    1994—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000” in last par.

    1949—Subsec. (b). Act May 24, 1949, made section applicable to the Air Force.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under [section 542 of Title 6][/us/usc/t6/s542].

    Functions of all officers of Department of the Treasury and functions of all agencies and employees of such Department transferred, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of the Treasury, with power vested in him to authorize their performance or performance of any of his functions, by any of such officers, agencies, and employees, by Reorg.
