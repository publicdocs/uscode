    Whoever passes, utters, publishes, sells, possesses, or brings into the United States any false, forged, or counterfeit coin or bar, knowing the same to be false, forged, or counterfeit, with intent to defraud any body politic or corporate, or any person, or attempts the commission of any offense described in this paragraph—

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 708][/us/stat/62/708]; [Pub. L. 89–81, title II][/us/pl/89/81/tII], § 211(a), July 23, 1965, [79 Stat. 257][/us/stat/79/257]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 277 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 163, [35 Stat. 1119][/us/stat/35/1119]).

    Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    The provision for imprisonment for 10 years was changed to 15 years to conform to sections 471 and 472 of this title.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.

    1965—[Pub. L. 89–81][/us/pl/89/81] struck out “Gold or silver” before “Coins or bars” in section catchline, changed the description of the United States coins covered in first par. from gold or silver coins to any coin of a denomination higher than 5 cents, and made minor structural changes in second par.
