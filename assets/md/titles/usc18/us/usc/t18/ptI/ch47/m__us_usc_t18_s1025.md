 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 467a ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 288A, as added [Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 434][/us/act/1939-08-05/ch434], [53 Stat. 1205][/us/stat/53/1205]).

    Words “upon any waters or vessel within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States” were substituted for “upon the high seas or on any waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, or within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State on board any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, or District thereof”, near beginning of section. The deleted words are not necessary in view of definitive [section 7 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s7].

    Words “whatsoever with intent to defraud” were omitted as being included in the preceding term “false pretenses”.

    The punishment provision was revised to include a misdemeanor punishment (not more than $1,000 or one year, or both) where the offense involves $100 or less. (See reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section \[section 22\] corrects a typographical error in [section 1025 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1025], U.S.C.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “$1,000” for “$100”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” after “pretenses, shall be” and for “fined not more than $1,000” after “he shall be”.

    1949—Act May 24, 1949, corrected spelling of “pretense”.
