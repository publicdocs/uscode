(Added [Pub. L. 102–519, title I, § 101(a)][/us/pl/102/519/s101/a], Oct. 25, 1992, [106 Stat. 3384][/us/stat/106/3384]; amended [Pub. L. 103–322, title VI, § 60003(a)(14)][/us/pl/103/322/s60003/a/14], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 1970][/us/stat/108/1970]; [Pub. L. 104–217, § 2][/us/pl/104/217/s2], Oct. 1, 1996, [110 Stat. 3020][/us/stat/110/3020].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—Par. (2). [Pub. L. 104–217][/us/pl/104/217] inserted “, including any conduct that, if the conduct occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242 of this title” after “[section 1365 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1365]”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322, § 60003(a)(14)][/us/pl/103/322/s60003/a/14], which directed the amendment of [section 2119(3) of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s2119/3] by substituting “, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm” for “, possessing a firearm as defined in [section 921 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s921],”, was executed by making the substitution in introductory provisions rather than in par. (3), to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    Par. (3). [Pub. L. 103–322, § 60003(a)(14)][/us/pl/103/322/s60003/a/14], inserted before period at end “, or sentenced to death”.
