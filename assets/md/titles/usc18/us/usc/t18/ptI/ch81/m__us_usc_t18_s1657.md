 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 498 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 307][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s307], [35 Stat. 1148][/us/stat/35/1148]).

    Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in last par.

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647], which directed insertion of “section 11, 12, or 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act” after “consideration of any action brought under”, could not be executed because the words “consideration of any action brought under” did not appear.
