## § 210. Offer to procure appointive public office

    Whoever pays or offers or promises any money or thing of value, to any person, firm, or corporation in consideration of the use or promise to use any influence to procure any appointive office or place under the United States for any person, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 694][/us/stat/62/694], § 210, formerly § 214; renumbered § 210, [Pub. L. 87–849, § 1(b)][/us/pl/87/849/s1/b], Oct. 23, 1962, [76 Stat. 1125][/us/stat/76/1125]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/H], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on Title 18, U. S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 149 and 151 (Dec. 11, 1926, c. 3, §§ 1, 3, [44 Stat. 918][/us/stat/44/918]).

    Changes of style and substance were made in this section.

    Term “or place” was inserted after words “appointive office” in order to give broader scope to the section and also to follow the phraseology used in similar provisions of [section 202 of Title 18][/us/usc/t18/s202], U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 216 \[repealed\] of this title. (See 46 Corpus Juris 924, where it is explained that the work “places” is used in a less technical sense than the word “offices”.)

    The punishment provision, added at the end of this section and section 215 \[now section 211\] of this title to secure uniformity of style throughout this chapter, was originally enacted as a separate section, incorporating the other two by reference. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior section 210, [act June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 693][/us/stat/62/693], related to acceptance of a bribe by a witness, prior to the general amendment of this chapter by [Pub. L. 87–849][/us/pl/87/849] and is substantially covered in revised section 201.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
