([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 766][/us/stat/62/766]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title II][/us/pl/104/208/dC/tII], § 211(a)(2), Sept. 30, 1996, [110 Stat. 3009–569][/us/stat/110/3009-569]; [Pub. L. 107–273, div. B, title IV][/us/pl/107/273/dB/tIV], § 4002(a)(3), Nov. 2, 2002, [116 Stat. 1806][/us/stat/116/1806].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on subsections (a) pars. (2)–(5), (7), (b), and (d) of [section 746 of Title 8][/us/usc/t8/s746], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality ([Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876][/us/act/1940-10-14/ch876], § 346(a), pars. (2)–(5), (7), (b), (d), [54 Stat. 1163][/us/stat/54/1163], 1164, 1167).

    Section consolidates five similar paragraphs, and the punishment provisions of subsection (d) of said [section 746 of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s746], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, with minor necessary changes in translations and phraseology. Numerous references to aiding and assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are principals under definitive [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “a certificate of arrival or” were inserted before “any certificate” in subsection (b), so as to remove any doubt as to scope of section.

 __Amendments__ 

    2002—[Pub. L. 107–273][/us/pl/107/273] substituted “to facilitate” for “to facility” in last par.

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208] substituted “imprisoned not more than 25 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism (as defined in [section 2331 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2331])), 20 years (if the offense was committed to facilitate a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [section 929(a) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s929/a])), 10 years (in the case of the first or second such offense, if the offense was not committed to facility such an act of international terrorism or a drug trafficking crime), or 15 years (in the case of any other offense)” for “imprisoned not more than five years” in last par.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.

 __Effective Date of 1996 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208] applicable with respect to offenses occurring on or after Sept. 30, 1996, see [section 211(c) of Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208/s211/c], set out as a note under [section 1028 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1028].
