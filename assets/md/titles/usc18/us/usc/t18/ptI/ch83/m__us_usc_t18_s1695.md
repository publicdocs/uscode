## § 1695. Carriage of matter out of mail on vessels

    Whoever carries any letter or packet on board any vessel which carries the mail, otherwise than in such mail, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 777][/us/stat/62/777]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(A), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 308 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 185, [35 Stat. 1124][/us/stat/35/1124]).

    The words “thirty days” were substituted for “one month,” to make the term of imprisonment more definite and to conform to other comparable sections. (See [section 1693 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1693].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $50”.

 __Study of Private Carriage of Mail; Reports to President and Congress__ 

    Congressional findings of need for study and reevaluation of restrictions on private carriage of letters and packets contained in this section and submission by United States Postal Service of reports to President and Congress for modernization of law, regulations, and administrative practices, see [section 7 of Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375/s7], set out as a note under [section 601 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s601], Postal Service.
