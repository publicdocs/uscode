## § 335. Circulation of obligations of expired corporations

    Whoever, being a director, officer, or agent of a corporation created by Act of Congress, the charter of which has expired, or trustee thereof, or an agent of such trustee, or a person having in his possession or under his control the property of such corporation for the purpose of paying or redeeming its notes and obligations, knowingly issues, reissues, or utters as money, or in any other way knowingly puts in circulation any bill, note, check, draft, or other security purporting to have been made by any such corporation, or by any officer thereof, or purporting to have been made under authority derived therefrom, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 700][/us/stat/62/700]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/L], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 289 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 174][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s174], [35 Stat. 1122][/us/stat/35/1122]).

    The reference to persons aiding was omitted as unnecessary, since such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    The last sentence excepting bona fide holders in due course was omitted as surplusage.

    Other changes in phraseology also were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
