## § 241. Conspiracy against rights

    If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or

    If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured—

    They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 696][/us/stat/62/696]; [Pub. L. 90–284, title I][/us/pl/90/284/tI], § 103(a), Apr. 11, 1968, [82 Stat. 75][/us/stat/82/75]; [Pub. L. 100–690, title VII][/us/pl/100/690/tVII], § 7018(a), (b)(1), Nov. 18, 1988, [102 Stat. 4396][/us/stat/102/4396]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title VI][/us/pl/103/322/tVI], § 60006(a), title XXXII, §§ 320103(a), 320201(a), title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 1970][/us/stat/108/1970], 2109, 2113, 2147; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], §§ 604(b)(14)(A), 607(a), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3507][/us/stat/110/3507], 3511.)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 51 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 19, [35 Stat. 1092][/us/stat/35/1092]).

    Clause making conspirator ineligible to hold office was omitted as incongruous because it attaches ineligibility to hold office to a person who may be a private citizen and who was convicted of conspiracy to violate a specific statute. There seems to be no reason for imposing such a penalty in the case of one individual crime, in view of the fact that other crimes do not carry such a severe consequence. The experience of the Department of Justice is that this unusual penalty has been an obstacle to successful prosecutions for violations of the act.

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Minor changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294], § 607(a), substituted “any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District” for “any State, Territory, or District” in first par.

    [Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294], § 604(b)(14)(A), repealed [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 320103(a)(1). See 1994 Amendment note below.

L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 320103(a)(2)–(4), in third par., substituted “results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both” for “results, they shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life”.
