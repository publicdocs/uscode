## § 1002. Possession of false papers to defraud United States

    Whoever, knowingly and with intent to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, possesses any false, altered, forged, or counterfeited writing or document for the purpose of enabling another to obtain from the United States, or from any agency, officer or agent thereof, any sum of money, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 749][/us/stat/62/749]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/L], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 74 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 30][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s30], [35 Stat. 1094][/us/stat/35/1094]).

    Words “or any agency thereof” after “United States” and word “agency” after “any” and before “officer,” were inserted to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definition of “agency” in [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    The maximum fine of “$10,000” was substituted for “$500” in order to conform punishment provisions to those of comparable sections. (See [section 1001 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1001].)

    Minor verbal change was made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
