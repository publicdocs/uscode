([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 746][/us/stat/62/746]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/H], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 24 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 12][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s12], [35 Stat. 1090][/us/stat/35/1090]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Mandatory punishment was rephrased in the alternative.

    Words “within the United States” were substituted for “within the territory or jurisdiction” etc., in view of the definition of United States in [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5].

    Minor changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
