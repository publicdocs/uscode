 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 753h, 909 ([May 14, 1930, ch. 274, § 9][/us/act/1930-05-14/ch274/s9], [46 Stat. 327][/us/stat/46/327]; [May 27, 1930, ch. 339, § 9][/us/act/1930-05-27/ch339/s9], [46 Stat. 390][/us/stat/46/390]; [Aug. 3, 1935, ch. 432][/us/act/1935-08-03/ch432], [49 Stat. 513][/us/stat/49/513]).

    Sections 753h and 909 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were consolidated. Section 753h is later and more comprehensive. The substance of its provisions was adopted.

    References to offenses as felonies or misdemeanors were omitted in view of definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See also reviser’s notes under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    Mandatory provision as to separate sentences and order of service was omitted in order to permit court to exercise discretion as to whether sentences should be concurrent or consecutive and to obviate administration problems in enforcement of section.

    Words “or employee” were inserted to remove ambiguity as to scope of section.

    Reference to “custody or confinement is for extradition” was inserted to avoid possible ambiguity.

    Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” after “any offense, be” and for “fined not more than $1,000” after “conviction, be” in subsec. (a) and substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in subsec. (b).

    1988—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 100–690][/us/pl/100/690] inserted “, or for exclusion or expulsion proceedings under the immigration laws,” after “extradition”.

    1965—[Pub. L. 89–176][/us/pl/89/176] inserted “or facility” after “institution”.

    1963—[Pub. L. 88–251][/us/pl/88/251] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a) and added subsec. (b).

 __Change of Name__ 

    Words “magistrate judge” substituted for “magistrate” in subsecs. (a) and (b) pursuant to [section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650][/us/pl/101/650/s321], set out as a note under [section 631 of Title 28][/us/usc/t28/s631], Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
