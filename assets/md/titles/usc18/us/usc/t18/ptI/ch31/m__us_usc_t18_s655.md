## § 655. Theft by bank examiner

    Whoever, being a bank examiner or assistant examiner, steals, or unlawfully takes, or unlawfully conceals any money, note, draft, bond, or security or any other property of value in the possession of any bank or banking institution which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or which is an organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of the Federal Reserve Act, or from any safe deposit box in or adjacent to the premises of such bank, branch, agency, or organization, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; but if the amount taken or concealed does not exceed $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and shall be disqualified from holding office as a national bank examiner or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation examiner.

    This section shall apply to all public examiners and assistant examiners who examine member banks of the Federal Reserve System, banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, branches or agencies of foreign banks (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or organizations operating under section 25 or section 25(a) 1 of the Federal Reserve Act, whether appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, by a Federal Reserve Agent, by a Federal Reserve bank, or by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or appointed or elected under the laws of any State; but shall not apply to private examiners or assistant examiners employed only by a clearing-house association or by the directors of a bank.

L. 101–647, title XXV][/us/pl/101/647/tXXV], § 2597(e), Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4909][/us/stat/104/4909]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(H), (K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 606(a), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3511][/us/stat/110/3511].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 593 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s593], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ([Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6], § 22, [38 Stat. 272][/us/stat/38/272]; [Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177][/us/act/1918-09-26/ch177], § 5, [40 Stat. 970][/us/stat/40/970]; [Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191][/us/act/1927-02-25/ch191], § 15, [44 Stat. 1232][/us/stat/44/1232]; [Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614][/us/act/1935-08-23/ch614], § 326(a), [49 Stat. 715][/us/stat/49/715]).

    Other provisions of [section 593 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s593], U.S.C. 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, are incorporated in sections 217 and 218 of this title.

    The words “and shall upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    The phrase “bank or banking institution which is a member of the Federal Reserve System or which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation” was substituted for “member bank or insured bank” to avoid the use of a definitive section based on sections 221a, 264(e)(8), and 588a of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. Words “banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation” were substituted for “insured banks” in second paragraph, for the same reason.

    Punishment provision harmonized with that of [section 656 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s656]. (See also, reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)

    Changes in phraseology were also made.
