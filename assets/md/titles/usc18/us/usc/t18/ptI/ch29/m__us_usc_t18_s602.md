([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 722][/us/stat/62/722]; [Pub. L. 96–187, title II, § 201(a)(3)][/us/pl/96/187/s201/a/3], Jan. 8, 1980, [93 Stat. 1367][/us/stat/93/1367]; [Pub. L. 103–94, § 4(a)][/us/pl/103/94/s4/a], Oct. 6, 1993, [107 Stat. 1004][/us/stat/107/1004]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 109–435, title VI, § 604(f)][/us/pl/109/435/s604/f], Dec. 20, 2006, [120 Stat. 3242][/us/stat/120/3242].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 208, 212 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], §§ 118, 122, [35 Stat. 1110][/us/stat/35/1110]; [Feb. 28, 1925, ch. 368, § 312][/us/act/1925-02-28/ch368/s312], [43 Stat. 1073][/us/stat/43/1073]).

    This section consolidates sections 208 and 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    This section, like [section 201 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s201], was expanded to embrace all officers or persons acting on behalf of any independent agencies or Government-owned or controlled corporations by inserting words “or any department or agency thereof.” (See definitive [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    The punishment provision was taken from [section 212 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s212], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which, by reference, made the punishment applicable to the crime described in this section.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 301(8) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, referred to in subsec. (a)(4), is classified to [section 431(8) of Title 2][/us/usc/t2/s431/8], The Congress.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–435][/us/pl/109/435] substituted “Postal Regulatory Commission” for “Postal Rate Commission”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “under this title” for “not more than $5,000”, could not be executed because the phrase “not more than $5,000” does not appear in text. See 1993 Amendment note below.

    1993—[Pub. L. 103–94][/us/pl/103/94] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), substituted “; to knowingly solicit any contribution within the meaning of section 301(8) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 from any other such officer, employee, or person. Any person who violates this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both” for “to knowingly solicit, any contribution within the meaning of section 301(8) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 from any other such officer, employee, or person. Any person who violates this section shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both” in par. (4), and added subsec. (b).

    1980—[Pub. L. 96–187][/us/pl/96/187] amended section generally to conform its terms to revision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by title I of [Pub. L. 96–187][/us/pl/96/187].

 __Effective Date of 1993 Amendment; Savings Provision__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 103–94][/us/pl/103/94] effective 120 days after Oct. 6, 1993, but not to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under amended provision, which is to be treated as remaining in force for purpose of sustaining any proper proceeding or action for enforcement of that penalty, forfeiture, or liability, and no provision of [Pub. L. 103–94][/us/pl/103/94] to affect any proceedings with respect to which charges were filed on or before 120 days after Oct. 6, 1993, with orders to be issued in such proceedings and appeals taken therefrom as if [Pub. L. 103–94][/us/pl/103/94] had not been enacted, see [section 12 of Pub. L. 103–94][/us/pl/103/94/s12], set out as an Effective Date; Savings Provision note under [section 7321 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s7321], Government Organization and Employees.

 __Effective Date of 1980 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 96–187][/us/pl/96/187] effective Jan. 8, 1980, see [section 301(a) of Pub. L. 96–187][/us/pl/96/187/s301/a], set out as a note under [section 431 of Title 2][/us/usc/t2/s431], The Congress.
