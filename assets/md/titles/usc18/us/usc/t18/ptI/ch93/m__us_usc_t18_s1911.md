## § 1911. Receiver mismanaging property

    Whoever, being a receiver, trustee, or manager in possession of any property in any cause pending in any court of the United States, willfully fails to manage and operate such property according to the requirements of the valid laws of the State in which such property shall be situated, in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in possession thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 792][/us/stat/62/792]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(J)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/J], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based upon [section 124 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s124], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary ([Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 65][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s65], [36 Stat. 1104][/us/stat/36/1104]).

    Word “trustee” was inserted after “receiver” so as to make it clear that persons holding such office are included in the enumeration of court officers who are subject to the provisions of this section.

    Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement, but without change of substance or meaning.

    Other provisions of [section 124 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s124], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were retained in that title.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $3,000”.
