([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 808][/us/stat/62/808]; [July 24, 1956, ch. 678, § 2][/us/act/1956-07-24/ch678/s2], [70 Stat. 623][/us/stat/70/623]; [Pub. L. 87–486][/us/pl/87/486], June 19, 1962, [76 Stat. 103][/us/stat/76/103]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(N)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/N], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2148][/us/stat/108/2148].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 10, 11, 13 ([June 28, 1940, ch. 439][/us/act/1940-06-28/ch439], title I, §§ 2, 3, 5, [54 Stat. 670][/us/stat/54/670], 671).

    Section consolidates sections 10, 11, and 13 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. [Section 13 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s13], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which contained the punishment provisions applicable to sections 10 and 11 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was combined with [section 11 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s11], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and added to this section.

    In first paragraph, words “the Government of the United States or the government of any State, Territory, District or possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein” were substituted for “any government in the United States”.

    In second and third paragraphs, word “such” was inserted after “any” and before “government”, and words “in the United States” which followed “government” were omitted.

    In view of these changes, the provisions of subsection (b) of [section 10 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s10], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which defined the term “government in the United States” were omitted as unnecessary.

    Reference to conspiracy to commit any of the prohibited acts was omitted as covered by the general conspiracy provision, incorporated in [section 371 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s371]. (See reviser’s note under that section.)

    Words “upon conviction thereof” which preceded “be fined” were omitted as surplusage, as punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    The phraseology was considerably changed to effect consolidation but without any change of substance.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $20,000” in fourth and fifth pars.

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–486][/us/pl/87/486] defined the terms “organizes” and “organize”.

    1956—Act July 24, 1956, substituted “$20,000” for “$10,000”, and “twenty years” for “ten years” in the paragraph prescribing penalties applicable to advocating overthrow of government and inserted provisions relating to conspiracy to commit any offense named in this section.

 __Effective Date of 1956 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by act July 24, 1956, as applicable only with respect to offenses committed on and after July 24, 1956, see section 3 of act July 24, 1956, set out as a note under [section 2384 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2384].
