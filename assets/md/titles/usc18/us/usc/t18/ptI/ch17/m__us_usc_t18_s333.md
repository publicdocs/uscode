## § 333. Mutilation of national bank obligations

    Whoever mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 700][/us/stat/62/700]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(B), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 291 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 176, [35 Stat. 1122][/us/stat/35/1122]).

    Words “or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System” were inserted because the paper of such banks has almost supplanted national bank currency.

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Minor changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $100”.
