## § 707. 4–H club emblem fraudulently used

    Whoever, with intent to defraud, wears or displays the sign or emblem of the 4–H clubs, consisting of a green four-leaf clover with stem, and the letter H in white or gold on each leaflet, or any insignia in colorable imitation thereof, for the purpose of inducing the belief that he is a member of, associated with, or an agent or representative for the 4–H clubs; or

    Whoever, whether an individual, partnership, corporation or association, other than the 4–H clubs and those duly authorized by them, the representatives of the United States Department of Agriculture, the land grant colleges, and persons authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, uses, within the United States, such emblem or any sign, insignia, or symbol in colorable imitation thereof, or the words “4–H Club” or “4–H Clubs” or any combination of these or other words or characters in colorable imitation thereof—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

    This section shall not make unlawful the use of any such emblem, sign, insignia or words which was lawful on the date of enactment of this title.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 733][/us/stat/62/733]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(E)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/E], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2146][/us/stat/108/2146].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 76c and 76d ([June 5, 1939, ch. 184][/us/act/1939-06-05/ch184], §§ 1, 2, [53 Stat. 809][/us/stat/53/809]).

    The first provision of [section 76c of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s76c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to fraudulently pretending to be a member of a 4–H Club was incorporated in [section 916 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s916].

    The language describing the emblem was transposed.

    Unnecessary words were omitted from punishment provision, and “$250” was substituted for “$300” to make the punishment consonant with the penalties provided for similar offenses. (See sections 701, 704, 705 of this title for similar offenses.)

    The language of [section 76d of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s76d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., was rephrased and inserted after “whoever,” in the second paragraph.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __References in Text__ 

    The date of enactment of this title, referred to in text, means June 25, 1948.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $250” in third par.
