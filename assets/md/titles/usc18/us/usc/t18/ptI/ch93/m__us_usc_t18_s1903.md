## § 1903. Speculation in stocks or commodities affecting crop insurance

    Whoever, while acting in any official capacity in the administration of any Act of Congress relating to crop insurance or to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation speculates in any agricultural commodity or product thereof, to which such enactments apply, or in contracts relating thereto, or in the stock or membership interests of any association or corporation engaged in handling, processing, or disposing of any such commodity or product, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 790][/us/stat/62/790]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1514(b) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1514/b], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture ([Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30][/us/act/1938-02-16/ch30], title V, § 514(b), [52 Stat. 76][/us/stat/52/76]).

    Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage since punishment can be imposed only after a conviction.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology and translations.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.
