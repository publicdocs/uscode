([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 797][/us/stat/62/797]; [Pub. L. 98–473, title II][/us/pl/98/473/tII], § 223(d), Oct. 12, 1984, [98 Stat. 2028][/us/stat/98/2028]; [Pub. L. 101–647, title XXXV][/us/pl/101/647/tXXXV], § 3562, Nov. 29, 1990, [104 Stat. 4927][/us/stat/104/4927]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXII], §§ 320602, 320903(a)(3), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2115][/us/stat/108/2115], 2124; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 604(b)(17), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3507][/us/stat/110/3507].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 320 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 197, [35 Stat. 1126][/us/stat/35/1126]; [Aug. 26, 1935, ch. 694][/us/act/1935-08-26/ch694], [49 Stat. 867][/us/stat/49/867]).

    The attention of Congress is directed to the mandatory minimum punishment provisions of sections 2113(e) and 2114 of this title. These were left unchanged because of the controversial question involved. Such legislative attempts to control the discretion of the sentencing judge are contrary to the opinions of experienced criminologists and criminal law experts. They are calculated to work manifest injustice in many cases.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] amended [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 320602. See 1994 Amendment note below.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 320903(a)(3), inserted “or attempts to rob” after “robs” in subsec. (a).

    [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], § 320602, as amended by [Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294], § 604(b)(17), designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, substituted “A person who” for “Whoever”, and added subsec. (b).

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–647][/us/pl/101/647] inserted a comma after “money” in section catchline.

    1984—[Pub. L. 98–473][/us/pl/98/473], which directed insertion of “not more than” after “imprisoned”, was executed by making the insertion after “imprisoned” the second time appearing.
