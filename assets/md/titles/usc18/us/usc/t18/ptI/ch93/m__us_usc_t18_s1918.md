    The section is rewritten to conform to the style of title 18. The statement of the acts prohibited is supplied from the [Act of Aug. 9, 1955, ch. 690, § 1][/us/act/1955-08-09/ch690/s1], [69 Stat. 624][/us/stat/69/624], which is codified in [section 7311 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s7311], United States Code.

    The words “From and after July 1, 1956”, appearing in the Act of June 29, 1956, are omitted as executed.

    The words “shall be guilty of a felony” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000” in concluding provisions.
