 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 338 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 215][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s215], [35 Stat. 1130][/us/stat/35/1130]).

    The obsolete argot of the underworld was deleted as suggested by Hon. Emerich B. Freed, United States district judge, in a paper read before the 1944 Judicial Conference for the sixth circuit in which he said:

    A brief reference to § 1341, which proposes to reenact the present section covering the use of the mails to defraud. This section is almost a page in length, is involved, and contains a great deal of superfluous language, including such terms as “sawdust swindle, green articles, green coin, green goods and green cigars.” This section could be greatly simplified, and now-meaningless language eliminated.

    The other surplusage was likewise eliminated and the section simplified without change of meaning.

    A reference to causing to be placed any letter, etc. in any post office, or station thereof, etc. was omitted as unnecessary because of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section \[section 34\] corrects a typographical error in [section 1341 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1341], U.S.C.
