    Whoever knowingly and falsely certifies that the declarant, affiant, or witness named in such declaration, affidavit, voucher, endorsement, or other paper or writing personally appeared before him and was sworn thereto, or acknowledged the execution thereof—

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 699][/us/stat/62/699]; [Pub. L. 102–54][/us/pl/102/54], § 13(f)(1), June 13, 1991, [105 Stat. 275][/us/stat/105/275]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 81 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s81], [section 126 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s126], Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans’ Relief, and [section 787 of title 43][/us/usc/t43/s787], Public Lands, all of U.S.C., 1940 ed. (R.S. § 4746; [July 7, 1898, ch. 578][/us/act/1898-07-07/ch578], [30 Stat. 718][/us/stat/30/718]; [Aug. 17, 1912, ch. 301][/us/act/1912-08-17/ch301], § 1, [37 Stat. 312][/us/stat/37/312]; [July 3, 1930, ch. 863][/us/act/1930-07-03/ch863], § 2, [46 Stat. 1016][/us/stat/46/1016]).

    Reference to persons aiding or assisting or causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “or bounty land”, before “prosecution of any claim for pension”, were omitted as obsolete. (See reviser’s note under [section 290 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s290].)

    Upon authority of 1930 enactment words “Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs” were substituted for “Commissioner of Pensions or of the Secretary of the Interior”, which appeared in 1898 enactment.

    The fine was changed from “$500” for “$10,000” to conform with punishment provision of [section 287 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s287].

    Minor changes in phraseology were also made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”.

    1991—[Pub. L. 102–54][/us/pl/102/54] substituted “Secretary of Veterans Affairs” for “Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs”.
