## § 478. Foreign obligations or securities

    Whoever, within the United States, with intent to defraud, falsely makes, alters, forges, or counterfeits any bond, certificate, obligation, or other security of any foreign government, purporting to be or in imitation of any such security issued under the authority of such foreign government, or any treasury note, bill, or promise to pay, lawfully issued by such foreign government and intended to circulate as money, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 270 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 156][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s156], [35 Stat. 1117][/us/stat/35/1117]).

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Changes were also made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2001—[Pub. L. 107–56][/us/pl/107/56] substituted “20 years” for “five years”.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
