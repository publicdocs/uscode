## § 441. Postal supply contracts

    No contract for furnishing supplies to the Postal Service shall be made with any person who has entered, or proposed to enter, into any combination to prevent the making of any bid for furnishing such supplies, or to fix a price or prices therefor, or who has made any agreement, or given or performed, or promised to give or perform, any consideration whatever to induce any other person not to bid for any such contract, or to bid at a specified price or prices thereon.

    Whoever violates this section shall be fined under this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the offender is a contractor for furnishing such supplies his contract may be annulled.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 704][/us/stat/62/704]; [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375], § 6(j)(4), Aug. 12, 1970, [84 Stat. 777][/us/stat/84/777]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 808 of title 39][/us/usc/t39/s808], U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Postal Service ([Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 389][/us/act/1912-08-24/ch389], § 2, [37 Stat. 553][/us/stat/37/553]).

    Minimum punishment provisions “less than $100 nor” and “less than three months nor” were omitted to conform to policy followed by codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code.

    Changes in phraseology were also made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $5,000” in second par., to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] struck out “Post Office Department or the” before “Postal Service”.

 __Effective Date of 1970 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375] effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service and published by it in the Federal Register, see [section 15(a) of Pub. L. 91–375][/us/pl/91/375/s15/a], set out as an Effective Date note preceding [section 101 of Title 39][/us/usc/t39/s101], Postal Service.
