## § 2152. Fortifications, harbor defenses, or defensive sea areas

    Whoever willfully trespasses upon, injures, or destroys any of the works or property or material of any submarine mine or torpedo or fortification or harbor-defense system owned or constructed or in process of construction by the United States; or

    Whoever willfully interferes with the operation or use of any such submarine mine, torpedo, fortification, or harbor-defense system; or

    Whoever knowingly, willfully, or wantonly violates any duly authorized and promulgated order or regulation of the President governing persons or vessels within the limits of defensive sea areas, which the President, for purposes of national defense, may from time to time establish by executive order—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 799][/us/stat/62/799]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 96 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 44][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s44], [35 Stat. 1097][/us/stat/35/1097]; [Mar. 4, 1917, ch. 180][/us/act/1917-03-04/ch180], [39 Stat. 1194][/us/stat/39/1194]; [May 22, 1917, ch. 20, § 19][/us/act/1917-05-22/ch20/s19], [40 Stat. 89][/us/stat/40/89]).

    Jurisdiction and venue provisions were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure providing for prosecution where the offense is committed, and [section 3238 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3238] providing that trial of offenses committed outside any district shall be in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first brought.

    Words “on conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage as punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is had.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.

 __Executive Order No. 10361__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 10361, June 12, 1952, 17 F.R. 5357, formerly set out under this section, which established the Whittier Defensive Sea Area, Alaska, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11549, July 28, 1970, 35 F.R. 12191.
