## § 498. Military or naval discharge certificates

    Whoever forges, counterfeits, or falsely alters any certificate of discharge from the military or naval service of the United States, or uses, unlawfully possesses or exhibits any such certificate, knowing the same to be forged, counterfeited, or falsely altered, shall be fined under this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 712][/us/stat/62/712]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940, ed., § 136 ([Mar. 4, 1917, ch. 180][/us/act/1917-03-04/ch180], [39 Stat. 1182][/us/stat/39/1182]).

    Reference to any person causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    At the end of this section words “in the discretion of the court” were omitted as unnecessary, as the punishment provisions, being framed in the alternative by the use of the disjunctive “or,” vest in the court the power to impose a fine or prison sentence in its discretion.

    Changes in phraseology were made.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $1,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
