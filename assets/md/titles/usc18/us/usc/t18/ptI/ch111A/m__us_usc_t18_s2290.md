## § 2290. Jurisdiction and scope

    (a)  __Jurisdiction__  __.—__

        (1) within the United States and within waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; or

        (2)

         outside United States and—

            (A) an offender or a victim is a national of the United States (as that term is defined under section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ([8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/22]);  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. There probably should be an additional closing parenthesis. </sup></sup> 

            (B) the activity involves a vessel in which a national of the United States was on board; or

            (C) the activity involves a vessel of the United States (as that term is defined under section 2  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1903).1

    (b)  __Scope__  __.—__

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 2 of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(2)(C), probably means section 3 of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, [Pub. L. 96–350][/us/pl/96/350], which was classified to section 1903 of former Title 46, Appendix, Shipping, and was repealed and restated in sections 70502 to 70506 of Title 46, Shipping, by [Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], §§ 10(2), 19, Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1683][/us/stat/120/1683], 1710. [Section 70502(b) of Title 46][/us/usc/t46/s70502/b] defines “vessel of the United States”.
