    (b) This section shall not apply to citizens or subjects of any country engaged in war with a country with which the United States is at war, unless such citizen or subject of such foreign country shall hire or solicit a citizen of the United States to enlist or go beyond the jurisdiction of the United States with intent to enlist or enter the service of a foreign country.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 745][/us/stat/62/745]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/H], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 22, 30 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], §§ 10, 18, [35 Stat. 1089][/us/stat/35/1089], 1091; [May 7, 1917, ch. 11][/us/act/1917-05-07/ch11], [40 Stat. 39][/us/stat/40/39]).

    Section consolidates said sections of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Last sentence of [section 30 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s30], U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to piracy and treason, was omitted as unnecessary.

    Words “within the United States” were substituted for “within the jurisdiction” etc., in view of the definition of United States in [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5].

    References in subsection (c) to sections 960 and 961 of this title are to the only other sections to which the subsection can apply.

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
