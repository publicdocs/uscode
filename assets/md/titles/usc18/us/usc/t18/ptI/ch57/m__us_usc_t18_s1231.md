([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 760][/us/stat/62/760]; [May 24, 1949, ch. 139][/us/act/1949-05-24/ch139], § 30, [63 Stat. 94][/us/stat/63/94]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 407a ([June 24, 1936, ch. 746][/us/act/1936-06-24/ch746], [49 Stat. 1899][/us/stat/49/1899]; [June 29, 1938, ch. 813][/us/act/1938-06-29/ch813], [52 Stat. 1242][/us/stat/52/1242]).

    Language designating offense as felony was omitted in uniformity with definitive [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1]. (See reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    Words “and shall, upon conviction” were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    Reference to persons aiding, abetting or causing was omitted as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement, but without change of substance.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This section \[section 30\] corrects a typographical error in [section 1231 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s1231], U.S.C.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in third par.

    1949—Act May 24, 1949, substituted “or travels in” for “in or travels” in second par.
