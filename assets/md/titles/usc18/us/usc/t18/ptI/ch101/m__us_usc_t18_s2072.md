## § 2072. False crop reports

    Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or any of its agencies, whose duties require the compilation or report of statistics or information relating to the products of the soil, knowingly compiles for issuance, or issues, any false statistics or information as a report of the United States or any of its agencies, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 795][/us/stat/62/795]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 215 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 124][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s124], [35 Stat. 1111][/us/stat/35/1111]).

    Words “or any of its agencies” were inserted after “United States” so as to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
