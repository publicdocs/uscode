## § 1264. Delivery to consignee

    Whoever, being an officer, agent, or employee of any railroad company, express company, or other common carrier, knowingly delivers to any person other than the person to whom it has been consigned, unless upon the written order in each instance of the bona fide consignee, or to any fictitious person, or to any person under a fictitious name, any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, which has been shipped into any place within the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 761][/us/stat/62/761]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/H], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 388 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 238][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s238], [35 Stat. 1136][/us/stat/35/1136]; [June 25, 1936, ch. 815, § 6][/us/act/1936-06-25/ch815/s6], [49 Stat. 1929][/us/stat/49/1929]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Words “Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” which appeared twice, were omitted. See [section 5 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s5] defining the “United States.”

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
