([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 717][/us/stat/62/717]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 109–177, title III, § 311(e)][/us/pl/109/177/s311/e], Mar. 9, 2006, [120 Stat. 242][/us/stat/120/242].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1598 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1598], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties ([June 17, 1930, ch. 497][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch497], title IV, § 598, [46 Stat. 752][/us/stat/46/752]; [June 25, 1938, ch. 679, § 26][/us/act/1938-06-25/ch679/s26], [52 Stat. 1089][/us/stat/52/1089]).

    Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    In view of definition of felony in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1] words “guilty of a felony” were omitted. (See reviser’s note under [section 550 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s550].)

    The punishment prescribed by [section 545 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s545] was inserted to make this section complete without reference to another section. In doing so it was necessary to rephrase the punishment provision of [section 545 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s545], as originally enacted, without change of substance.

    Forfeiture provision was omitted to conform with current administrative practice.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–177][/us/pl/109/177] substituted “10 years” for “two years” in last par.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.
