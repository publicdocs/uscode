## § 1853. Trees cut or injured

    Whoever unlawfully cuts, or wantonly injures or destroys any tree growing, standing, or being upon any land of the United States which, in pursuance of law, has been reserved or purchased by the United States for any public use, or upon any Indian reservation, or lands belonging to or occupied by any tribe of Indians under the authority of the United States, or any Indian allotment while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the Government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 787][/us/stat/62/787]; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI][/us/pl/104/294/tVI], § 601(a)(8), Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3498][/us/stat/110/3498].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 104 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], § 50, [35 Stat. 1098][/us/stat/35/1098]; [June 25, 1910, ch. 431][/us/act/1910-06-25/ch431], § 6, [36 Stat. 857][/us/stat/36/857]).

    Reference to persons aiding or procuring was deleted as unnecessary since such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Maximum fine was increased from $500 to $1,000 to conform to other comparable sections of this chapter. (See sections 1851 and 1852 of this title.)

    Minor changes were also made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–294][/us/pl/104/294] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
