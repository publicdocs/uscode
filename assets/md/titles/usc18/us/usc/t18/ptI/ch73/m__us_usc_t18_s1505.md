 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 241a, ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 135a][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s135a], as added [Jan. 13, 1940, ch. 1][/us/act/1940-01-13/ch1], [54 Stat. 13][/us/stat/54/13]; [June 8, 1945, ch. 178, § 2][/us/act/1945-06-08/ch178/s2], [59 Stat. 234][/us/stat/59/234]).

    Word “agency” was substituted for the words “independent establishment, board, commission” in two instances to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6].)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __References in Text__ 

    The Antitrust Civil Process Act, referred to in text, is [Pub. L. 87–664][/us/pl/87/664], Sept. 19, 1962, [76 Stat. 548][/us/stat/76/548], as amended, which is classified generally to chapter 34 (§ 1311 et seq.) of Title 15, Commerce and Trade.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–458][/us/pl/108/458], which directed amendment of the third undesignated paragraph of this section by substituting “be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both” for “be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both”, was executed by making the substitution for “be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.

    1976—[Pub. L. 94–435][/us/pl/94/435] struck out “[section 1968 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1968]” after “Antitrust Civil Process Act”, inserted “withholds, misrepresents” after “willfully”, “covers up” after “conceals”, “answers to written interrogatories, or oral testimony”, after “any documentary material”, and “or attempts to do so or solicits another to do so;” after “such demand”.

    1970—[Pub. L. 91–452][/us/pl/91/452] inserted reference to [section 1968 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1968].

    1962—[Pub. L. 87–664][/us/pl/87/664] substituted section catchline “Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees” for “Influencing or injuring witness before agencies and committees” and punished the willful removal, concealment, destruction, mutilation, alteration or falsification of documents which were the subject of a demand under the Antitrust Civil Process Act if done with the intent to prevent compliance with a civil investigative demand.

 __Effective Date of 1982 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 97–291][/us/pl/97/291] effective Oct. 12, 1982, see [section 9(a) of Pub. L. 97–291][/us/pl/97/291/s9/a], set out as an Effective Date note under [section 1512 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1512].
