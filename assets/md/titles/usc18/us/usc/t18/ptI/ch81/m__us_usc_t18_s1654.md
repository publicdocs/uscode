## § 1654. Arming or serving on privateers

    Whoever, being a citizen of the United States, without the limits thereof, fits out and arms, or attempts to fit out and arm or is concerned in furnishing, fitting out, or arming any private vessel of war or privateer, with intent that such vessel shall be employed to cruise or commit hostilities upon the citizens of the United States or their property; or

    Whoever takes the command of or enters on board of any such vessel with such intent; or

    Whoever purchases any interest in any such vessel with a view to share in the profits thereof—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 774][/us/stat/62/774]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/L], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 494 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 303][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s303], [35 Stat. 1147][/us/stat/35/1147]).

    Reference to persons procuring or aiding was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative.

    The last sentence relating to venue was omitted as unnecessary in view of the general provision to the same effect in [section 3238 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3238].

    Minor changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000” in last par.
