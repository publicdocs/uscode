## § 214. Offer for procurement of Federal Reserve bank loan and discount of commercial paper

    Whoever stipulates for or gives or receives, or consents or agrees to give or receive, any fee, commission, bonus, or thing of value for procuring or endeavoring to procure from any Federal Reserve bank any advance, loan, or extension of credit or discount or purchase of any obligation or commitment with respect thereto, either directly from such Federal Reserve bank or indirectly through any financing institution, unless such fee, commission, bonus, or thing of value and all material facts with respect to the arrangement or understanding therefor shall be disclosed in writing in the application or request for such advance, loan, extension of credit, discount, purchase, or commitment, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 695][/us/stat/62/695], § 214, formerly § 219; renumbered § 214, [Pub. L. 87–849, § 1(d)][/us/pl/87/849/s1/d], Oct. 23, 1962, [76 Stat. 1125][/us/stat/76/1125]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 599 of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s599], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ([Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, § 22(k)][/us/act/1913-12-23/ch6/s22/k], as added by [act June 19, 1934, ch. 653, § 3][/us/act/1934-06-19/ch653/s3], [48 Stat. 1108][/us/stat/48/1108]).

    Final sentence of said section 599, imposing civil liability on violators, was omitted as unnecessary, being merely a declaration of that rule of common law which in the absence of statute fixes civil liability on the wrongdoer.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior [section 214 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s214] was renumbered section 210.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
