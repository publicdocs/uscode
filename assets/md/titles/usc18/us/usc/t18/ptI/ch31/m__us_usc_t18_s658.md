 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on sections 1026(c) and 1514(d) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and [section 1138d(d) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1138d/d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking ([June 16, 1933, ch. 98][/us/act/1933-06-16/ch98], § 64, [48 Stat. 269][/us/stat/48/269]; [Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7][/us/act/1934-01-31/ch7], § 13, [48 Stat. 347][/us/stat/48/347]; [July 22, 1937, ch. 517][/us/act/1937-07-22/ch517], title IV, § 52(c), [50 Stat. 532][/us/stat/50/532]; [Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30][/us/act/1938-02-16/ch30], title V, § 514(d), [52 Stat. 76][/us/stat/52/76]; [Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964][/us/act/1946-08-14/ch964], § 3, [60 Stat. 1064][/us/stat/60/1064]).

    To avoid reference to another section the words “the Farm Credit Administration, any Federal intermediate credit bank, the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Farmers’ Home Corporation, or any production credit corporation or corporation in which a production credit corporation holds stock, any regional agricultural credit corporation, or any bank for cooperatives” were substituted for the words “or any corporation referred to in subsection (a) of this section.”

    The punishment provision was completely rewritten. The $2,000 fine of [section 1026(c) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1026/c], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the 2-year penalty of that section, [section 1514(d) of title 7][/us/usc/t7/s1514/d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and [section 1138(d) of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s1138/d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incongruous in juxtaposition with other sections of this chapter and were therefore increased to $5,000 and 5 years. (See sections 656 and 657 of this title.)

    The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser’s notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    \[Section 12\] conforms [section 658 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s658] U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy. (See note to sec. 11 \[of 1949 Act, set out in Legislative History note under [section 657 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s657]\]).
