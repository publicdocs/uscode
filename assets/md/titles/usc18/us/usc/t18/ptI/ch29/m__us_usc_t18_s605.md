## § 605. Disclosure of names of persons on relief

    Whoever, for political purposes, furnishes or discloses any list or names of persons receiving compensation, employment or benefits provided for or made possible by any Act of Congress appropriating, or authorizing the appropriation of funds for work relief or relief purposes, to a political candidate, committee, campaign manager, or to any person for delivery to a political candidate, committee, or campaign manager; and

    Whoever receives any such list or names for political purposes—

    Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 722][/us/stat/62/722]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 61e, 61g (Aug. 2, 1939, 11:50 a.m., E.S.T., ch. 410, §§ 6, 8, [53 Stat. 1148][/us/stat/53/1148]).

    This section consolidates sections 61e and 61g of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Reference to persons aiding or assisting, contained in words “or to aid or assist in furnishing or disclosing” was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
