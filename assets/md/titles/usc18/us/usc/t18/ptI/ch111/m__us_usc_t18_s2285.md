    (a)  __Offense__  __.—__ 

    Whoever knowingly operates, or attempts or conspires to operate, by any means, or embarks in any submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel that is without nationality and that is navigating or has navigated into, through, or from waters beyond the outer limit of the territorial sea of a single country or a lateral limit of that country’s territorial sea with an adjacent country, with the intent to evade detection, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.

    (e) __Affirmative Defenses.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for a violation of subsection (a), which the defendant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that the submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel involved was, at the time of the offense—

            (A) a vessel of the United States or lawfully registered in a foreign nation as claimed by the master or individual in charge of the vessel when requested to make a claim by an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law;

            (D) equipped with and using an operable automatic identification system, vessel monitoring system, or long range identification and tracking system.

        (2)  __Production of documents__  __.—__ 

        The affirmative defenses provided by this subsection are proved conclusively by the production of—

            (A) government documents evidencing the vessel’s nationality at the time of the offense, as provided in article 5 of the 1958 Convention on the High Seas;

            (B) a certificate of classification issued by the vessel’s classification society upon completion of relevant classification surveys and valid at the time of the offense; or

            (C) government documents evidencing licensure, regulation, or registration for commerce, research, or exploration.

    (f)  __Federal Activities Excepted__  __.—__ 

    Nothing in this section applies to lawfully authorized activities carried out by or at the direction of the United States Government.

    (g)  __Applicability of Other Provisions__  __.—__ 

    Sections 70504 and 70505 of title 46 apply to offenses under this section in the same manner as they apply to offenses under section 70503 of such title.

> “Congress finds and declares that operating or embarking in a submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel without nationality and on an international voyage is a serious international problem, facilitates transnational crime, including drug trafficking, and terrorism, and presents a specific threat to the safety of maritime navigation and the security of the United States.”
