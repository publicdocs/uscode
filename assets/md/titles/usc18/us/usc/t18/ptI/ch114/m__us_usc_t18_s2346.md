Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to abrogate or constitute a waiver of any sovereign immunity of a State or local government, or an Indian tribe against any unconsented lawsuit under this chapter, or otherwise to restrict, expand, or modify any sovereign immunity of a State or local government, or an Indian tribe.

        (3) The remedies under paragraphs (1) and (2) are in addition to any other remedies under Federal, State, local, or other law.
