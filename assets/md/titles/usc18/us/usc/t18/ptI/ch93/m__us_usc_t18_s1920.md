    The word “That” in the Act of Sept. 7, 1916, is omitted as unnecessary.

    The words “under [section 8106 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s8106]” are substituted for “under [section 754 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s754]” to reflect the codification of the section in title 5, United States Code. The words “a claim for compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5” are substituted for “any claim for compensation” for clarity.

    The words “or both” are substituted for “or by both such fine and imprisonment”.

    Minor changes in phraseology are made to conform to the style of title 18.
