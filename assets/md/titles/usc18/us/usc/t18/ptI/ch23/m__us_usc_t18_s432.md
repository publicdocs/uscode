([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 702][/us/stat/62/702]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(J)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/J], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 205 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 115][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s115], [35 Stat. 1109][/us/stat/35/1109]).
