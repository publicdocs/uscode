([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 721][/us/stat/62/721]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 61f, 61g (Aug. 2, 1939, 11:50 a.m., E.S.T., ch. 410. §§ 7, 8, [53 Stat. 1148][/us/stat/53/1148]).

    This section consolidates sections 61f and 61g of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.

    The punishment provision was derived from [section 61g of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s61g], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which, by reference, was made applicable to this section.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $1,000”.
