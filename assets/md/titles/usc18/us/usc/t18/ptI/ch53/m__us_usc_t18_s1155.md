## § 1155. Intoxicants dispensed on school site

    Whoever, on any tract of land in the former Indian country upon which is located any Indian school maintained by or under the supervision of the United States, manufactures, sells, gives away, or in any manner, or by any means furnishes to anyone, either for himself or another, any vinous, malt, or fermented liquors, or any other intoxicating drinks of any kind whatsoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, whether medicated or not, or who carries, or in any manner has carried, into such area any such liquors or drinks, or who shall be interested in such manufacture, sale, giving away, furnishing to anyone, or carrying into such area any of such liquors or drinks, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 758][/us/stat/62/758]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(1)(G), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on sections 241a, 244a, of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ([Mar. 1, 1895, ch. 145][/us/act/1895-03-01/ch145], § 8, [28 Stat. 697][/us/stat/28/697]; [Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43][/us/act/1934-03-05/ch43], [48 Stat. 396][/us/stat/48/396].)

    Section consolidates sections 241a and 244a of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The effect of section 244a of said title in repealing section 241a of said title, except as to lands upon which Indian schools are maintained, was to continue prohibiting the dispensing of liquor in such areas.

    The words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    The minimum punishment provision was omitted to conform to the policy adopted in revision of the 1909 Criminal Code.

    Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

    The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to [section 1262 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1262].

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $500”.
