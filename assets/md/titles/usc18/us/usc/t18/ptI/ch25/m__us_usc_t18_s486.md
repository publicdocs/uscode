## § 486. Uttering coins of gold, silver or other metal

    Whoever, except as authorized by law, makes or utters or passes, or attempts to utter or pass, any coins of gold or silver or other metal, or alloys of metals, intended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries, or of original design, shall be fined under this title  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See 1994 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 709][/us/stat/62/709]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(I)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/I], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 281 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 167][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321/s167], [35 Stat. 1120][/us/stat/35/1120]).

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322], which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $2,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $3,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
