## § 2381. Treason

    Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 807][/us/stat/62/807]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII][/us/pl/103/322/tXXXIII], § 330016(2)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2148][/us/stat/108/2148].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 1, 2 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], §§ 1, 2, [35 Stat. 1088][/us/stat/35/1088]).

    Section consolidates sections 1 and 2 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    The language referring to collection of the fine was omitted as obsolete and repugnant to the more humane policy of modern law which does not impose criminal consequences on the innocent.

    The words “every person so convicted of treason” were omitted as redundant.

    Minor change was made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] inserted “under this title but” before “not less than $10,000”.
