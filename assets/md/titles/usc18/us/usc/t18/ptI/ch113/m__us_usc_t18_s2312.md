([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 806][/us/stat/62/806]; [Pub. L. 102–519, title I, § 103][/us/pl/102/519/s103], Oct. 25, 1992, [106 Stat. 3385][/us/stat/106/3385]; [Pub. L. 109–177, title III, § 307(b)(2)(A)][/us/pl/109/177/s307/b/2/A], Mar. 9, 2006, [120 Stat. 240][/us/stat/120/240].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 408 ([Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89][/us/act/1919-10-29/ch89], §§ 1, 3, 5, [41 Stat. 324][/us/stat/41/324], 325; [Sept. 24, 1945, ch. 383][/us/act/1945-09-24/ch383], §§ 2, 3, [59 Stat. 536][/us/stat/59/536]).

    The first sentence of said section 408, providing the short title “An Act to punish the transportation of stolen motor vehicles or aircraft in interstate or foreign commerce,” and derived from section 1 of said act of October 29, 1919, as amended, was omitted as not appropriate in a revision.

    Definitions of “aircraft,” “motor vehicle,” and “interstate or foreign commerce,” which constituted the second sentence of said [section 408 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s408], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and were derived from section 2 of said act of October 29, 1919, as amended, are incorporated in sections 10 and 2311 of this title.

    Provision relating to receiving or selling stolen aircraft or motor vehicles, which was derived from [section 4 of the act of October 29, 1919][/us/act/1919-10-29/s4], as amended, is incorporated in [section 2313 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2313].

    Venue provision, which was derived from [section 5 of the act of October 29, 1919][/us/act/1919-10-29/s5], was omitted as unnecessary, being covered by [section 3237 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3237].

    Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–177][/us/pl/109/177] substituted “motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft” for “motor vehicle or aircraft”.

    1992—[Pub. L. 102–519][/us/pl/102/519] substituted “fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years” for “fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years”.
