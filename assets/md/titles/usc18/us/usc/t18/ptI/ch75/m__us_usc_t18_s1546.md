 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 220 of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s220], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality ([May 26, 1924, ch. 190][/us/act/1924-05-26/ch190], § 22, [43 Stat. 165][/us/stat/43/165]).

    Words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage since punishment can be imposed only after a conviction.

    Fine of $10,000 was reduced to $2,000 to conform with sections embracing offences of comparable gravity.

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.
