([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 716][/us/stat/62/716]; [Aug. 24, 1954, ch. 890, § 1][/us/act/1954-08-24/ch890/s1], [68 Stat. 782][/us/stat/68/782]; [Sept. 1, 1954, ch. 1213][/us/act/1954-09-01/ch1213], title V, § 507, [68 Stat. 1141][/us/stat/68/1141]; [June 30, 1955, ch. 258, § 2(c)][/us/act/1955-06-30/ch258/s2/c], [69 Stat. 242][/us/stat/69/242]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXII, § 320903(c)][/us/pl/103/322/s320903/c], title XXXIII, §§ 330004(18), 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2125][/us/stat/108/2125], 2142, 2147; [Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, § 604(b)(23)][/us/pl/104/294/s604/b/23], Oct. 11, 1996, [110 Stat. 3508][/us/stat/110/3508]; [Pub. L. 109–177, title III, § 310][/us/pl/109/177/s310], Mar. 9, 2006, [120 Stat. 242][/us/stat/120/242].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 1593 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1593], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties ([June 17, 1930, ch. 497][/us/act/1930-06-17/ch497], title IV, § 593, [46 Stat. 751][/us/stat/46/751]).

    Reference in first paragraph to aiders, contained in words “his, her, or their aiders and abettors” was omitted as unnecessary since such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2]. For the same reason words “or assists in so doing” in second paragraph were deleted.

    Words “shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,” in first paragraph were omitted in view of definition of misdemeanor in [section 1 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s1].

    Conviction provision in first paragraph reading “and on conviction thereof” was deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

    Minimum punishment provision “nor less than $50” in second paragraph was deleted.

    Forfeiture provision was rephrased to make it clear that forfeiture was not dependent upon conviction.

    The final paragraph was added to conform with [section 1709 of title 19][/us/usc/t19/s1709], U.S.C., 1940 ed.

    Changes were made in phraseology.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—[Pub. L. 109–177][/us/pl/109/177], which directed amendment of third par. by substituting “20 years” for “5 years”, was executed by making the substitution for “five years”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    [Pub. L. 103–322, § 330004(18)][/us/pl/103/322/s330004/18], as amended by [Pub. L. 104–294, § 604(b)(23)][/us/pl/104/294/s604/b/23], struck out “Philippine Islands,” before “Virgin Islands” in last par.

    [Pub. L. 103–322, § 320903(c)][/us/pl/103/322/s320903/c], inserted “or attempts to smuggle or clandestinely introduce” after “clandestinely introduces” in first par.
