([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 714][/us/stat/62/714]; [Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K)][/us/pl/103/322/s330016/1/K], Sept. 13, 1994, [108 Stat. 2147][/us/stat/108/2147]; [Pub. L. 104–208, div.

 __Historical and revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 131 ([June 15, 1917, ch. 30][/us/act/1917-06-15/ch30], title X, § 2, [40 Stat. 228][/us/stat/40/228]).

    Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by [section 2 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2].

    In view of definitions of department and agency in [section 6 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s6], words “department or agency” in first paragraph were substituted for “executive department, or any bureau, commission, or office”.

    Provision for 10 years’ imprisonment was reduced to 5 years to conform to punishment provision in [section 505 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s505], covering an offense of like gravity.

    Minor changes in phraseology were also made.

 __Codification__ 

    [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234] and [Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246] made identical amendments to this section. The amendments by [Pub. L. 110–234][/us/pl/110/234] were repealed by [section 4(a) of Pub. L. 110–246][/us/pl/110/246/s4/a].

 __Amendments__

    1996—[Pub. L. 104–208][/us/pl/104/208] reenacted section catchline without change and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:

    “Whoever falsely makes, forges, counterfeits, mutilates, or alters the seal of any department or agency of the United States; or

    “Whoever knowingly uses, affixes, or impresses any such fraudulently made, forged, counterfeited, mutilated, or altered seal to or upon any certificate, instrument, commission, document, or paper, of any description; or

    “Whoever, with fraudulent intent, possesses any such seal, knowing the same to have been so falsely made, forged, counterfeited, mutilated, or altered—

    “Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”

    1994—[Pub. L. 103–322][/us/pl/103/322] substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.
