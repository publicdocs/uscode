## § 3511. Judicial review of requests for information

    (a) The recipient of a request for records, a report, or other information under [section 2709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2709/b], section 626(a) or (b) or 627(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, section 1114(a)(5)(A) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, or section 802(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 may, in the United States district court for the district in which that person or entity does business or resides, petition for an order modifying or setting aside the request. The court may modify or set aside the request if compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful.

    (b) __Nondisclosure.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

            (A)  __Notice__  __.—__ 

            If a recipient of a request or order for a report, records, or other information under [section 2709 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2709], section 626 or 627 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ([15 U.S.C. 1681u][/us/usc/t15/s1681u] and 1681v), section 1114 of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 ([12 U.S.C. 3414][/us/usc/t12/s3414]), or section 802 of the National Security Act of 1947 ([50 U.S.C. 3162][/us/usc/t50/s3162]), wishes to have a court review a nondisclosure requirement imposed in connection with the request or order, the recipient may notify the Government or file a petition for judicial review in any court described in subsection (a).

            (B)  __Application__  __.—__ 

            Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of a notification under subparagraph (A), the Government shall apply for an order prohibiting the disclosure of the existence or contents of the relevant request or order. An application under this subparagraph may be filed in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the recipient of the order is doing business or in the district court of the United States for any judicial district within which the authorized investigation that is the basis for the request is being conducted. The applicable nondisclosure requirement shall remain in effect during the pendency of proceedings relating to the requirement.

            (C)  __Consideration__  __.—__ 

            A district court of the United States that receives a petition under subparagraph (A) or an application under subparagraph (B) should rule expeditiously, and shall, subject to paragraph (3), issue a nondisclosure order that includes conditions appropriate to the circumstances.

        (2)  __Application contents__  __.—__ 

        An application for a nondisclosure order or extension thereof or a response to a petition filed under paragraph (1) shall include a certification from the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a designee in a position not lower than Deputy Assistant Director at Bureau headquarters or a Special Agent in Charge in a Bureau field office designated by the Director, or in the case of a request by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government other than the Department of Justice, the head or deputy head of the department, agency, or instrumentality, containing a statement of specific facts indicating that the absence of a prohibition of disclosure under this subsection may result in—

            (A) a danger to the national security of the United States;

            (B) interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation;

            (C) interference with diplomatic relations; or

            (D) danger to the life or physical safety of any person.

        (3)  __Standard__  __.—__ 

        A district court of the United States shall issue a nondisclosure order or extension thereof under this subsection if the court determines that there is reason to believe that disclosure of the information subject to the nondisclosure requirement during the applicable time period may result in—

            (A) a danger to the national security of the United States;

            (B) interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation;

            (C) interference with diplomatic relations; or

            (D) danger to the life or physical safety of any person.

    (c) In the case of a failure to comply with a request for records, a report, or other information made to any person or entity under [section 2709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2709/b], section 626(a) or (b) or 627(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, section 1114(a)(5)(A) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, or section 802(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction in which the investigation is carried on or the person or entity resides, carries on business, or may be found, to compel compliance with the request. The court may issue an order requiring the person or entity to comply with the request. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt thereof. Any process under this section may be served in any judicial district in which the person or entity may be found.

    (d) In all proceedings under this section, subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent an unauthorized disclosure of a request for records, a report, or other information made to any person or entity under [section 2709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2709/b], section 626(a) or (b) or 627(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, section 1114(a)(5)(A) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, or section 802(a) of the National Security Act of 1947. Petitions, filings, records, orders, and subpoenas must also be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a request for records, a report, or other information made to any person or entity under [section 2709(b) of this title][/us/usc/t18/s2709/b], section 626(a) or (b) or 627(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, section 1114(a)(5)(A) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, or section 802(a) of the National Security Act of 1947.

    (e) In all proceedings under this section, the court shall, upon request of the government, review ex parte and in camera any government submission or portions thereof, which may include classified information.
