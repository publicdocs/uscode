## § 3621. Imprisonment of a convicted person

    (a)  __Commitment to Custody of Bureau of Prisons__  __.—__ 

    A person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of subchapter D of chapter 227 shall be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons until the expiration of the term imposed, or until earlier released for satisfactory behavior pursuant to the provisions of section 3624.

    (b)  __Place of Imprisonment__  __.—__ 

    The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the prisoner’s imprisonment. The Bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum standards of health and habitability established by the Bureau, whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise and whether within or without the judicial district in which the person was convicted, that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable, considering—

        (1) the resources of the facility contemplated;

        (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense;

        (3) the history and characteristics of the prisoner;

        (4)

         any statement by the court that imposed the sentence—

            (A) concerning the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was determined to be warranted; or

            (B) recommending a type of penal or correctional facility as appropriate; and

        (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to [section 994(a)(2) of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s994/a/2].

        In designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under this subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high social or economic status. The Bureau may at any time, having regard for the same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another. The Bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse. Any order, recommendation, or request by a sentencing court that a convicted person serve a term of imprisonment in a community corrections facility shall have no binding effect on the authority of the Bureau under this section to determine or change the place of imprisonment of that person.

    (c)  __Delivery of Order of Commitment__  __.—__ 

    When a prisoner, pursuant to a court order, is placed in the custody of a person in charge of a penal or correctional facility, a copy of the order shall be delivered to such person as evidence of this authority to hold the prisoner, and the original order, with the return endorsed thereon, shall be returned to the court that issued it.

    (d)  __Delivery of Prisoner for Court Appearances__  __.—__ 

    The United States marshal shall, without charge, bring a prisoner into court or return him to a prison facility on order of a court of the United States or on written request of an attorney for the Government.

    (e) __Substance Abuse Treatment.—__ 

        (1)  __Phase-in__  __.—__ 

        In order to carry out the requirement of the last sentence of subsection (b) of this section, that every prisoner with a substance abuse problem have the opportunity to participate in appropriate substance abuse treatment, the Bureau of Prisons shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, provide residential substance abuse treatment (and make arrangements for appropriate aftercare)—

            (A) for not less than 50 percent of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1995, with priority for such treatment accorded based on an eligible prisoner’s proximity to release date;

            (B) for not less than 75 percent of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1996, with priority for such treatment accorded based on an eligible prisoner’s proximity to release date; and

            (C) for all eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1997 and thereafter, with priority for such treatment accorded based on an eligible prisoner’s proximity to release date.

        (2) __Incentive for prisoners’ successful completion of treatment program.—__ 

            (A)  __Generally__  __.—__ 

            Any prisoner who, in the judgment of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, has successfully completed a program of residential substance abuse treatment provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall remain in the custody of the Bureau under such conditions as the Bureau deems appropriate. If the conditions of confinement are different from those the prisoner would have experienced absent the successful completion of the treatment, the Bureau shall periodically test the prisoner for substance abuse and discontinue such conditions on determining that substance abuse has recurred.

            (B)  __Period of custody__  __.—__ 

            The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.

        (3)  __Report__  __.—__ 

        The Bureau of Prisons shall transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives on January 1, 1995, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, a report. Such report shall contain—

            (A) a detailed quantitative and qualitative description of each substance abuse treatment program, residential or not, operated by the Bureau;

            (B) a full explanation of how eligibility for such programs is determined, with complete information on what proportion of prisoners with substance abuse problems are eligible; and

            (C) a complete statement of to what extent the Bureau has achieved compliance with the requirements of this title.

        (4)  __Authorization of appropriations__  __.—__ 

        There are authorized to carry out this subsection such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.

        (5)  __Definitions__  __.—__
