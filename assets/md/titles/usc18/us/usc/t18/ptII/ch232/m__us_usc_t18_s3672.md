 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

 __1948__  __Act__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 728 ([Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 521, § 4(a)][/us/act/1925-03-04/ch521/s4/a], as added [June 6, 1930, ch. 406, § 2][/us/act/1930-06-06/ch406/s2], [46 Stat. 503][/us/stat/46/503]).

    The only change made in this section was the substitution of the “Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts” for “Attorney General”. (See reviser’s note under [section 3654 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3654].)

 __1949__  __Act__ 

    This amendment \[see section 57\] conforms the language of [section 3656 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s3656], U.S.C., to that of title 28, U.S.C., section 604(a).

 __References in Text__ 

    Section 2 of the Public Health Service Act, referred to in the seventh undesignated par., is classified to [section 201 of Title 42][/us/usc/t42/s201], The Public Health and Welfare.

This Act, referred to in the seventh undesignated par., probably means [Pub. L. 110–199][/us/pl/110/199], Apr. 9, 2008, [122 Stat. 657][/us/stat/122/657], known as the Second Chance Act of 2007: Community Safety Through Recidivism Prevention and also as the Second Chance Act of 2007.
