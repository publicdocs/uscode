## § 3194. Transportation of fugitive by receiving agent

    Any agent appointed as provided in [section 3182 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3182] who receives the fugitive into his custody is empowered to transport him to the State or Territory from which he has fled.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 825][/us/stat/62/825].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 663 (R.S. § 5279).

    Last sentence of said section 663, relating to rescue of such fugitive, was omitted as covered by [section 752 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s752], the punishment provision of which is based on later statutes. (See reviser’s note under that section.)

    Minor changes were made in phraseology.
