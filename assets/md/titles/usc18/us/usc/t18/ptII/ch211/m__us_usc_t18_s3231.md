## § 3231. District courts

    The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 826][/us/stat/62/826].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 588d of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s588d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking; title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 546, 547 ([Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321][/us/act/1909-03-04/ch321], §§ 326, 340, [35 Stat. 1151][/us/stat/35/1151], 1153; [Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 291][/us/act/1911-03-03/ch231/s291], [36 Stat. 1167][/us/stat/36/1167]; [May 18, 1934, ch. 304, § 4][/us/act/1934-05-18/ch304/s4], [48 Stat. 783][/us/stat/48/783]).

    This section was formed by combining sections 546 and 547 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with [section 588d of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s588d], U.S.C., Banks and Banking, with no change of substance.

    The language of said [section 588d of title 12][/us/usc/t12/s588d], U.S.C., 1940 ed., which related to bank robbery, or killing or kidnapping as an incident thereto (see section 2113, of this title), and which read “Jurisdiction over any offense defined by sections 588b and 588c of this title shall not be reserved exclusively to courts of the United States” was omitted as adequately covered by this section.
