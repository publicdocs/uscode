## § 3055. Officers’ powers to suppress Indian liquor traffic

    The chief special officer for the suppression of the liquor traffic among Indians and duly authorized officers working under his supervision whose appointments are made or affirmed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs or the Secretary of the Interior may execute all warrants of arrest and other lawful precepts issued under the authority of the United States and in the execution of his duty he may command all necessary assistance.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 817][/us/stat/62/817].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 250 of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s250], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ([Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 388][/us/act/1912-08-24/ch388], § 1, [37 Stat. 519][/us/stat/37/519]).

    The only change was to delete the words at the beginning of the section, “The powers conferred by [section 504 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s504] upon marshals and their deputies are conferred upon.” and the addition, at the end of the section, of the phrase expressing such powers beginning with the words “may execute all warrants”.
