## § 3243. Jurisdiction of State of Kansas over offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations

    Jurisdiction is conferred on the State of Kansas over offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations, including trust or restricted allotments, within the State of Kansas, to the same extent as its courts have jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State in accordance with the laws of the State.

    This section shall not deprive the courts of the United States of jurisdiction over offenses defined by the laws of the United States committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 827][/us/stat/62/827].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 217a of title 25][/us/usc/t25/s217a], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians ([June 8, 1940, ch. 276][/us/act/1940-06-08/ch276], [54 Stat. 249][/us/stat/54/249]).

    The attention of Congress is directed to consideration of the question whether this section should be broadened and made applicable to all states rather than only to Kansas. Such change was not regarded as within the scope of this revision.

    Changes were made in phraseology.
