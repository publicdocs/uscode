L. 87–299, § 1][/us/pl/87/299/s1], Sept. 26, 1961, [75 Stat. 648][/us/stat/75/648]; [Pub. L. 108–21, title VI, § 610(a)][/us/pl/108/21/s610/a], Apr. 30, 2003, [117 Stat. 692][/us/stat/117/692].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on [section 746(g) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s746/g], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, and on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 582 (R.S. § 1044; [Apr. 13, 1876, ch. 56][/us/act/1876-04-13/ch56], [19 Stat. 32][/us/stat/19/32]; [Nov. 17, 1921, ch. 124, § 1][/us/act/1921-11-17/ch124/s1], [42 Stat. 220][/us/stat/42/220]; [Dec. 27, 1927, ch. 6][/us/act/1927-12-27/ch6], [45 Stat. 51][/us/stat/45/51]; [Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876][/us/act/1940-10-14/ch876], title I, subchap. III, § 346(g), [54 Stat. 1167][/us/stat/54/1167]).

    [Section 582 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s582], U.S.C., 1940 ed., and [section 746(g) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s746/g], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, were consolidated. “Except as otherwise expressly provided by law” was inserted to avoid enumeration of exceptive provisions.

    The proviso contained in the act of 1927 “That nothing herein contained shall apply to any offense for which an indictment has been heretofore found or an information instituted, or to any proceedings under any such indictment or information,” was omitted as no longer necessary.

    In the consolidation of these sections the 5-year period of limitation for violations of the Nationality Code, provided for in said [section 746(g) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s746/g], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, is reduced to 3 years. There seemed no sound basis for considering 3 years adequate in the case of heinous felonies and gross frauds against the United States but inadequate for misuse of a passport or false statement to a naturalization examiner.

 __Amendments__ 

    2003—[Pub. L. 108–21][/us/pl/108/21] designated existing provisions as subsec. (a), inserted heading, and added subsec. (b).

    1954—Act Sept. 1, 1954, changed the limitation period from three years to five years.

 __Effective Date of 1954 Amendment__ 

[Act Sept. 1, 1954, ch. 1214, § 12(b)][/us/act/1954-09-01/ch1214/s12/b], formerly section 10(b), [68 Stat. 1145][/us/stat/68/1145], as renumbered by [Pub. L. 87–299, § 1][/us/pl/87/299/s1], Sept. 26, 1961, [75 Stat. 648][/us/stat/75/648], provided that: 

> “The amendment made by subsection (a) \[amending this section\] shall be effective with respect to offenses (1) committed on or after September 1, 1954, or (2) committed prior to such date, if on such date prosecution therefor is not barred by provisions of law in effect prior to such date.”

 __Fugitives From Justice__ 

    Statutes of limitations as not extending to persons fleeing from justice, see [section 3290 of this title][/us/usc/t18/s3290].

 __Offenses Against Internal Security__ 

    Limitation period in connection with offenses against internal security, see [section 783 of Title 50][/us/usc/t50/s783], War and National Defense.

 __Sections 792, 793, and 794 of This Title; Limitation Period__ 

    Limitation period in connection with sections 792, 793, and 794 of this title, see note set out under section 792.
