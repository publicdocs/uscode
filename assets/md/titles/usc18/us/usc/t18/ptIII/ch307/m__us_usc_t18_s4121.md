 __Amendments__ 

    1949—Act May 24, 1949, made a representative of the Secretary of Defense a member of the board of directors.

    Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (together with its Board of Directors), and its functions transferred to Department of Justice to be administered under general direction and supervision of Attorney General, by Reorg.

>     “(a) __In General.—__

>          A Federal prisoner may be excused from the requirement to work only as necessitated by—

>             “(A) security considerations;

>             “(B) disciplinary action;

>         “(1) a plan to assure the closure of the United States Penitentiary on McNeil Island, Steilacoom, Washington, on or before January 1, 1982; and

>         “(2) a report on the status of the Federal Prison Industries.
