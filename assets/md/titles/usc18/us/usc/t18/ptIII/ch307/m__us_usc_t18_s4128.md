## § 4128. Enforcement by Attorney General

    In the event of any failure of Federal Prison Industries to act, the Attorney General shall not be limited in carrying out the duties conferred upon him by law.

([June 25, 1948, ch. 645][/us/act/1948-06-25/ch645], [62 Stat. 853][/us/stat/62/853].)

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 744n ([June 23, 1934, ch. 736][/us/act/1934-06-23/ch736], § 6, [48 Stat. 1212][/us/stat/48/1212]).

    Phrase relating to section being “supplemental” to sections 744i–744h of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is omitted as unnecessary.

    Retention of remainder of section is essential to insure authority of Attorney General to require performance of duties of Prison Industries. (See sections 4001 and 4003 of this title.) This is also consistent with 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, § 3(a), transferring the corporation to the Department of Justice “under the general direction and supervision of the Attorney General”. (See [section 133t of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s133t], U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.)

    Words “Federal Prison Industries” were substituted for “the corporation”.
