    (f)

        (1) The term “years of service” shall mean the number of years an individual as an employee shall have rendered service to one or more employers for compensation or received remuneration for time lost, and shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of [section 231b(i) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231b/i]. Twelve calendar months, consecutive or otherwise, in each of which an employee has rendered such service or received such wages for time lost, shall constitute a year of service. Ultimate fractions shall be taken at their actual value.

        (2)

         Where service prior to August 29, 1935, may be included in the computation of years of service as provided in subdivision (3) of [section 231b(i) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231b/i], it may be included as to—

            (iii) service rendered to a person not an employer in the performance of operations involving the use of standard railroad equipment if such operations were performed by an employer on August 29, 1935.

    (h)

        (1) The term “compensation” means any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee to one or more employers or as an employee representative, including remuneration paid for time lost as an employee, but remuneration paid for time lost shall be deemed earned in the month in which such time is lost. A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer’s payroll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is made. Compensation earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946 but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of the next succeeding calendar year or if the employee establishes, subject to the provisions of [section 231h of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231h], the period during which such compensation will have been earned.

        (2) An employee shall be deemed to be paid “for time lost” the amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable period of absence from the active service of the employer, including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost.

        (3) Solely for purposes of determining amounts to be included in the compensation of an employee, the term “compensation” shall also include cash tips received by an employee in any calendar month in the course of his employment by an employer unless the amount of such cash tips is less than $20.

        (4) Tips included as compensation by reason of the provisions of subdivision (3) shall be deemed to be paid at the time a written statement including such tips is furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \[[26 U.S.C. 6053(a)][/us/usc/t26/s6053/a]\] or, if no statement including such tips is so furnished, at the time received. Tips so deemed to be paid in any month shall be deemed paid for services rendered in such month.

        (5)

         In determining compensation, there shall be attributable as compensation paid to an employee in calendar months in which he is in military service creditable under [section 231b(i)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231b/i/2], in addition to any other compensation paid to him with respect to such months—

            (i) for each such calendar month prior to 1968, $160;

            (ii) for each such calendar month after 1967 and prior to 1975, $260; and

            (iii) for each such calendar month after 1974, the amount which is creditable as such individual’s “wages” under section 209(d) of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 409(d)][/us/usc/t42/s409/d]\].

        (6)

         Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding subdivisions of this subsection, the term “compensation” shall not include—

            (i) tips, except as is provided under subdivision (3) of this subsection;

            (ii) remuneration for service which is performed by a non-resident alien individual for the period he is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) or (J) of [section 1101(a)(15) of title 8][/us/usc/t8/s1101/a/15], as amended, and which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in subparagraph (F) or (J), as the case may be;

            (iii) remuneration earned in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer with respect to any calendar month in which the amount of such remuneration is less than $25;

            (iv) remuneration for service as a delegate to a national or international convention of a railway-labor-organization employer if the individual rendering such service has not previously rendered service, other than as such a delegate, which may be included in his “years of service;”

            (v) the amount of any payment (including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for any such payment) made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan or system established by an employer which makes provision for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), on account of sickness or accident disability or medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability; and

            (vi) an amount paid specifically—either as an advance, as reimbursement or allowance—for traveling or other bona fide and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer provided any such payment is identified by the employer either by a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense reimbursement or allowance are combined in a single payment.

        (7) The term “compensation” includes any separation allowance or subsistence allowance paid under any benefit schedule provided under section 701 of title VII of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 \[[45 U.S.C. 797][/us/usc/t45/s797]\]  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  and any termination allowance paid under section 702 of that Act \[[45 U.S.C. 797a][/us/usc/t45/s797a]\], but does not include any other benefits payable under that title \[[45 U.S.C. 797][/us/usc/t45/s797] et seq.\]. The total amount of any subsistence allowance paid under a benefit schedule provided pursuant to section 701 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 shall be considered as having been earned in the month in which the employee first timely filed a claim for such an allowance.

        (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, for the purposes of sections 231b(a)(1), 231c(a)(1), and 231c(f)(1) of this title, the term “compensation” includes any payment from any source to an employee or employee representative if such payment is subject to tax under section 3201 or 3211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \[[26 U.S.C. 3201][/us/usc/t26/s3201], 3211\].

    (o) An individual shall be deemed to have “a current connection with the railroad industry” at the time an annuity begins to accrue to him and at death if, in any thirty consecutive calendar months before the month in which an annuity under this subchapter begins to accrue to him, or the month in which he dies if that first occurs, he will have been in service as an employee in not less than twelve calendar months and, if such thirty calendar months do not immediately precede such month, he will not have been engaged in any regular employment other than employment for an employer or employment with the Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, the National Mediation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board, the State-owned railroad (as defined in the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 \[[45 U.S.C. 1201][/us/usc/t45/s1201] et seq.\]), so long as it is an instrumentality of the State of Alaska, or the Railroad Retirement Board in the period before such month and after the end of such thirty months. For purposes of [section 231a(b) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/b] and [section 231a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/d] only, an individual shall be deemed also to have “a current connection with the railroad industry” if, after having completed twenty-five years of service, such individual involuntarily and without fault ceased rendering service as an employee under this subchapter and did not thereafter decline an offer of employment in the same class or craft as the individual’s most recent employee service. For purposes of [section 231a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/d] only, an individual shall be deemed to have a “current connection with the railroad industry” if a pension will have been payable to that individual under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 \[[45 U.S.C. 228a][/us/usc/t45/s228a] et seq.\] or a retirement annuity based on service of not less than 10 years (as computed in awarding the annuity) will have begun to accrue to that individual prior to 1948 under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937. For the purposes of [section 231a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/d] only, an individual shall be deemed also to have a “current connection with the railroad industry” if he will have completed ten years of service and (A) he would be neither fully nor currently insured under the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 301][/us/usc/t42/s301] et seq.\] if his service as an employee after December 31, 1936, were included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act, or (B) he has no quarters of coverage under the Social Security Act.
