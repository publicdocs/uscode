    (2)

     if there are sufficient reserves in the Railroad Retirement Account, whether—

        (A) the rates of such taxes should be reduced, or

([Pub. L. 98–76, title V, § 502][/us/pl/98/76/s502], Aug. 12, 1983, [97 Stat. 440][/us/stat/97/440]; [Pub. L. 99–514, § 2][/us/pl/99/514/s2], Oct. 22, 1986, [100 Stat. 2095][/us/stat/100/2095]; [Pub. L. 104–66, title II, § 2221(a)][/us/pl/104/66/s2221/a], Dec. 21, 1995, [109 Stat. 733][/us/stat/109/733].)

 __Codification__ 

    Section was enacted as part of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983, and not as part of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 which comprises this subchapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1995—[Pub. L. 104–66][/us/pl/104/66] which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “As part of the annual report required under [section 231u(a) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231u/a]” for “On or before July 1, 1985, and each calendar year thereafter”, was executed by making the substitution for “On or before July 1 of 1985, and of each calendar year thereafter”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    1986—Par. (1). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”.
