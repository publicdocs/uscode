        (2) This section shall not operate to prohibit the characterization or treatment of that portion of an annuity under this subchapter which is not computed under section 231b(a), 231c(a), or 231c(f) of this title, or any portion of a supplemental annuity under this subchapter, as community property for the purposes of, or property subject to, distribution in accordance with a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or the terms of any court-approved property settlement incident to any such court decree. The Board shall make payments of such portions in accordance with any such characterization or treatment or any such decree or settlement.

        (3)

            (A)

             Payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not require that the employee be entitled to an annuity under [section 231a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/a/1]: Provided, however, That where an employee is not entitled to such an annuity, payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) may not begin before the month in which the following three conditions are satisfied:

            (C) If the employee is not entitled to an annuity under [section 231a(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s231a/a/1], payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be computed as though the employee were entitled to an annuity.
