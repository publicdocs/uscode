## § 1302. Purposes

    The purposes of this chapter are to transfer the interest of the United States in the common stock of the Corporation to the private sector in a manner that provides for the long-term viability of the Corporation, provides for the continuation by the Corporation of its rail service in the Northeast and Midwest, provides for the protection of the public interest in a sound rail transportation system, and, to the extent not inconsistent with such purposes, secures the maximum proceeds to the United States.
