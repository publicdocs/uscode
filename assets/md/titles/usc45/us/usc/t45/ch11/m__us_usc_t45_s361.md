        The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act \[[42 U.S.C. 1104][/us/usc/t42/s1104]\] an account to be known as the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund. This unemployment insurance administration fund shall consist of (i) such part of all contributions collected pursuant to [section 358 of this title][/us/usc/t45/s358] as equals 0.65 per centum of the total compensation on which such contributions are based; (ii) all amounts advanced to the fund by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section; (iii) all amounts appropriated by subsection (b) of this section; and (iv) such additional amounts as Congress may appropriate for expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter. Such additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated.

    (b) __Authorization of appropriations; advance of sums; repayment__ 

        In addition to the other moneys herein provided for expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter, there is appropriated to the fund such amount as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate to have been collected or to be collectible with respect to the calendar years 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939, from employers subject to this chapter, under title IX of the Social Security Act, less such amount as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate will be appropriated or has been appropriated to States or Territories pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 24, 1937 (Public, Numbered 353, Seventy-fifth Congress), as proceeds of taxes paid by employers pursuant to title IX of the Social Security Act.

        Until the amount appropriated by this subsection is credited to the fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to advance to the credit of the fund such sums, but not more than $2,000,000, as the Board requests for the purpose of financing the costs of administering this chapter. Such advance shall be repaid from the fund at such time after the amount appropriated by this subsection is credited to the fund as the Board by agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, but not later than January 1, 1940.

    (c) __Availability for administrative expenses__
