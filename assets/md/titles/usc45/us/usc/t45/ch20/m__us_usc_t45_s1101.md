## § 1101. Congressional findings and declarations

    The Congress finds and declares that—

    (1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 \[[45 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t45/s701] et seq.\] have failed to create a self-sustaining railroad system in the Northeast region of the United States and have cost United States taxpayers many billions of dollars over original estimates;

    (2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of the public and the needs of national security;

    (3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention to preserve essential rail service in the private sector;

    (4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 \[[45 U.S.C. 701][/us/usc/t45/s701] et seq.\] have resulted in the payment of benefits far in excess of levels anticipated at the time of enactment, have imposed an excessive fiscal burden on the Federal taxpayer, and are now an obstacle to the establishment of improved rail service and continued rail employment in the Northeast region of the United States; and

    (5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee protection system must be developed and funded.
