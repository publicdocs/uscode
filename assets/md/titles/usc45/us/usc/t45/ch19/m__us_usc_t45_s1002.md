 __References in Text__ 

    This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this title”, meaning title I (§ 101 et seq.) of [Pub. L. 96–254][/us/pl/96/254], May 30, 1980, [94 Stat. 399][/us/stat/94/399], as amended, known as the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act, which is classified principally to this chapter.

 __Amendments__ 

    1980—Par. (5). [Pub. L. 96–448][/us/pl/96/448] inserted “, the estate of such Company in its reorganization proceeding, or the trustee appointed in such proceeding” after “Railroad Company”. The amendment was executed by inserting amendatory text preceding the semicolon instead of the period at end of par. (5) as directed to reflect the probable intent of Congress, in view of par. (5) being enacted without a closing period.
