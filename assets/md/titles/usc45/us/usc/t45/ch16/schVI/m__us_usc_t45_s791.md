        (2) The antitrust laws are inapplicable with respect to any action taken to formulate or implement the final system plan where such action was in compliance with the requirements of such plan and with respect to any action taken to formulate or implement any supplemental transaction.

        (3) As used in this subsection, “antitrust laws” includes the Act of July 2, 1890 (ch. 647, [26 Stat. 209][/us/stat/26/209]), as amended; the Act of October 15, 1914 (ch. 323, [38 Stat. 730][/us/stat/38/730]), as amended; the Federal Trade Commission Act ([38 Stat. 717][/us/stat/38/717]), as amended \[[15 U.S.C. 41][/us/usc/t15/s41] et seq.\], sections 73 and 74 of the Act of August 27, 1894 ([28 Stat. 570][/us/stat/28/570]), as amended \[[15 U.S.C. 8][/us/usc/t15/s8], 9\]; the Act of June 19, 1936 (ch. 592, [49 Stat. 1526][/us/stat/49/1526]), as amended; and the antitrust laws of any State or subdivision thereof.

    (b) __Commerce, securities, and bankruptcy__ 

        (1) The provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 and the Bankruptcy Act, are inapplicable (A) to actions taken under this chapter to formulate and implement the final system plan where such action was in compliance with the requirements of such plan, and (B) to actions taken under this chapter to formulate or implement any supplemental transaction.

        (2) All securities of the Corporation which are issued to the Association as the initial holder, or which are issued in connection with the transfer to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof of rail properties under this chapter, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been issued subject to and authorized pursuant to section 11301  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 49.

        (3) The provisions of [section 77e of title 15][/us/usc/t15/s77e], shall not apply to transactions involving the issuance of any security of the Corporation to the Association, transactions involving the issuance of any security of the Corporation that is deposited with the special court pursuant to [section 743(a) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s743/a], or transactions involving the issuance or distribution of any security of the Corporation, where the terms and conditions of such issuance or distribution are approved by the special court pursuant to [section 743(c) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s743/c].

The powers and duties of the Commission under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act shall also so terminate, as of February 5, 1976, with respect to any railroad in reorganization under such section 77 but not subject to this chapter which (1) does not operate any line of railroad, and (2) has transferred all or substantially all of its rail properties to a railroad in reorganization in the region which was subject to this chapter prior to February 5, 1976. Thereafter, such powers and duties of the Commission shall be vested in the district court of the United States which has jurisdiction of the estate of any such railroad in reorganization at the time of such conveyance. Such court shall proceed to reorganize or liquidate such railroad in reorganization pursuant to such section 77 on such terms as the court deems just and reasonable, or pursuant to any other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, if the court finds that such action would be in the best interests of such estate. This paragraph does not affect any obligation of any carrier by railroad subject to regulation under subtitle IV of title 49.
