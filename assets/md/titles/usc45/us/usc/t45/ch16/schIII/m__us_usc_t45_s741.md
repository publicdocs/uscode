    (c) __Incorporators__ 

        (1) The members of the executive committee of the Association shall be the incorporators of the Corporation and shall take whatever steps are necessary to establish the Corporation, including the filing of articles of incorporation.

        (2) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, after February 5, 1976, the members of the executive committee of the Association (including duly authorized representatives of members who are authorized by this chapter to be represented) and the chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the Corporation shall adopt the bylaws of the Corporation and serve as the Board of Directors of the Corporation until all members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have been selected in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The chief executive officer shall serve as chairman of such Board until a chairman thereof is selected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, after which time such chairman shall serve at the pleasure of such Board.

    (d) __Board of Directors__

            (B) three individuals selected by the holders of the Corporation’s series B preferred stock; and

            (C) two individuals selected by the holders of the Corporation’s common stock.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of State or Federal law, the series B preferred stock and common stock shall have terms and conditions not inconsistent with the final system plan. As a condition of its investment in the Corporation, the Association may require that the Corporation adopt limitations consistent with the final system plan on the circumstances under which dividends on the series B preferred stock and common stock are payable so long as any of the debentures or series A preferred stock are outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the final system plan, the initial authorized number of shares of series B preferred stock may be 35,000,000, and the Corporation may issue initially for the purpose of the deposit required under [section 743(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t45/s743/a/1] such numbers of shares of series B preferred and common stock as the Association shall certify to the Special Court pursuant to section 719(c)(1)(3)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

Within 30 days after such appointment, such voting trustees shall select members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation on behalf of the holders of the class of securities whose rights they exercise pursuant to this subsection.

    (h) __Annual report__ 

        The Corporation shall transmit to the Congress and the President, not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, a comprehensive and detailed report on all activities and accomplishments of the Corporation during the preceding fiscal year.

    (i) __Liability of directors__ 

        No director of the Corporation shall be liable, for money damages or otherwise, to any party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, if, with respect to the subject matter of the action, suit, or proceeding, such person was fulfilling a duty which he in good faith reasonably believed to be required by law or vested in him in his capacity as a director of the Association or as an officer of the United States. The United States shall indemnify such person against all judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and costs and expenses (including fees of accountants, experts, and attorneys), actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding in which such person is determined to have met such standard of conduct.
