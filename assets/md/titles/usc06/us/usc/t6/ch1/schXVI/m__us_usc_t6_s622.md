            (A)

             identify—

                (i) chemical facilities of interest; and

    (b) __Security measures__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            A facility, in developing a site security plan as required under subsection (a), shall include security measures that, in combination, appropriately address the security vulnerability assessment and the risk-based performance standards for security for the facility.

        (2) __Employee input__ 

            To the greatest extent practicable, a facility’s security vulnerability assessment and site security plan shall include input from at least 1 facility employee and, where applicable, 1 employee representative from the bargaining agent at that facility, each of whom possesses, in the determination of the facility’s security officer, relevant knowledge, experience, training, or education as pertains to matters of site security.

    (c) __Approval or disapproval of site security plans__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Review__ 

                Except as provided in paragraph (4), the Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove each site security plan submitted pursuant to subsection (a).

                    If the requirements of an alternative security program do not meet the requirements under this section, the Secretary may recommend additional security measures to the program that will enable the Secretary to approve the program.

            (B) __Satisfaction of site security plan requirement__ 

            A covered chemical facility may satisfy the site security plan requirement under subsection (a) by adopting an alternative security program that the Secretary has—

                (i) reviewed and approved under subparagraph (A); and

                (ii) determined to be appropriate for the operations and security concerns of the covered chemical facility.
