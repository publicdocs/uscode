## § 321a. Evacuation plans and exercises

    (a) __In general__ 

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject to subsection (d), grants made to States or local or tribal governments by the Department through the State Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to—

        (1) establish programs for the development and maintenance of mass evacuation plans under subsection (b) in the event of a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster;

        (2) prepare for the execution of such plans, including the development of evacuation routes and the purchase and stockpiling of necessary supplies and shelters; and

        (3) conduct exercises of such plans.

    (b) __Plan development__ 

    In developing the mass evacuation plans authorized under subsection (a), each State, local, or tribal government shall, to the maximum extent practicable—

        (1) establish incident command and decision making processes;

        (2) ensure that State, local, and tribal government plans, including evacuation routes, are coordinated and integrated;

        (3) identify primary and alternative evacuation routes and methods to increase evacuation capabilities along such routes such as conversion of two-way traffic to one-way evacuation routes;

        (4) identify evacuation transportation modes and capabilities, including the use of mass and public transit capabilities, and coordinating and integrating evacuation plans for all populations including for those individuals located in hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutional living facilities;

        (5)

         develop procedures for informing the public of evacuation plans before and during an evacuation, including individuals—

            (A) with disabilities or other special needs, including the elderly;

            (B) with limited English proficiency; or

            (C) who might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining such information; and

        (6) identify shelter locations and capabilities.

    (c) __Assistance__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Administrator may establish any guidelines, standards, or requirements determined appropriate to administer this section and to ensure effective mass evacuation planning for State, local, and tribal areas.

        (2) __Requested assistance__ 

            The Administrator shall make assistance available upon request of a State, local, or tribal government to assist hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions that house individuals with special needs to establish, maintain, and exercise mass evacuation plans that are coordinated and integrated into the plans developed by that State, local, or tribal government under this section.

    (d) __Multipurpose funds__ 

        Nothing in this section may be construed to preclude a State, local, or tribal government from using grant funds in a manner that enhances preparedness for a natural or man-made disaster unrelated to an act of terrorism, if such use assists such government in building capabilities for terrorism preparedness.
