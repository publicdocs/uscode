        (1) train and periodically retrain relevant Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and other Department personnel that the Secretary considers appropriate, with respect to how to effectively deter, detect, and disrupt human trafficking, and, where appropriate, interdict a suspected perpetrator of human trafficking, during the course of their primary roles and responsibilities; and

        (2) ensure that the personnel referred to in paragraph (1) regularly receive current information on matters related to the detection of human trafficking, including information that becomes available outside of the Department’s initial or periodic retraining schedule, to the extent relevant to their official duties and consistent with applicable information and privacy laws.

    (b) __Training described__

        (1) methods for identifying suspected victims of human trafficking and, where appropriate, perpetrators of human trafficking;

        (2) for appropriate personnel, methods to approach a suspected victim of human trafficking, where appropriate, in a manner that is sensitive to the suspected victim and is not likely to alert a suspected perpetrator of human trafficking;

        (3) training that is most appropriate for a particular location or environment in which the personnel receiving such training perform their official duties;

        (4) other topics determined by the Secretary to be appropriate; and

        (5) a post-training evaluation for personnel receiving the training.

    (c) __Training curriculum review__
