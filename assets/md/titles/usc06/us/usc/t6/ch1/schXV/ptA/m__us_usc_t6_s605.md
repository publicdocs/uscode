## § 605. State Homeland Security Grant Program

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        There is established a State Homeland Security Grant Program to assist State, local, and tribal governments in preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism.

    (b) __Application__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Each State may apply for a grant under this section, and shall submit such information in support of the application as the Administrator may reasonably require.

        (2) __Minimum contents of application__ 

        The Administrator shall require that each State include in its application, at a minimum—

            (A) the purpose for which the State seeks grant funds and the reasons why the State needs the grant to meet the target capabilities of that State;

            (B) a description of how the State plans to allocate the grant funds to local governments and Indian tribes; and

            (C) a budget showing how the State intends to expend the grant funds.

        (3) __Annual applications__ 

            Applicants for grants under this section shall apply or reapply on an annual basis.

    (c) __Distribution to local and tribal governments__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 45 days after receiving grant funds, any State receiving a grant under this section shall make available to local and tribal governments, consistent with the applicable State homeland security plan—

            (A) not less than 80 percent of the grant funds;

            (B) with the consent of local and tribal governments, items, services, or activities having a value of not less than 80 percent of the amount of the grant; or

            (C) with the consent of local and tribal governments, grant funds combined with other items, services, or activities having a total value of not less than 80 percent of the amount of the grant.

        (2) __Certifications regarding distribution of grant funds to local governments__ 

            A State shall certify to the Administrator that the State has made the distribution to local and tribal governments required under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Extension of period__ 

            The Governor of a State may request in writing that the Administrator extend the period under paragraph (1) for an additional period of time. The Administrator may approve such a request if the Administrator determines that the resulting delay in providing grant funding to the local and tribal governments is necessary to promote effective investments to prevent, prepare for, protect against, or respond to acts of terrorism.

        (4) __Exception__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, or the Virgin Islands.

        (5) __Direct funding__ 

            If a State fails to make the distribution to local or tribal governments required under paragraph (1) in a timely fashion, a local or tribal government entitled to receive such distribution may petition the Administrator to request that grant funds be provided directly to the local or tribal government.

    (d) __Multistate applications__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Instead of, or in addition to, any application for a grant under subsection (b), 2 or more States may submit an application for a grant under this section in support of multistate efforts to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism.

        (2) __Administration of grant__ 

        If a group of States applies for a grant under this section, such States shall submit to the Administrator at the time of application a plan describing—

            (A) the division of responsibilities for administering the grant; and

            (B) the distribution of funding among the States that are parties to the application.

    (e) __Minimum allocation__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In allocating funds under this section, the Administrator shall ensure that—

            (A)

             except as provided in subparagraph (B), each State receives, from the funds appropriated for the State Homeland Security Grant Program established under this section, not less than an amount equal to—
