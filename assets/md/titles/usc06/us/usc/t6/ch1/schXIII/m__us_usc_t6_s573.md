        (3) assesses the current available capabilities to meet such communications needs;

        (4) identifies the gap between such current capabilities and defined requirements; and

        (5)

         includes a national interoperable emergency communications inventory to be completed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission that—
