## § 563c. Inventory utilization

    (a) __In general__ 

        Before the procurement of additional quantities of equipment to fulfill a mission need, the Administrator, to the extent practicable, shall utilize any existing units in the Administration’s inventory to meet that need.

    (b) __Tracking of inventory__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        The Administrator shall establish a process for tracking—

            (A) the location of security-related equipment in the inventory under subsection (a);

            (B) the utilization status of security-related technology in the inventory under subsection (a); and

            (C) the quantity of security-related equipment in the inventory under subsection (a).

        (2) __Internal controls__ 

            The Administrator shall implement internal controls to ensure up-to-date accurate data on security-related technology owned, deployed, and in use.

    (c) __Logistics management__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Administrator shall establish logistics principles for managing inventory in an effective and efficient manner.

        (2) __Limitation on just-in-time logistics__ 

        The Administrator may not use just-in-time logistics if doing so—

            (A) would inhibit necessary planning for large-scale delivery of equipment to airports or other facilities; or

            (B) would unduly diminish surge capacity for response to a terrorist threat.
