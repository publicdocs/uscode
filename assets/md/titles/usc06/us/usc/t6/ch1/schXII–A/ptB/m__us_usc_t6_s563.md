## § 563. 5-year technology investment plan

    (a) __In general__ 

    The Administrator shall—

        (1) not later than 180 days after December 18, 2014, develop and submit to Congress a strategic 5-year technology investment plan, that may include a classified addendum to report sensitive transportation security risks, technology vulnerabilities, or other sensitive security information; and

        (2) to the extent possible, publish the Plan in an unclassified format in the public domain.

    (b) __Consultation__ 

    The Administrator shall develop the Plan in consultation with—

        (1) the Under Secretary for Management;

        (2) the Under Secretary for Science and Technology;

        (3) the Chief Information Officer; and

        (4) the aviation industry stakeholder advisory committee established by the Administrator.

    (c) __Approval__ 

        The Administrator may not publish the Plan under subsection (a)(2) until it has been approved by the Secretary.

    (d) __Contents of Plan__ 

    The Plan shall include—

        (1) an analysis of transportation security risks and the associated capability gaps that would be best addressed by security-related technology, including consideration of the most recent quadrennial homeland security review under [section 347 of this title][/us/usc/t6/s347];

        (2)

         a set of security-related technology acquisition needs that—

            (A) is prioritized based on risk and associated capability gaps identified under paragraph (1); and

            (B) includes planned technology programs and projects with defined objectives, goals, timelines, and measures;

        (3) an analysis of current and forecast trends in domestic and international passenger travel;

        (4) an identification of currently deployed security-related technologies that are at or near the end of their lifecycles;

        (5) an identification of test, evaluation, modeling, and simulation capabilities, including target methodologies, rationales, and timelines necessary to support the acquisition of the security-related technologies expected to meet the needs under paragraph (2);

        (6) an identification of opportunities for public-private partnerships, small and disadvantaged company participation, intragovernment collaboration, university centers of excellence, and national laboratory technology transfer;

        (7) an identification of the Administration’s acquisition workforce needs for the management of planned security-related technology acquisitions, including consideration of leveraging acquisition expertise of other Federal agencies;

        (8) an identification of the security resources, including information security resources, that will be required to protect security-related technology from physical or cyber theft, diversion, sabotage, or attack;

        (9) an identification of initiatives to streamline the Administration’s acquisition process and provide greater predictability and clarity to small, medium, and large businesses, including the timeline for testing and evaluation;

        (10) an assessment of the impact to commercial aviation passengers;

        (11) a strategy for consulting airport management, air carrier representatives, and Federal security directors whenever an acquisition will lead to the removal of equipment at airports, and how the strategy for consulting with such officials of the relevant airports will address potential negative impacts on commercial passengers or airport operations; and

        (12) in consultation with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, an identification of security-related technology interface standards, in existence or if implemented, that could promote more interoperable passenger, baggage, and cargo screening systems.

    (e) __Leveraging the private sector__ 

    To the extent possible, and in a manner that is consistent with fair and equitable practices, the Plan shall—

        (1) leverage emerging technology trends and research and development investment trends within the public and private sectors;

        (2) incorporate private sector input, including from the aviation industry stakeholder advisory committee established by the Administrator, through requests for information, industry days, and other innovative means consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and

        (3) in consultation with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, identify technologies in existence or in development that, with or without adaptation, are expected to be suitable to meeting mission needs.

    (f) __Disclosure__ 

        The Administrator shall include with the Plan a list of nongovernment persons that contributed to the writing of the Plan.

    (g) __Update and report__ 

    Beginning 2 years after the date the Plan is submitted to Congress under subsection (a), and biennially thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to Congress—

        (1) an update of the Plan; and

        (2) a report on the extent to which each security-related technology acquired by the Administration since the last issuance or update of the Plan is consistent with the planned technology programs and projects identified under subsection (d)(2) for that security-related technology.
