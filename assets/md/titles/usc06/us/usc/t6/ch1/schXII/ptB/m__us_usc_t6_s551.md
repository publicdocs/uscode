    (a) __Provision of assistance by officials__ 

        Until the transfer of an agency to the Department, any official having authority over or functions relating to the agency immediately before the effective date of this chapter shall provide to the Secretary such assistance, including the use of personnel and assets, as the Secretary may request in preparing for the transfer and integration of the agency into the Department.

         During the transition period, pending the advice and consent of the Senate to the appointment of an officer required by this chapter to be appointed by and with such advice and consent, the President may designate any officer whose appointment was required to be made by and with such advice and consent and who was such an officer immediately before the effective date of this chapter (and who continues in office) or immediately before such designation, to act in such office until the same is filled as provided in this chapter. While so acting, such officers shall receive compensation at the higher of—

            (A) the rates provided by this chapter for the respective offices in which they act; or
