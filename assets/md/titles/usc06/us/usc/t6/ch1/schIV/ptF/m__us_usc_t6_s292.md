## § 292. Voluntary separation incentive payments

    (a) __Definitions__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1)

            (A) has completed at least 3 years of current continuous service with 1 or more covered entities; and

            (B) is serving under an appointment without time limitation,

            but does not include any person under subparagraphs (A)–(G) of [section 663(a)(2) of Public Law 104–208][/us/pl/104/208/s663/a/2] ([5 U.S.C. 5597][/us/usc/t5/s5597] note);

        (2)

         the term “covered entity” means—

            (A) the Immigration and Naturalization Service;

            (B) the Bureau of Border Security of the Department of Homeland Security; and

            (C) the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security; and

        (3) the term “transfer date” means the date on which the transfer of functions specified under [section 251 of this title][/us/usc/t6/s251] takes effect.

    (b) __Strategic restructuring plan__ 

    Before the Attorney General or the Secretary obligates any resources for voluntary separation incentive payments under this section, such official shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a strategic restructuring plan, which shall include—

        (1) an organizational chart depicting the covered entities after their restructuring pursuant to this chapter;

        (2) a summary description of how the authority under this section will be used to help carry out that restructuring; and

        (3) the information specified in [section 663(b)(2) of Public Law 104–208][/us/pl/104/208/s663/b/2] ([5 U.S.C. 5597][/us/usc/t5/s5597] note).

        As used in the preceding sentence, the “appropriate committees of Congress” are the Committees on Appropriations, Government Reform, and the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations, Governmental Affairs, and the Judiciary of the Senate.

    (c) __Authority__ 

    The Attorney General and the Secretary may, to the extent necessary to help carry out their respective strategic restructuring plan described in subsection (b), make voluntary separation incentive payments to employees. Any such payment—

        (1) shall be paid to the employee, in a lump sum, after the employee has separated from service;

        (2) shall be paid from appropriations or funds available for the payment of basic pay of the employee;

        (3)

         shall be equal to the lesser of—

            (A) the amount the employee would be entitled to receive under [section 5595(c) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5595/c]; or

            (B) an amount not to exceed $25,000, as determined by the Attorney General or the Secretary;

        (4)

         may not be made except in the case of any qualifying employee who voluntarily separates (whether by retirement or resignation) before the end of—

            (A) the 3-month period beginning on the date on which such payment is offered or made available to such employee; or

            (B) the 3-year period beginning on November 25, 2002,

            whichever occurs first;

        (5) shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit; and

        (6) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of any severance pay to which the employee may be entitled under [section 5595 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5595], based on any other separation.

    (d) __Additional agency contributions to the retirement fund__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            In addition to any payments which it is otherwise required to make, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security shall, for each fiscal year with respect to which it makes any voluntary separation incentive payments under this section, remit to the Office of Personnel Management for deposit in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund the amount required under paragraph (2).

        (2) __Amount required__ 

        The amount required under this paragraph shall, for any fiscal year, be the amount under subparagraph (A) or (B), whichever is greater.

            (A) __First method__ 

                The amount under this subparagraph shall, for any fiscal year, be equal to the minimum amount necessary to offset the additional costs to the retirement systems under title 5 (payable out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund) resulting from the voluntary separation of the employees described in paragraph (3), as determined under regulations of the Office of Personnel Management.

            (B) __Second method__ 

                The amount under this subparagraph shall, for any fiscal year, be equal to 45 percent of the sum total of the final basic pay of the employees described in paragraph (3).

        (3) __Computations to be based on separations occurring in the fiscal year involved__ 

            The employees described in this paragraph are those employees who receive a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section based on their separating from service during the fiscal year with respect to which the payment under this subsection relates.

        (4) __Final basic pay defined__ 

            In this subsection, the term “final basic pay” means, with respect to an employee, the total amount of basic pay which would be payable for a year of service by such employee, computed using the employee’s final rate of basic pay, and, if last serving on other than a full-time basis, with appropriate adjustment therefor.

    (e) __Effect of subsequent employment with the Government__ 

        An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section and who, within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts any compensated employment with the Government or works for any agency of the Government through a personal services contract, shall be required to pay, prior to the individual’s first day of employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such payment shall be made to the covered entity from which the individual separated or, if made on or after the transfer date, to the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security (for transfer to the appropriate component of the Department of Homeland Security, if necessary).

    (f) __Effect on employment levels__ 

        (1) __Intended effect__ 

            Voluntary separations under this section are not intended to necessarily reduce the total number of full-time equivalent positions in any covered entity.

        (2) __Use of voluntary separations__ 

            A covered entity may redeploy or use the full-time equivalent positions vacated by voluntary separations under this section to make other positions available to more critical locations or more critical occupations.
