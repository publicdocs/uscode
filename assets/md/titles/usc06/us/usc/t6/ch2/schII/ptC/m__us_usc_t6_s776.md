                (i) an assessment of the effectiveness of the pilot program under this section, including an assessment of cost-savings to the Federal Government and any benefits to individuals and households eligible for assistance under [section 5174 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s5174] under the pilot program;

                (ii) findings and conclusions of the Administrator with respect to the pilot program;
