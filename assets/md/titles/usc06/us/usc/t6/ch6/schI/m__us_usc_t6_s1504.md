             ensure that cyber threat indicators shared with the Federal Government by any non-Federal entity pursuant to [section 1503(c) of this title][/us/usc/t6/s1503/c] through the real-time process described in subsection (c) of this section—

                (i) are shared in an automated manner with all of the appropriate Federal entities;

                (ii)

                    (I) agreed upon unanimously by all of the heads of the appropriate Federal entities;

                    (II) carried out before any of the appropriate Federal entities retains or uses the cyber threat indicators or defensive measures; and
