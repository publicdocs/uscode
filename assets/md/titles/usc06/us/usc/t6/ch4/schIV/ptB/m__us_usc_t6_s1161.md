## § 1161. Railroad transportation security risk assessment and National Strategy

    (a) __Risk assessment__ 

    The Secretary shall establish a Federal task force, including the Transportation Security Administration and other agencies within the Department, the Department of Transportation, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to complete, within 6 months of August 3, 2007, a nationwide risk assessment of a terrorist attack on railroad carriers. The assessment shall include—

        (1) a methodology for conducting the risk assessment, including timelines, that addresses how the Department will work with the entities described in subsection (c) and make use of existing Federal expertise within the Department, the Department of Transportation, and other appropriate agencies;

        (2) identification and evaluation of critical assets and infrastructure, including tunnels used by railroad carriers in high-threat urban areas;

        (3) identification of risks to those assets and infrastructure;

        (4) identification of risks that are specific to the transportation of hazardous materials via railroad;

        (5) identification of risks to passenger and cargo security, transportation infrastructure protection systems, operations, communications systems, and any other area identified by the assessment;

        (6) an assessment of employee training and emergency response planning;

        (7) an assessment of public and private operational recovery plans, taking into account the plans for the maritime sector required under [section 70103 of title 46][/us/usc/t46/s70103], to expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the return of an adversely affected railroad transportation system or facility to its normal performance level after a major terrorist attack or other security event on that system or facility; and

        (8) an account of actions taken or planned by both public and private entities to address identified railroad security issues and an assessment of the effective integration of such actions.

    (b) __National Strategy__ 

        (1) __Requirement__ 

            Not later than 9 months after August 3, 2007, and based upon the assessment conducted under subsection (a), the Secretary, consistent with and as required by section 114(t)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 49, shall develop and implement the modal plan for railroad transportation, entitled the “National Strategy for Railroad Transportation Security”.

        (2) __Contents__ 

        The modal plan shall include prioritized goals, actions, objectives, policies, mechanisms, and schedules for, at a minimum—

            (A) improving the security of railroad tunnels, railroad bridges, railroad switching and car storage areas, other railroad infrastructure and facilities, information systems, and other areas identified by the Secretary as posing significant railroad-related risks to public safety and the movement of interstate commerce, taking into account the impact that any proposed security measure might have on the provision of railroad service or on operations served or otherwise affected by railroad service;

            (B) deploying equipment and personnel to detect security threats, including those posed by explosives and hazardous chemical, biological, and radioactive substances, and any appropriate countermeasures;

            (C) consistent with [section 1167 of this title][/us/usc/t6/s1167], training railroad employees in terrorism prevention, preparedness, passenger evacuation, and response activities;

            (D) conducting public outreach campaigns for railroads regarding security, including educational initiatives designed to inform the public on how to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from a terrorist attack on railroad transportation;

            (E) providing additional railroad security support for railroads at high or severe threat levels of alert;

            (F) ensuring, in coordination with freight and intercity and commuter passenger railroads, the continued movement of freight and passengers in the event of an attack affecting the railroad system, including the possibility of rerouting traffic due to the loss of critical infrastructure, such as a bridge, tunnel, yard, or station;

            (G) coordinating existing and planned railroad security initiatives undertaken by the public and private sectors;

            (H)

             assessing—

                (i) the usefulness of covert testing of railroad security systems;

                (ii) the ability to integrate security into infrastructure design; and

                (iii) the implementation of random searches of passengers and baggage; and

            (I) identifying the immediate and long-term costs of measures that may be required to address those risks and public and private sector sources to fund such measures.

        (3) __Responsibilities__ 

        The Secretary shall include in the modal plan a description of the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of Federal, State, and local agencies, government-sponsored entities, tribal governments, and appropriate stakeholders described in subsection (c). The plan shall also include—

    (d) __Adequacy of existing plans and strategies__ 

        In developing the risk assessment and National Strategy required under this section, the Secretary shall utilize relevant existing plans, strategies, and risk assessments developed by the Department or other Federal agencies, including those developed or implemented pursuant to section 114(t) 1 of title 49 or Homeland Security Presidential Directive–7, and, as appropriate, assessments developed by other public and private stakeholders.
