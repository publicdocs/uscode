## § 1204. Motor carrier security-sensitive material tracking

    (a) __Communications__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Not later than 6 months after August 3, 2007, consistent with the findings of the Transportation Security Administration’s hazardous materials truck security pilot program, the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration and in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall develop a program to facilitate the tracking of motor carrier shipments of security-sensitive materials and to equip vehicles used in such shipments with technology that provides—

            (A) frequent or continuous communications;

            (B) vehicle position location and tracking capabilities; and

            (C) a feature that allows a driver of such vehicles to broadcast an emergency distress signal.

        (2) __Considerations__ 

        In developing the program required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

            (A) consult with the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate the program with any ongoing or planned efforts for motor carrier or security-sensitive materials tracking at the Department of Transportation;

            (B) take into consideration the recommendations and findings of the report on the hazardous material safety and security operational field test released by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration on November 11, 2004; and

            (C)

             evaluate—

                (i) any new information related to the costs and benefits of deploying, equipping, and utilizing tracking technology, including portable tracking technology, for motor carriers transporting security-sensitive materials not included in the hazardous material safety and security operational field test report released by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration on November 11, 2004;

                (ii) the ability of tracking technology to resist tampering and disabling;

                (iii) the capability of tracking technology to collect, display, and store information regarding the movement of shipments of security-sensitive materials by commercial motor vehicles;

                (iv) the appropriate range of contact intervals between the tracking technology and a commercial motor vehicle transporting security-sensitive materials;

                (v) technology that allows the installation by a motor carrier of concealed electronic devices on commercial motor vehicles that can be activated by law enforcement authorities to disable the vehicle or alert emergency response resources to locate and recover security-sensitive materials in the event of loss or theft of such materials;

                (vi) whether installation of the technology described in clause (v) should be incorporated into the program under paragraph (1);

                (vii) the costs, benefits, and practicality of such technology described in clause (v) in the context of the overall benefit to national security, including commerce in transportation; and

                (viii) other systems and information the Secretary determines appropriate.

    (b) __Funding__ 

    From the amounts appropriated pursuant to [section 114(w) of title 49][/us/usc/t49/s114/w], there shall be made available to the Secretary to carry out this section—

        (1) $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 of which $3,000,000 may be used for equipment;

        (2) $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 of which $3,000,000 may be used for equipment; and

        (3) $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 of which $3,000,000 may be used for equipment.
