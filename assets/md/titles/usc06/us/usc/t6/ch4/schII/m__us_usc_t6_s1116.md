        (2) __Explosives detection canine teams__ 

        The Secretary of Homeland Security shall increase the number of explosives detection canine teams by—

            (B) partnering with other Federal, State, or local agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, or the private sector to increase the training capacity for canine detection teams;

            (C) procuring explosives detection canines trained by nonprofit organizations, universities, or the private sector provided they are trained in a manner consistent with the standards and requirements developed pursuant to subsection (c) or other criteria developed by the Secretary; or

            Based on the feasibility in meeting the ongoing demand for quality explosives detection canine teams, the Secretary shall establish criteria, including canine training curricula, performance standards, and other requirements approved by the Transportation Security Administration necessary to ensure that explosives detection canine teams trained by nonprofit organizations, universities, and private sector entities are adequately trained and maintained.

        In developing and implementing such curriculum, performance standards, and other requirements, the Secretary shall—

            (A) coordinate with key stakeholders, including international, Federal, State, and local officials, and private sector and academic entities to develop best practice guidelines for such a standardized program, as appropriate;

            (C) review the status of the private sector programs on at least an annual basis to ensure compliance with training curricula, performance standards, and other requirements.

    (d) __Deployment__ 

    The Secretary shall—

        (2) make available explosives detection canine teams to all modes of transportation, for high-risk areas or to address specific threats, on an as-needed basis and as otherwise determined appropriate by the Secretary;

        (3) encourage, but not require, any transportation facility or system to deploy TSA-certified explosives detection canine teams developed under this section; and
