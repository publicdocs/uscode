            (A) the Port of Entry Infrastructure Assessment Study prepared by the United States Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the General Services Administration in accordance with the matter relating to the ports of entry infrastructure assessment set forth in the joint explanatory statement on page 67 of conference report 106–319, accompanying [Public Law 106–58][/us/pl/106/58]; and

            (B) the nationwide strategy to prioritize and address the infrastructure needs at the land ports of entry prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration in accordance with the committee recommendations on page 22 of Senate report 108–86, accompanying [Public Law 108–90][/us/pl/108/90];

        (2) update the assessment of the infrastructure needs of all United States land ports of entry; and

        (3) submit an updated assessment of land port of entry infrastructure needs to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the House Committee on Homeland Security.

    (b) __Consultation__ 

        In preparing the updated studies required under subsection (a), the Commissioner and the Administrator of General Services shall consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary, and affected State and local agencies on the northern and southern borders of the United States.

    (c) __Content__ 

    Each updated study required in subsection (a) shall—

        (1) identify port of entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects that would enhance border security and facilitate the flow of legitimate commerce if implemented;

        (2) include the projects identified in the National Land Border Security Plan required by [section 1403 of this title][/us/usc/t6/s1403]; and

        (3)

         prioritize the projects described in paragraphs (1) and (2) based on the ability of a project—

            (A) to enhance the ability of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to achieve its mission and to support operations;

            (B) to fulfill security requirements; and

            (C) facilitate trade across the borders of the United States.

    (d) __Project implementation__ 

    The Commissioner, as appropriate, shall—

        (1) implement the infrastructure and technology improvement projects described in subsection (c) in the order of priority assigned to each project under subsection (c)(3); or

    (e) __Divergence from priorities__ 

        The Commissioner may diverge from the priority order if the Commissioner determines that significantly changed circumstances, including immediate security needs, changes in infrastructure in Mexico or Canada, or similar concerns, compellingly alter the need for a project in the United States.
