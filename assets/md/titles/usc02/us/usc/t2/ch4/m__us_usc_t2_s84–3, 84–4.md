 __Codification__ 

    Section 84–3, which related to compensation of Deputy Sergeant at Arms (charge of pairs), was based on House Resolution No. 138, Feb. 2, 1961, which was enacted into permanent law by [Pub. L. 87–130, § 103][/us/pl/87/130/s103], Aug. 10, 1961, [75 Stat. 334][/us/stat/75/334]. See section 291 et seq. of this title.

    Section 84–4, which related to compensation of a clerk-messenger in office of Parliamentarian, was based on House Resolution No. 603, Apr. 16, 1962, which was enacted into permanent law by [Pub.
