 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 31a–1 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s31a–1] prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.

    Section is based on the three provisos in paragraph under heading “Expense Allowances of the Vice President, Majority and Minority Leaders and Majority and Minority Whips” in the appropriation for the Senate in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1977 ([Pub. L. 95–26][/us/pl/95/26]), and section 109 of the Congressional Operations Appropriation Act, 1978, which is title I of the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act, 1978 ([Pub. L. 95–94][/us/pl/95/94]), and subsequent acts cited in the credits to this section.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—[Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447] substituted “$40,000” for “$20,000”.

    2003—[Pub. L. 108–7][/us/pl/108/7] substituted “$20,000” for “$10,000” and “not exceed $10,000” for “not exceed $5,000”.

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

    1983—[Pub. L. 98–63][/us/pl/98/63] substituted provisions increasing allowances for each Whip to $5,000 each fiscal year, effective fiscal year 1983 and each fiscal year thereafter, for provisions authorizing not to exceed $2,500 each fiscal year for each Whip, effective Apr. 1, 1977.

    1978—[Pub. L. 95–355][/us/pl/95/355] substituted provisions increasing allowances for each leader to $10,000 each fiscal year, effective fiscal year 1978 and each fiscal year thereafter, for provisions authorizing not to exceed $5,000 each fiscal year for each leader, effective with fiscal year 1977 and each fiscal year thereafter.

 __Effective Date of 2004 Amendment__ 

[Pub. L. 108–447, div. G, title I, § 13(c)][/us/pl/108/447/s13/c], Dec. 8, 2004, [118 Stat. 3172][/us/stat/118/3172], provided that:
