    (c) __Prohibition of waiver__ 

    The Speaker of the House may not exercise his authority under this section to waive any claim—

        (2) if the application for waiver is received in his office after the expiration of 3 years immediately following the date on which the erroneous payment of pay or allowances was discovered.

    (d) __Credit for waiver__ 

        In the audit and settlement of the accounts of any accountable officer or official, full credit shall be given for any amounts with respect to which collection by the United States is waived under this section.

    (e) __Effect of waiver__ 

        An erroneous payment, the collection of which is waived under this section, is deemed a valid payment for all purposes.

    (f) __Construction with other laws__ 

        This section does not affect any authority under any other law to litigate, settle, compromise, or waive any claim of the United States.
