## § 4575. Gross rate of compensation of employees paid by Secretary of Senate

    (a) __Annual rate; certification__ 

        (1) Whenever the rate of compensation of any employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate is fixed or adjusted on or after October 1, 1980, such rate as so fixed or adjusted shall be at a single whole dollar per annum gross rate and may not include a fractional part of a dollar.

        (2) New or changed rates of compensation (other than changes in rates which are made by law) of any such employee (other than an employee who is an elected officer of the Senate) shall be certified in writing to the Disbursing Office of the Senate (and, for purposes of this paragraph, a new rate of compensation refers to compensation in the case of an appointment, transfer from one Senate appointing authority to another, or promotion by an appointing authority to a position the compensation for which is fixed by law). In the case of an appointment or other new rate of compensation, the certification must be received by such office on or before the day the rate of new compensation is to become effective. In any other case, the changed rate of compensation shall take effect on the first day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received within the first ten days of such month), on the first day of the month after the month in which such certification is received (if the day on which such certification is received is after the twenty-fifth day of the month in which it is received), and on the sixteenth day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received after the tenth day and before the twenty-sixth day of such month). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the certification for a changed rate of compensation for an employee specifies an effective date of such change, such change shall become effective on the date so specified, but only if the date so specified is the first or sixteenth day of a month and is after the effective date prescribed in the preceding sentence; and, notwithstanding such sentence and the preceding provisions of this sentence, any changed rate of compensation for a new employee or an employee transferred from one appointing authority to another shall take effect on the date of such employee’s appointment or transfer (as the case may be) if such date is later than the effective date for such changed rate of compensation as prescribed by such sentence.

    (b) __Conversion; increase in compensation__ 

        The rate of compensation of each employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate which was fixed before August 1, 1967, at a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is payable by law shall be converted as of such date to the lowest per annum gross rate which is a multiple of $180 and which is not less than the aggregate rate of compensation (basic compensation plus additional compensation provided by law) which such employee was receiving immediately prior to such date. Any increments of longevity compensation to which an employee became entitled prior to August 1, 1967, under [section 4507(b) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s4507/b] shall be excluded in converting such employee’s rate of compensation under this subsection, but such employee’s rate of gross compensation shall be increased by $540 (which shall be considered to be an increase under [section 4507(b) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s4507/b]) for each such increment.

    (c) __Reference in other provisions to basic rates and additional compensation as reference to per annum gross rate__ 

        In any case in which the rate of compensation of any employee or position, or class of employees or positions, the compensation for which is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, or any maximum or minimum rate with respect to any such employee, position, or class, is referred to in or provided by statute or Senate resolution, and the rate so referred to or provided is a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is provided by law, such statutory provision or resolution shall be deemed to refer, in lieu of such basic rate, to the per annum gross rate which an employee receiving such basic rate immediately prior to August 1, 1967, would receive (without regard to such statutory provision or resolution) under subsection (b) on and after such date.

    (d) __Compensation of employees in office of Senator; limitation; titles of positions__

                For any fiscal year, the population of a State shall be deemed to be whichever of the following is the higher:

                (I) the population of such State (as determined for purposes of this paragraph) for the preceding fiscal year; or

                (II) the population of such State as of the first day of such fiscal year, as determined by the latest census (provisional or otherwise) conducted prior to such first day by the Bureau of the Census within the Department of Commerce.

                If the population of any State, as determined under the preceding sentence, is not evenly divisible by 1,000,000, the population of such State shall be deemed to be increased to the next higher multiple of 1,000,000.

                If, for any period after a fiscal year has begun, the census figures of the most recent census conducted prior to the first day of such year have not been officially released, then, for such period, in the administration of this paragraph, it shall be assumed that the population of each State is the same as such State’s population (as determined for purposes of this paragraph) for the preceding fiscal year.

                In the event that the term of office of a Senator begins after the first month of a fiscal year or ends (except by reason of death, resignation, or expulsion) before the last month of a fiscal year, the aggregate amount available for gross compensation of employees in the office of such Senator for such year shall be the applicable amount contained in the preceding table, divided by 12, and multiplied by the number of months in such year which are included in the Senator’s term of office, counting any fraction of a month as a full month.

                shall not exceed the aggregate of—

                (iii) subject to the next sentence, the amount by which (I) the aggregate of the gross compensation which may be paid to employees in the office of such Senator for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1988, as determined under this subsection (but without regard to this subparagraph), exceeds (II) the aggregate amount of gross compensation which is paid to employees in the office of such Senator for that part of such fiscal year which precedes January 1, 1988, plus

                (iv) the amount described in [section 6314(b)(2)(A)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s6314/b/2/A/iii].

                In the event that the term of office of a Senator begins after the first month of the period which commences January 1, 1988, and ends September 30, 1988, or ends (except by reason of death, resignation, or expulsion) before the last month of such period, the amount computed pursuant to clause (iii) of this subparagraph (but before application of this sentence) shall be recalculated as follows: such amount, as so computed, shall be divided by 9, and multiplied by the number of months in such period which are included in the Senator’s term of office, counting any fraction of a month as a full month.

            (C)

             In the case of gross compensation paid to employees in the office of a Senator for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1988, or any fiscal year thereafter, the total of—

                (i) the aggregate amount of gross compensation which is paid to employees in the office of such Senator for such year, plus

                shall not exceed the aggregate of—

                (iii) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) for such year, plus

                (iv) the amount described in [section 6314(b)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s6314/b/3] (as determined without regard to subparagraph (A)(ii) and (iv) thereof).

        (2) Within the limits prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, Senators may fix the number and the rates of compensation of employees in their respective offices. The salary of an employee in a Senator’s office shall not be fixed under this paragraph at a rate less than $2,677 or in excess of $169,459 per annum.
