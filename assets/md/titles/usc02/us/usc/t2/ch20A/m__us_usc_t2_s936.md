        (2) the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of title 26;

        (3) the AMT; and

        (4)

         provisions of EGTRRA or JGTRRA that amended title 26 (or provisions in later statutes further amending the amendments made by EGTRRA or JGTRRA), other than—

            (A) the provisions of those 2 Acts that were made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ([Public Law 109–280][/us/pl/109/280]);

            (B) amendments to the Estate and Gift Tax referred to in paragraph (2);

            (C) the AMT referred to in paragraph (3); and

    (b) __Duration__ 

        This section shall remain in effect through December 31, 2011.

    (c) __Medicare payments to physicians__ 

        (1) __Criteria__ 

            Legislation that includes provisions amending or superseding the system for updating payments under subsections (d) and (f) of [section 1395w–4 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–4] shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.

        (2) __Adjustment__ 

        The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between—

            (A) estimated net outlays attributable to the payment rates and related parameters in accordance with subsections (d) and (f) of [section 1395w–4 of title 42][/us/usc/t42/s1395w–4] (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect); and

            (B)

             what those net outlays would have been if—

    (d) __Estate and Gift Tax__ 

        (1) __Criteria__

            (A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect); and

            (B) what those revenue collections would have been if, on the date of enactment of the legislation meeting the criteria in paragraph (1), estate and gift tax law had instead been amended so that the tax rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related parameters in effect for tax year 2009 had remained in effect through December 31, 2011, with nominal exemption amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection (g).

        (3) __Limitation__
