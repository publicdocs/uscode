For purposes of the preceding sentence, any sale or lease of property, supplies, or services to the Senate (or any office or instrumentality thereof) or to the House of Representatives (or any office or instrumentality thereof) shall be deemed to be a sale or lease of such property, supplies, or services to the Congress.
