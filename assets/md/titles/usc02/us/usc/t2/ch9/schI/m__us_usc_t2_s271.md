    There shall be in the Senate an office to be known as the Office of the Legislative Counsel, and to be under the direction of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate.

See [section 281 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s281] for provisions establishing Office of the Legislative Counsel for the House of Representatives and [section 282 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s282] for provisions vesting management, etc., in the Legislative Counsel.

 __Appropriations__ 

[Act Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753][/us/act/1946-08-02/ch753], § 204, [60 Stat. 837][/us/stat/60/837], provided:
