## § 276. Disbursement of appropriations

([Feb. 24, 1919, ch. 18][/us/act/1919-02-24/ch18], title XIII, § 1303(c), (d), [40 Stat. 1142][/us/stat/40/1142]; [June 2, 1924, ch. 234][/us/act/1924-06-02/ch234], title XI, § 1101, [43 Stat. 353][/us/stat/43/353].)

 __Codification__ 

    As originally enacted, section provided for disbursement of one-half of appropriations for office of legislative counsel by Secretary of Senate and one-half by Clerk of House of Representatives. In view of nonapplicability of section to Speaker, employee, etc., of the House of Representatives pursuant to [section 531 of Pub. L. 91–510][/us/pl/91/510/s531], set out as a note under [section 281 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s281], section has been revised to limit application to Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate. See [section 282c of this title][/us/usc/t2/s282c] for provisions relating to expenditures by Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives.
