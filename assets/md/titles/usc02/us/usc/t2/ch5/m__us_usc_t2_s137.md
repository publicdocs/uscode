## § 137. Use and regulation of law library

    The justices of the Supreme Court shall have free access to the law library; and they are authorized to make regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the use of the same during the sittings of the court. But such regulations shall not restrict any person authorized to take books from the Library from having access to the law library, or using the books therein in the same manner as he may be entitled to use the books of the general Library.

(R.S. § 95.)

 __Codification__ 

    R.S. § 95 derived from [act July 14, 1832, ch. 221, § 2][/us/act/1832-07-14/ch221/s2], [4 Stat. 579][/us/stat/4/579].

§§ 137a, 137b. __Omitted__ 

 __Codification__ 

    Section 137a, R.S. § 94, related to persons specially privileged to use library. See last sentence of [section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s136], which gives Librarian of Congress power to make rules and regulations for government of library.

    Section 137b, act Aug. 28, 1890, No. 41, [26 Stat. 678][/us/stat/26/678], which related to Interstate Commerce Commission and Chief of Army Engineering Corps, was omitted from the Code as superseded by the last sentence of [section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s136].

 __Joint Committee Report__ 

    With reference to former [section 137a of this title][/us/usc/t2/s137a], the Joint Committee on the Library, in an official report March 3, 1897 (54th Cong., 2d Sess., Senate Report 1573) declared:

    “Heretofore the Joint Committee on the Library has had authority to approve such rules and regulations as have been made by the Librarian of Congress, but the provision of law under which the Joint Committee has hitherto passed upon said rules and regulations would appear to be repealed by the more recent act ([section 136 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s136]) which places this power in the hands of the Librarian of Congress.”
