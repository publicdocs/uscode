## § 182. Cooperative Acquisitions Program Revolving Fund

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        Effective October 1, 1997, there is established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund to be known as the Cooperative Acquisitions Program Revolving Fund (in this section referred to as the “revolving fund”). Moneys in the revolving fund shall be available to the Librarian of Congress, without fiscal year limitation, for financing the cooperative acquisitions program (in this section referred to as the “program”) under which the Library acquires foreign publications and research materials on behalf of participating institutions on a cost-recovery basis. Obligations under the revolving fund are limited to amounts specified in the appropriations Act for that purpose for any fiscal year.

    (b) __Amounts deposited__ 

    The revolving fund shall consist of—

        (1) any amounts appropriated by law for the purposes of the revolving fund;

        (2) any amounts held by the Librarian as of October 1, 1997 or October 7, 1997, whichever is later, that were collected as payment for the Library’s indirect costs of the program; and

        (3) the difference between (A) the total value of the supplies, equipment, gift fund balances, and other assets of the program, and (B) the total value of the liabilities (including unfunded liabilities such as the value of accrued annual leave of employees) of the program.

    (c) __Credits to revolving fund__ 

        The revolving fund shall be credited with all advances and amounts received as payment for purchases under the program and services and supplies furnished to program participants, at rates estimated by the Librarian to be adequate to recover the full direct and indirect costs of the program to the Library over a reasonable period of time.

    (d) __Unobligated balances__ 

        Any unobligated and unexpended balances in the revolving fund that the Librarian determines to be in excess of amounts needed for activities financed by the revolving fund, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. Amounts needed for activities financed by the revolving fund means the direct and indirect costs of the program, including the costs of purchasing, shipping, binding of books and other library materials; supplies, materials, equipment and services needed in support of the program; salaries and benefits; general overhead; and travel.

    (e) __Audit__ 

        The revolving fund shall be subject to audit by the Comptroller General at the Comptroller General’s discretion.
