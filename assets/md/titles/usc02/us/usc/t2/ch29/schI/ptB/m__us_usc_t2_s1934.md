    (a) __Waiver of claim__ 

        Subject to the joint approval of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate, the Chief of the United States Capitol Police may waive in whole or in part a claim of the United States against a person arising out of an erroneous payment of any pay or allowances, other than travel and transportation expenses and allowances, to an officer, member, or employee of the United States Capitol Police, if the collection of the claim would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States.

    (b) __Investigation of application; report__ 

        The Chief shall investigate each application for the waiver of a claim under subsection (a) and shall submit a written report of the investigation, including a description of the facts and circumstances of the claim, to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate, except that if the aggregate amount of the claim involved exceeds $1,500, the Comptroller General may also investigate the application and submit a written report of the investigation, including a description of the facts and circumstances of the claim, to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate.

    (c) __Prohibition of waiver under certain circumstances__

        (2) the Chief receives the application for the waiver after the expiration of the 3-year period that begins on the date on which the erroneous payment of pay or allowances was discovered.
