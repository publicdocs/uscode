            (C) shall be based on the rate of basic pay in effect with respect to the member or civilian employee on the last day of service of the member or civilian employee;

            (E) shall be considered pay for taxation purposes only; and

            (B) elect to have the leave remain to the credit of such member or civilian employee until such member or civilian employee returns from active duty.

        (4) The Capitol Police Board may prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection. No lump sum payment may be paid under this subsection until such regulations are approved by the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate and the Committee on House Oversight of the House of Representatives. All regulations approved under this subsection shall have the force and effect of law.
