    For the purpose of carrying out his duties, the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate is authorized to incur official travel expenses during each fiscal year not to exceed the sums made available for such purpose under appropriations Acts. With the approval of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate and in accordance with such regulations as may be promulgated by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the Secretary of the Senate is authorized to advance to the Sergeant at Arms or to any designated employee under the jurisdiction of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, such sums as may be necessary to defray official travel expenses incurred in carrying out the duties of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper. The receipt of any such sum so advanced to the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper or to any designated employee shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be the duty of the traveler, as soon as practicable, to furnish to the Secretary of the Senate a detailed voucher of the expenses incurred for the travel with respect to which the sum was so advanced, and make settlement with respect to such sum. Payments under this section shall be made from funds included in the appropriations account, within the contingent fund of the Senate, for the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, upon vouchers approved by the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 61f–1a of this title][/us/usc/t2/s61f–1a] prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.

 __Amendments__ 

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–520][/us/pl/101/520] amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: “For the purpose of carrying out his duties, the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate is authorized to incur official travel expenses not to exceed $250,000 during any fiscal year. With the approval of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, the Secretary of the Senate is authorized to advance to any designated employee under the jurisdiction of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper such sums as may be necessary, not exceeding $1,000, to defray official travel expenses in assisting the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper in carrying out his duties. Any such employee shall, as soon as practicable, furnish to the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper a detailed voucher for such expenses incurred and make settlement with respect to any amount so advanced. For purposes of this section, official travel expenses includes travel expenses incurred in connection with training of employees only if the training has been approved by the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate. Payments under this section shall be made from funds included in the appropriation ‘Miscellaneous Items’ under the heading ‘Contingent Expenses of the Senate’ upon vouchers approved by the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper.”

    1988—[Pub. L. 100–458][/us/pl/100/458], which directed the substitution of “not to exceed $250,000 during any fiscal year” for “not to exceed $167,000 during any fiscal year” was executed by making the substitution for “not exceeding $167,000 during any fiscal year” as the probable intent of Congress because of absence of “not to exceed” in text.

    1981—[Pub. L. 97–12][/us/pl/97/12] substituted “$167,000” for “$92,000”.

    1979—[Pub. L. 96–86][/us/pl/96/86] substituted “$92,000” for “$25,000”.
