## § 384. Service and filing of papers other than notice of contest

    (a) __Modes of service__ 

    Except for the notice of contest, every paper required to be served shall be served upon the attorney representing the party, or, if he is not represented by an attorney, upon the party himself. Service upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made:

        (1) by delivering a copy to him personally;

        (2) by leaving it at his principal office with some person then in charge thereof; or if the office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with a person of discretion not less than sixteen years of age then residing therein; or

        (3) by mailing it addressed to the person to be served at his residence or principal office. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

    (b) __Filing of papers with clerk__ 

        All papers subsequent to the notice of contest required to be served upon the opposing party shall be filed with the Clerk either before service or within a reasonable time thereafter.

    (c) __Proof of service__ 

        Papers filed subsequent to the notice of contest shall be accompanied by proof of service showing the time and manner of service, made by affidavit of the person making service or by certificate of an attorney representing the party in whose behalf service is made. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of such service.
