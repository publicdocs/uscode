        Any party aggrieved by the decision of a hearing officer under [section 1405(g) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s1405/g] may file a petition for review by the Board not later than 30 days after entry of the decision in the records of the Office.

    (b) __Parties’ opportunity to submit argument__ 

        The parties to the hearing upon which the decision of the hearing officer was made shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard, through written submission and, in the discretion of the Board, through oral argument.

    (c) __Standard of review__ 

    The Board shall set aside a decision of a hearing officer if the Board determines that the decision was—

        (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not consistent with law;

        (2) not made consistent with required procedures; or

        (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.

    (d) __Record__ 

        In making determinations under subsection (c), the Board shall review the whole record, or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.

    (e) __Decision__ 

        The Board shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. The decision may affirm, reverse, or remand to the hearing officer for further proceedings. A decision that does not require further proceedings before a hearing officer shall be entered in the records of the Office as a final decision.
