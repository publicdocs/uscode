## § 1385. Expenses

    (a) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

    Beginning in fiscal year 1995, and for each fiscal year thereafter, there are authorized to be appropriated for the expenses of the Office such sums as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Office. Until sums are first appropriated pursuant to the preceding sentence, but for a period not exceeding 12 months following January 23, 1995—

        (1) one-half of the expenses of the Office shall be paid from funds appropriated for allowances and expenses of the House of Representatives, and

        (2) one-half of the expenses of the Office shall be paid from funds appropriated for allowances and expenses of the Senate,

        upon vouchers approved by the Executive Director, except that a voucher shall not be required for the disbursement of salaries of employees who are paid at an annual rate. The Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate are authorized to make arrangements for the division of expenses under this subsection, including arrangements for one House of Congress to reimburse the other House of Congress.

    (b) __Financial and administrative services__ 

        The Executive Director may place orders and enter into agreements for goods and services with the head of any agency, or major organizational unit within an agency, in the legislative or executive branch of the United States in the same manner and to the same extent as agencies are authorized under sections 1535 and 1536 of title 31 to place orders and enter into agreements.

    (c) __Witness fees and allowances__ 

        Except for covered employees, witnesses before a hearing officer or the Board in any proceeding under this chapter other than rulemaking shall be paid the same fee and mileage allowances as are paid subpoenaed witnesses in the courts of the United States. Covered employees who are summoned, or are assigned by their employer, to testify in their official capacity or to produce official records in any proceeding under this chapter shall be entitled to travel expenses under subchapter I and section 5751 of chapter 57 of title 5.
