        (2) __Rulemaking procedure__ 

        Such regulations of the Board—

            (A) shall be adopted, approved, and issued in accordance with subsection (b); and

             shall consist of 3 separate bodies of regulations, which shall apply, respectively, to—

    The Board shall adopt the regulations referred to in subsection (a)(1) in accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in [section 553 of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553] and as provided in the following provisions of this subsection:

        (1) __Proposal__ 

            The Board shall publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under [section 553(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553/b], but, instead of publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, the Board shall transmit such notice to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the first day on which both Houses are in session following such transmittal. Such notice shall set forth the recommendations of the Deputy Director for the Senate in regard to regulations under subsection (a)(2)(B)(i), the recommendations of the Deputy Director for the House of Representatives in regard to regulations under subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii), and the recommendations of the Executive Director for regulations under subsection (a)(2)(B)(iii).

        (2) __Comment__ 

            Before adopting regulations, the Board shall provide a comment period of at least 30 days after publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking.

        (3) __Adoption__ 

            After considering comments, the Board shall adopt regulations and shall transmit notice of such action together with a copy of such regulations to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the first day on which both Houses are in session following such transmittal.

        (4) __Recommendation as to method of approval__ 

            The Board shall include a recommendation in the general notice of proposed rulemaking and in the regulations as to whether the regulations should be approved by resolution of the Senate, by resolution of the House of Representatives, by concurrent resolution, or by joint resolution.

    (c) __Approval of regulations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Regulations referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(i) of subsection (a) may be approved by the Senate by resolution or by the Congress by concurrent resolution or by joint resolution.

            Upon receipt of a notice of adoption of regulations under subsection (b)(3), the presiding officers of the House of Representatives and the Senate shall refer such notice, together with a copy of such regulations, to the appropriate committee or committees of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. The purpose of the referral shall be to consider whether such regulations should be approved, and, if so, whether such approval should be by resolution of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, by concurrent resolution or by joint resolution.

        (3) __Joint referral and discharge in the Senate__ 

            The presiding officer of the Senate may refer the notice of issuance of regulations, or any resolution of approval of regulations, to one committee or jointly to more than one committee. If a committee of the Senate acts to report a jointly referred measure, any other committee of the Senate must act within 30 calendar days of continuous session, or be automatically discharged.

    (d) __Issuance and effective date__ 

        (1) __Publication__ 

            After approval of regulations under subsection (c), the Board shall submit the regulations to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the first day on which both Houses are in session following such transmittal.

        (2) __Date of issuance__ 

            The date of issuance of regulations shall be the date on which they are published in the Congressional Record under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Effective date__ 

            Regulations shall become effective not less than 60 days after the regulations are issued, except that the Board may provide for an earlier effective date for good cause found (within the meaning of [section 553(d)(3) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3]) and published with the regulation.

    (e) __Amendment of regulations__ 

        Regulations may be amended in the same manner as is described in this section for the adoption, approval, and issuance of regulations, except that the Board may, in its discretion, dispense with publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking of minor, technical, or urgent amendments that satisfy the criteria for dispensing with publication of such notice pursuant to [section 553(b)(B) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B].
