        (2) Salaries paid to employees appointed upon recommendation of a Senator-elect under subsection (a) shall be charged against the amount of compensation which may be paid to employees in his office under [section 4575(d) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s4575/d] (hereinafter referred to as the “clerk-hire allowance”), for the fiscal year in which his service as a Senator commences. The total amount of salaries paid to employees so appointed upon recommendation of a Senator-elect shall be charged against his clerk-hire allowance for each month in such fiscal year beginning with the month in which his service as a Senator commences (until the total amount has been charged) by whichever of the following amounts is greater: (1) one-ninth of the amount of salaries so paid, or (2) the amount by which the aggregate amount of his clerk-hire allowance which may be paid as of the close of such month under [section 4575(d)(1)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s4575/d/1/B] exceeds the aggregate amount of his clerk-hire allowance actually paid as of the close of such month.
