        Subject to and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, a Senator and the employees in his office shall be reimbursed under this section for travel expenses incurred by the Senator or employee while traveling on official business within the United States. The term “travel expenses” includes actual transportation expenses, essential travel-related expenses, and, where applicable, per diem expenses (but not in excess of actual expenses). A Senator or an employee of the Senator shall not be reimbursed for any travel expenses (other than actual transportation expenses) for any travel occurring during the sixty days immediately before the date of any primary or general election (whether regular, special, or runoff) in which the Senator is a candidate for public office (within the meaning of section 431(b)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original.

    (h) __Individuals serving on panels or other bodies recommending nominees for Federal judgeships, service academies, United States Attorneys, or United States Marshals__ 

        For purposes of subsections (a) and (e), an individual who is selected by a Senator to serve on a panel or other body to make recommendations for nominees to one or more Federal judgeships or to one or more service academies or one or more positions of United States Attorney or United States Marshal shall be considered to be an employee in the office of that Senator with respect to travel and official expenses incurred in performing duties as a member of such panel or other body, and shall be reimbursed (A) for actual transportation expenses and per diem expenses (but not exceeding actual travel expenses) incurred while traveling in performing such duties within the Senator’s home State or between that State and Washington, District of Columbia, and each of the service academies, (B) for official expenses incurred in performing such duties. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), “official expenses” means expenses of the type for which reimbursement may be made to an employee in the office of a Senator when traveling on business of a committee of which that Senator is a member, and, for accounting purposes, such expenses shall be treated as expenses for which reimbursement may be made under subsection (a)(4).

    (i) __Authorization of Secretary of Senate to pay reimbursable expenses__ 

        Whenever a Senator or an employee in his office has incurred an expense for which reimbursement may be made under this section, the Secretary of the Senate is authorized to make payment to that Senator or employee for the expense incurred, subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to reimbursement of the expense under this section.

    (j) __Advances from Senate contingent fund for travel expenses for official business trips; vouchers; settlement__ 

        Whenever a Senator or employee of his office plans an official business trip with respect to which reimbursement for travel expenses is authorized under the preceding provisions of section (a), the Senator (or such an employee who has been designated by the Senator to do so) may, prior to the commencement of such trip and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, obtain from any moneys in the contingent fund of the Senate which are available to him for purposes specified in subsection (a)(6) of this section, such advance sum as he shall certify (and be accountable for), to the Secretary of the Senate, to be necessary to defray some or all of the expenses to be incurred on such trip which expenses are reimbursable under the preceding provisions of this section. The receipt by any Senator for any sum so advanced to him or his order out of the contingent fund of the Senate by the Secretary of the Senate shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be the duty of such Senator (or employee of his office, as the case may be), as soon as practicable, to furnish to the Secretary of the Senate a detailed voucher of the expenses incurred for the travel with respect to which the sum was so advanced, and make settlement with respect to such sum.
