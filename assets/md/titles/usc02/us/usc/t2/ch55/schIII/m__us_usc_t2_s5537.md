## § 5537. Net Expenses of Equipment Revolving Fund

    (a) __Establishment__ 

        There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund for the House of Representatives to be known as the Net Expenses of Equipment Revolving Fund (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Revolving Fund”), consisting of funds deposited by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives from amounts provided by offices of the House of Representatives to purchase, lease, obtain, and maintain the equipment located in such offices, and amounts provided by Members of the House of Representatives (including Delegates and Resident Commissioners to the Congress) to purchase, lease, obtain, and maintain furniture for their district offices.

    (b) __Use of funds__ 

        Amounts in the Revolving Fund shall be used by the Chief Administrative Officer without fiscal year limitation to purchase, lease, obtain, and maintain equipment for offices of the House of Representatives and furniture for the district offices of Members of the House of Representatives (including Delegates and Resident Commissioners to the Congress).

    (c) __Treatment__ 

        The Revolving Fund shall be treated as a category of allowances and expenses for purposes of [section 5507(a) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s5507/a].

    (d) __Applicability to fiscal years__ 

        This section shall apply with respect to fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year, except that for purposes of making deposits into the Revolving Fund under subsection (a), the Chief Administrative Officer may deposit amounts provided by offices of the House of Representatives during fiscal year 2002 or any succeeding fiscal year.

    (e) __Applicability to telecommunications equipment__ 

        This section shall not apply with respect to any telecommunications equipment which is subject to coverage under section 5538  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title (relating to the Net Expenses of Telecommunications Revolving Fund).

([Pub. L. 108–7, div. H, title I][/us/pl/108/7/dH/tI], § 102, Feb. 20, 2003, [117 Stat. 353][/us/stat/117/353]; [Pub. L. 108–447, div. G, title I][/us/pl/108/447/dG/tI], § 102(e), Dec. 8, 2004, [118 Stat. 3174][/us/stat/118/3174].)

 __References in Text__ 

    [Section 5538 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s5538], referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original “section 103 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2005” and was translated as reading “section 102” of that Act, meaning [section 102 of div. G of Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447/dG/s102], to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because [section 103 of div. G of Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447/dG/s103] does not relate to the Net Expenses of Telecommunications Revolving Fund.

 __Codification__ 

    Section was formerly classified to [section 112g of this title][/us/usc/t2/s112g] prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.

    Section is from the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2003, which is div. H of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003.

 __Amendments__ 

    2004—Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447] added subsec. (e).

 __Effective Date of 2004 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447] applicable with respect to fiscal year 2005 and each succeeding fiscal year, see [section 5538(f) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s5538/f].
