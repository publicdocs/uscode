## § 437d. Powers of Commission

    (a) __Specific authorities__ 

    The Commission has the power—

        (1) to require by special or general orders, any person to submit, under oath, such written reports and answers to questions as the Commission may prescribe;

        (2) to administer oaths or affirmations;

        (3) to require by subpena, signed by the chairman or the vice chairman, the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all documentary evidence relating to the execution of its duties;

        (4) in any proceeding or investigation, to order testimony to be taken by deposition before any person who is designated by the Commission and has the power to administer oaths and, in such instances, to compel testimony and the production of evidence in the same manner as authorized under paragraph (3);

        (5) to pay witnesses the same fees and mileage as are paid in like circumstances in the courts of the United States;

        (6) to initiate (through civil actions for injunctive, declaratory, or other appropriate relief), defend (in the case of any civil action brought under [section 437g(a)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437g/a/8]) or appeal any civil action in the name of the Commission to enforce the provisions of this Act and chapter 95 and chapter 96 of title 26, through its general counsel;

        (7) to render advisory opinions under [section 437f of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437f];

        (8) to develop such prescribed forms and to make, amend, and repeal such rules, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act and chapter 95 and chapter 96 of title 26; and

        (9) to conduct investigations and hearings expeditiously, to encourage voluntary compliance, and to report apparent violations to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

    (b) __Judicial orders for compliance with subpenas and orders of Commission; contempt of court__ 

        Upon petition by the Commission, any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is being carried on may, in case of refusal to obey a subpena or order of the Commission issued under subsection (a) of this section, issue an order requiring compliance. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.

    (c) __Civil liability for disclosure of information__ 

        No person shall be subject to civil liability to any person (other than the Commission or the United States) for disclosing information at the request of the Commission.

    (d) __Concurrent transmissions to Congress or Member of budget estimates, etc.; prior submission of legislative recommendations, testimony, or comments on legislation__ 

        (1) Whenever the Commission submits any budget estimate or request to the President or the Office of Management and Budget, it shall concurrently transmit a copy of such estimate or request to the Congress.

        (2) Whenever the Commission submits any legislative recommendation, or testimony, or comments on legislation, requested by the Congress or by any Member of the Congress, to the President or the Office of Management and Budget, it shall concurrently transmit a copy thereof to the Congress or to the Member requesting the same. No officer or agency of the United States shall have any authority to require the Commission to submit its legislative recommendations, testimony, or comments on legislation, to any office or agency of the United States for approval, comments, or review, prior to the submission of such recommendations, testimony, or comments to the Congress.

    (e) __Exclusive civil remedy for enforcement__ 

        Except as provided in [section 437g(a)(8) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437g/a/8], the power of the Commission to initiate civil actions under subsection (a)(6) of this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act.

 __Prior Provisions__ 

    A prior [section 307 of Pub. L. 92–225][/us/pl/92/225/s307] was renumbered section 305, and is classified to [section 437 of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437].

    1986—Subsec. (a)(6), (8). [Pub. L. 99–514][/us/pl/99/514] substituted “Internal Revenue Code of 1986” for “Internal Revenue Code of 1954”, which for purposes of codification was translated as “title 26” thus requiring no change in text.

    1980—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 96–187, § 106][/us/pl/96/187/s106], in par. (1) substituted “under oath, such written reports and answers to questions as the Commission may prescribe” for “in writing such reports and answers to questions as the Commission may prescribe” and struck out provision that such submission be made within such reasonable time and under oath as determined by the Commission; in par. (4) struck out “of this subsection” after “paragraph (3)”; in par. (6) substituted “section 437g(a)(8)” for “section 437g(a)(9)”, and substituted “to enforce the provisions of this Act” for “for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this Act”; struck out par. (9) relating to formulation of general policy respecting administration of this Act and chapters 95 and 96 of title 26; and redesignated former par. (10) as (9).

    Subsec. (e). [Pub. L. 96–187, § 106][/us/pl/96/187/s106], substituted “section 437g(a)(8)” for “section 437g(a)(9)”.

    1976—Subsec. (a)(6). [Pub. L. 94–283, § 107(b)(1)][/us/pl/94/283/s107/b/1], substituted “civil actions” for “civil proceedings” and inserted “(in the case of any civil action brought under section 437g(a) (9) of this title)” after “defend” and “and chapter 95 and chapter 96 of title 26” after “this Act”.

    Subsec. (a)(7). [Pub. L. 94–283, § 115(b)][/us/pl/94/283/s115/b], substituted “section 312” for “section 313” in the original to accommodate the renumbering of [section 313 of Pub.

Since both the original and substituted references translate as “[section 437f of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437f]” no change in text was required.

    Subsec. (a)(8). [Pub. L. 94–283, § 107(a)(1)][/us/pl/94/283/s107/a/1], inserted “to develop such prescribed forms and to” before “to make, amend, and repeal” and inserted “and chapter 95 and chapter 96 of title 26” after “provisions of this Act”.
