    (c) __Voting requirements; delegation of authorities__ 

        All decisions of the Commission with respect to the exercise of its duties and powers under the provisions of this Act shall be made by a majority vote of the members of the Commission. A member of the Commission may not delegate to any person his or her vote or any decisionmaking authority or duty vested in the Commission by the provisions of this Act, except that the affirmative vote of 4 members of the Commission shall be required in order for the Commission to take any action in accordance with paragraph (6), (7), (8), or (9) of [section 437d(a) of this title][/us/usc/t2/s437d/a] or with chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26.

The general counsel shall be paid at a rate not to exceed the rate of basic pay in effect for level V of the Executive Schedule ([5 U.S.C. 5316][/us/usc/t5/s5316]). With the approval of the Commission, the staff director may appoint and fix the pay of such additional personnel as he or she considers desirable without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service.

        (2) With the approval of the Commission, the staff director may procure temporary and intermittent services to the same extent as is authorized by [section 3109(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s3109/b], but at rates for individuals not to exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS–15 of the General Schedule ([5 U.S.C. 5332][/us/usc/t5/s5332]).

        (3) In carrying out its responsibilities under this Act, the Commission shall, to the fullest extent practicable, avail itself of the assistance, including personnel and facilities of other agencies and departments of the United States. The heads of such agencies and departments may make available to the Commission such personnel, facilities, and other assistance, with or without reimbursement, as the Commission may request.

        (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), the Commission is authorized to appear in and defend against any action instituted under this Act, either (A) by attorneys employed in its office, or (B) by counsel whom it may appoint, on a temporary basis as may be necessary for such purpose, without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, and whose compensation it may fix without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title.
