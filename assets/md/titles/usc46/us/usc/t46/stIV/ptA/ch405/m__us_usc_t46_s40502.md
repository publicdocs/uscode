## § 40502. Service contracts

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    An individual ocean common carrier or an agreement between or among ocean common carriers may enter into a service contract with one or more shippers subject to the requirements of this part.

    (b)  __Filing Requirements__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Each service contract entered into under this section by an individual ocean common carrier or an agreement shall be filed confidentially with the Federal Maritime Commission.

        (2)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

        Paragraph (1) does not apply to contracts regarding bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new assembled motor vehicles, waste paper, or paper waste.

    (c)  __Essential Terms__  __.—__ 

    Each service contract shall include—

        (1) the origin and destination port ranges;

        (2) the origin and destination geographic areas in the case of through intermodal movements;

        (3) the commodities involved;

        (4) the minimum volume or portion;

        (5) the line-haul rate;

        (6) the duration;

        (7) service commitments; and

        (8) the liquidated damages for nonperformance, if any.

    (d)  __Publication of Certain Terms__  __.—__ 

    When a service contract is filed confidentially with the Commission, a concise statement of the essential terms specified in paragraphs (1), (3), (4), and (6) of subsection (c) shall be published and made available to the general public in tariff format.

    (e)  __Disclosure of Certain Terms__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

        In this subsection, the terms “dock area” and “within the port area” have the same meaning and scope as in the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the requesting labor organization and the carrier.

        (2)  __Disclosure__  __.—__ 

        An ocean common carrier that is a party to or is otherwise subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization shall, in response to a written request by the labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at a dock area or within a port area in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract:

            (A) The movement of the shipper’s cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area.

            (B) The assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper’s cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area.

            (C) The assignment of the carriage of the shipper’s cargo between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area and a rail yard adjacent to the container yard.

            (D) The assignment of container freight station work and container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area or within the port area.

        (3)  __Within reasonable time__  __.—__ 

        The common carrier shall provide the information described in paragraph (2) to the requesting labor organization within a reasonable period of time.

        (4)  __Existence of collective bargaining agreement__  __.—__ 

        This subsection does not require the disclosure of information by an ocean common carrier unless there exists an applicable and otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement pertaining to that carrier. A disclosure by an ocean common carrier may not be deemed an admission or an agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A dispute about whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of an ocean common carrier under a collective bargaining agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act ([29 U.S.C. 151][/us/usc/t29/s151] et seq.), and without reference to this subsection.

        (5)  __Effect under other laws__  __.—__ 

        This subsection does not affect the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this part or any other Federal or State law of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract.

    (f)  __Remedy for Breach__  __.—__ 

    Unless the parties agree otherwise, the exclusive remedy for a breach of a service contract is an action in an appropriate court. The contract dispute resolution forum may not be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier or by the government that owns or controls the carrier.
