    In the definition of “service contract”, the words “The contract may also specify provisions in the event of nonperformance on the part of any party” are omitted as unnecessary and inappropriate for a definition.

    In the definition of “shipper”, the words “non-vessel-operating common carrier” are substituted for “ocean transportation intermediary, as defined in paragraph (17)(B) of this section” because paragraph (17)(B) contains a definition of “non-vessel-operating common carrier” which is restated as a separate definition.

    The definition of “Commission” is omitted because the full name of the Federal Maritime Commission is used the first time the Commission is referred to in each section. The definition of “person” is omitted as unnecessary because of [1 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t1/s1]. The definition of “United States” is omitted because the term is defined in chapter 1 of the revised title for purposes of the title.
