        (2) suspension, in whole or in part, of any or all tariffs and service contracts, including an ocean common carrier’s right to use any or all tariffs and service contracts of conferences in United States trades of which it is a member for any period the Commission specifies;

        (3) suspension, in whole or in part, of an ocean common carrier’s right to operate under any agreement filed with the Commission, including any agreement authorizing preferential treatment at terminals, preferential terminal leases, space chartering, or pooling of cargo or revenue with other ocean common carriers; and

        (4) a fee not to exceed $1,000,000 per voyage.
