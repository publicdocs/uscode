    In subsection (a), the words “subpoena or” are added in the second sentence for consistency in the subsection. The words “by an appropriate injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “regularly made and duly issued” are substituted for “properly made and duly issued” for consistency in the subtitle.
