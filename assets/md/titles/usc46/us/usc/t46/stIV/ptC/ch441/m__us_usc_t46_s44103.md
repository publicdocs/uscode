    In subsection (d)(2), the words “issued by a bonding company authorized to do business in the United States” are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 817d(b) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or any territory or possession of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
