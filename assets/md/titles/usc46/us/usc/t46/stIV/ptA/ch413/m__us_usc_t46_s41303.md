    In subsection (a)(1), the words “may subpoena witnesses and evidence” are substituted for “may by subpena compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “shall conform to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.)” are substituted for “shall be in conformity with the rules applicable in civil proceedings in the district courts of the United States” for clarity.
