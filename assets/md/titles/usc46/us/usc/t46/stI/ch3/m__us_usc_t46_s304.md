## § 304. Delegation of authority

    (a)  __Delegation__  __.—__ 

    The Federal Maritime Commission, by published order or regulation, may delegate to a division of the Commission, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, or an officer or employee of the Commission, any of its duties or powers, including those relating to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or otherwise acting on any matter. This subsection does not affect [section 556(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s556/b].

    (b)  __Review__  __.—__ 

    The Commission may review any action taken under a delegation of authority under subsection (a). The review may be taken on the Commission’s own initiative or on the petition of a party to or an intervenor in the action, within the time and in the manner prescribed by the Commission. The vote of a majority of the Commission, less one member, is sufficient to bring an action before the Commission for review.

    (c)  __Deemed Action of Commission__  __.—__ 

    If the Commission declines review, or if review is not sought, within the time prescribed under subsection (b), the action taken under the delegation of authority is deemed to be the action of the Commission.
