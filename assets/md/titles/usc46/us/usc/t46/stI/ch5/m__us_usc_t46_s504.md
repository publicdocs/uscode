## § 504. Remission of fees and penalties

    Any part of a fee, tax, or penalty paid or a forfeiture incurred under a law or regulation relating to vessels or seamen may be remitted if—

    (1) application for the remission is made within one year after the date of the payment or forfeiture; and

([Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], § 4, Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1491][/us/stat/120/1491].)

    This section replaces [46 U.S.C. 2108][/us/usc/t46/s2108], which was enacted as part of the codification of subtitle II of title 46 in 1983. That provision was based on [section 26 of the Act of June 26, 1884, ch. 121][/us/act/1884-06-26/ch121/s26], [23 Stat. 59][/us/stat/23/59], which prior to the subtitle II codification appeared at [46 U.S.C. 8][/us/usc/t46/s8] (1982 ed.). In the enactment of [46 U.S.C. 2108][/us/usc/t46/s2108], the scope of the 1884 provision was narrowed, presumably inadvertently. This section restores the remissions authority to its prior scope. Note that 19 C.F.R. § 4.24 (2003) still refers to “the authority to make refunds in accordance with [section 26 of the Act of June 26, 1884][/us/act/1884-06-26/s26] ([46 U.S.C. 8][/us/usc/t46/s8])” as if that provision had not been replaced by [46 U.S.C. 2108][/us/usc/t46/s2108] in 1983.
