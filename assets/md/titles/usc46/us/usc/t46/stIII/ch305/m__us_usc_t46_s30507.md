    This section is substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 183(b) (last sentence) and 184 (words before semicolon) for clarity and consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 184 (words after semicolon) is omitted as unnecessary. See G. Gilmore & C. Black, The Law of Admiralty, § 10–8 (2d ed. 1975).
