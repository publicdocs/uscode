    In subsection (a), the words “and when the decree is for a money judgment” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “except that interest is not allowable for the period before the action is filed” are substituted for “And provided further, That after June 30, 1932, no interest shall be allowed on any claim prior to the time when suit on such claim is brought as authorized by section 742 of this Appendix” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Subsection (b) is substituted for “or at any higher rate which shall be stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based” in 46 App. U.S.C. 743 and “unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest” in 46 App. U.S.C. 745 (last proviso) for clarity and consistency.
