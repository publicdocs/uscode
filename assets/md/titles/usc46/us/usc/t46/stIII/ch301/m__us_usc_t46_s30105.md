    In subsection (b), before paragraph (1), the words “civil action” are substituted for “action” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “under subsection (a) of this section or under any other” are omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (2), the words “its territories, or possessions” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title. In paragraph (3), the word “person” is substituted for “enterprise” for consistency in the revised title.
