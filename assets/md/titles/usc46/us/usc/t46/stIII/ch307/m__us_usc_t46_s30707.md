    In subsection (a), the words “and who refuses to issue on demand the bill of lading herein provided for” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “shall be fined under title 18” are substituted for “shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000” because of chapter 227 of title 18.

    In subsection (b), the words “A civil action in rem to enforce the lien may be brought in the district court of the United States for any district in which the vessel is found” are substituted for “such vessel may be libeled therefor in any district court of the United States” for clarity and to modernize the language.
