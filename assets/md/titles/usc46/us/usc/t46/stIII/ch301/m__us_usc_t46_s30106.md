    The words “civil action” are substituted for “suit” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules or Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “or both” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “must be brought” are substituted for “shall not be maintained unless commenced” for clarity and consistency. The word “arose” is substituted for “accrued” for consistency in the revised title.
