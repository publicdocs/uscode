    The words “a federally-owned corporation” are substituted for “any corporation in which the United States or its representatives shall own the entire outstanding capital stock” because of the definition of “federally-owned corporation” in section 30902 of the revised title. The words “after March 9, 1920” are omitted as obsolete. The words “in view of the provision herein made for a libel in personam” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “or its possessions” are omitted because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words “Provided, That this chapter shall not apply to the Panama Canal Commission” are omitted because the Commission has been dissolved. See [22 U.S.C. 3714a][/us/usc/t22/s3714a].
