    In subsection (a), the words “On demand of a shipper” are added because of the reference to a demand in 46 App. U.S.C. 194. The words “transporting merchandise or property from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports” are omitted because of section 30702(a) of the revised title. The word “lawful” (which modifies “merchandise”) is omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “or weight” are added for consistency with the requirement to state whether it is the carrier’s or shipper’s weight.

    In subsection (b)(3), the word “order” is omitted as redundant to “condition”. The words “delivered to and received by . . . for transportation” are omitted as unnecessary.
