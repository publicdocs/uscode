    The words “Subject to subsection (b) of this section” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “3 nautical miles” are substituted for “a marine league” for clarity. The words “United States” are substituted for “any State, or the District of Columbia, or the Territories or dependencies of the United States” because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words “bring a civil action” are substituted for “maintain a suit” for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words “for damages” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “in the district courts of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary because of [28 U.S.C. 1333][/us/usc/t28/s1333]. The words “person or vessel” are substituted for “vessel, person, or corporation” because of [1 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t1/s1]. The word “responsible” is substituted for “which would have been liable if death had not ensued” to eliminate unnecessary words.
