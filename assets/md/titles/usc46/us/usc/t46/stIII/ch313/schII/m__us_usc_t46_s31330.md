    Section 31330(a) provides for criminal penalties for not disclosing obligations, incurring contractual obligations in violation of section 31323(b), and filing a mortgage made not in good faith. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by adding civil penalties and by making it a crime to record with the Secretary of Transportation a mortgage made not in good faith with the intent to hinder an existing or future creditor of the mortgagor or a lienor of the vessel. This is done since the affidavit of good faith has been eliminated from the elements of a preferred mortgage.

    Section 31330(b) adds criminal and civil penalties for violating the sale and trust requirements under sections 31328 and 31329. It also makes a vessel and its equipment involved in those violations subject to seizure by the Government.

    Section 31330(c) makes the president or chief executive officer of a corporation or association liable as a mortgagor for the penalties under this section.
