    The words “transporting merchandise or property from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports” are omitted because of section 30702(a) of the revised title. The words “may not” are substituted for “It shall not be lawful . . . to”, and the word “provision” is substituted for “clause, covenant, or agreement”, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “any and all lawful” and “committed to its or their charge” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “Any such provision is void” are substituted for “Any and all words or clauses of such import inserted in bills of lading or shipping receipts shall be null and void and of no effect” to eliminate unnecessary words.
