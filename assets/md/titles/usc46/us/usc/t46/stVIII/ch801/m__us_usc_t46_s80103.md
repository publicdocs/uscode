    In subsection (a), the words “of any description whatsoever” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (b), the words “transporting property described in subsection (a) of this section” are substituted for “which shall be engaged or employed in carrying or transporting any property whatsoever, taken from any wreck, from the sea, or from any of the keys or shoals, within the jurisdiction of the United States, on the coast of Florida” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “may be seized by, and forfeited to, the United States Government” are substituted for “shall . . . be forfeited” for consistency in the revised title. The words “together with her tackle, apparel, and furniture” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “accrues half to the informer and half to the Government” are substituted for “one moiety to the informer and the other to the United States” to use more commonly understood language.
