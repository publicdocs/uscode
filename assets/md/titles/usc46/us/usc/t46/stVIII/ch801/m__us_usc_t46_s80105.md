    In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the word “equipment” is substituted for “appurtenance” to use more commonly understood language. The words “and assistance” are omitted as unnecessary.

    Subsection (b) is substituted for “this section shall cease to be in force and effect from and after the date of the proclamation of the President of the United States to the effect that said reciprocol privilege has been withdrawn, revoked, or rendered inoperative by the said Government of the Dominion of Canada” to eliminate unnecessary words.
