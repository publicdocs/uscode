    In subsection (a), the words “certificate of documentation” and “certificate” are substituted for “register” for consistency with chapter 121 of the revised title. In paragraph (2), the words “sold or” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “owned only by citizens of the United States” are substituted for “no foreign subject or citizen has . . . any share, by way of trust, confidence, or otherwise” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
