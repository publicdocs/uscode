        (1) for a foreign port or place;

        (2) for another port or place in the United States if the vessel has on board foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made; or

    Except as otherwise provided by law, a vessel that is not a vessel of the United States shall obtain clearance from the Secretary before proceeding from a port or place in the United States—

        (2) permit clearance to be obtained before all requirements for clearance are complied with, but only if the owner or operator of the vessel files a bond in an amount set by the Secretary conditioned on the compliance by the owner or operator with all specified requirements for clearance within a time period (not exceeding 4 business days) established by the Secretary; and

        (3) permit clearance to be obtained at a place other than a designated port of entry, under conditions the Secretary may prescribe.

    The Secretary of Homeland Security is substituted for the Customs Service and for the Secretary of the Treasury because the functions of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ([Pub. L. 107–296][/us/pl/107/296], [116 Stat. 2178][/us/stat/116/2178]).
