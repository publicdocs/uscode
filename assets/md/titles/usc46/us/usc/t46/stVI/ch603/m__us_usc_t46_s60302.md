        (1) 30 cents per ton on a vessel built in the United States but owned in any part by a subject of a foreign country.

        (2) 50 cents per ton on other vessels not of the United States.

        (3) 50 cents per ton on a vessel of the United States having an officer who is not a citizen of the United States.

        (4) $2 per ton on a foreign vessel entering from a foreign port or place at which vessels of the United States are not ordinarily allowed to enter and trade.

    (b)  __Vessels Not of the United States Transporting Property Between Districts__  __.—__ 

    Regardless of whether a tax is imposed under [section 60301 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s60301], a tax of 50 cents per ton is imposed on a vessel not of the United States at each entry in one customs district from another district when transporting goods loaded in one district to be delivered in another district.

    (c)  __Exception for Vessels Becoming Documented__  __.—__ 

    The tax of 50 cents per ton under this section does not apply to a vessel that—

    In subsections (a) and (b), the words “Regardless of whether a tax is imposed under [section 60301 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s60301]” are added for clarity. See 19 C.F.R. § 4.20(c) (2003).

    In subsection (a)(1), the word “owned” is substituted for “belonging” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “vessel of the United States” are substituted for “vessel” for clarity.

    In subsection (c), the words “The tax of 50 cents per ton” are substituted for “no such duty” in 46 App. U.S.C. 121 to conform more closely to the language in [section 1 of the Act of March 4, 1915][/us/act/1915-03-04/s1] (ch. 171, [38 Stat. 1193][/us/stat/38/1193]). The word “documented” is substituted for “registered” for consistency in the revised title.

    The words “In addition to the tonnage-duty above imposed, there shall be paid a tax, at the rate of thirty cents per ton, on vessels which shall be entered at any custom-house within the United States from any foreign port or place” in R.S. § 4219 were omitted from the original codification of R.S. § 4219 in [46 U.S.C. 121][/us/usc/t46/s121] (1926 edition, [44 Stat. 1467][/us/stat/44/1467]). A codification note which first appeared in the 1958 edition of the United States Code for [46 U.S.C. 121][/us/usc/t46/s121] says that the words apparently were omitted as superseded and repealed by [section 14 of the Act of June 26, 1884][/us/act/1884-06-26/s14] (ch. 121, [23 Stat. 57][/us/stat/23/57]), as amended by [section 11 of the Act of June 19, 1886][/us/act/1886-06-19/s11] (ch. 421, [24 Stat. 81][/us/stat/24/81]), and [section 1 of the Act of April 4, 1888][/us/act/1888-04-04/s1] (ch. 61, [25 Stat. 80][/us/stat/25/80]).
