    In subsection (a), the words “February 28 of each year” are substituted for “February 28, 1987, and annually thereafter” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1802 to eliminate obsolete language. The words “Beginning with the first report submitted under this section after the date of enactment of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002” are omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (b), the words “To the extent practicable, the reports required under sections 903, 905, and 907 \[46 App. U.S.C. 1801 note, 1802, 1803\] shall be consolidated into a single document before being submitted to the Congress” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1809(a) are omitted as unnecessary and obsolete because sections 903 and 907 are being omitted from the revised title and repealed as obsolete. The words “Committee on International Relations” are substituted for “Committee on Foreign Affairs” to reflect changes in committee structure made by the 104th Congress.
