    (a)  __General Requirements__  __.—__

    (b)  __Notice and Recommendations to Other Countries__  __.—__ 

    If the Secretary, after implementing the plan under subsection (a), determines that a port does not maintain and administer effective security measures, the Secretary of State (after being informed by the Secretary) shall—

        (1) notify the appropriate government authorities of the country in which the port is located of the determination; and

        (2) recommend steps necessary to bring the security measures at that port up to the standard used by the Secretary in making the assessment under subsection (a).

    (c)  __Antiterrorism Assistance__  __.—__ 

    The President is encouraged to provide antiterrorism assistance related to maritime security under chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ([22 U.S.C. 2349aa][/us/usc/t22/s2349aa] et seq.) to foreign countries, especially for a port that the Secretary determines under subsection (b) does not maintain and administer effective security measures.
