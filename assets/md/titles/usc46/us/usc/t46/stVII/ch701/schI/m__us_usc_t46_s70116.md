 __Report on Secure System of Transportation Program__ 

[Pub. L. 107–295, title I, § 110(c)][/us/pl/107/295/s110/c], Nov. 25, 2002, [116 Stat. 2092][/us/stat/116/2092], provided that:

>     “(1) evaluates the secure system of transportation program and its components;

>     “(2) states the Secretary’s view as to whether any procedure, system, or technology evaluated as part of the program offers a higher level of security than requiring imported goods to clear customs under existing procedures and for the requirements of the National Maritime Security Plan for reopening of United States ports to commerce;

>     “(3) states the Secretary’s view as to the integrity of the procedures, technology, or systems evaluated as part of the program;

>     “(4) makes a recommendation with respect to whether the program, or any procedure, system, or technology should be incorporated in a nationwide system for preclearance of imports of waterborne goods and for the requirements of the National Maritime Security Plan for the reopening of United States ports to Commerce;

>     “(5) describes the impact of the program on staffing levels at the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, and the Customs Service; and

>     “(6) states the Secretary’s views as to whether there is a method by which the United States could validate foreign ports so that cargo from those ports is preapproved for entry into the United States and for the purpose of the requirements of the National Maritime Security Plan for the reopening of United States ports to commerce.”
