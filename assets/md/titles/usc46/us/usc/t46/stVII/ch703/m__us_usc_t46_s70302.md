## § 70302. International measures for seaport and vessel security

    Congress encourages the President to continue to seek agreement on international seaport and vessel security through the International Maritime Organization. In developing an agreement, each member country of the International Maritime Organization should consult with appropriate private sector interests in that country. The agreement would establish seaport and vessel security measures and could include—

    (1) seaport screening of cargo and baggage similar to that done at airports;

    (2) security measures to restrict access to cargo, vessels, and dockside property to authorized personnel only;

    (3) additional security on board vessels;

    (4) licensing or certification of compliance with appropriate security standards; and

    (5) other appropriate measures to prevent unlawful acts against passengers and crews on vessels.

    The word “vessel” is substituted for “shipboard” for consistency in the revised title. The words “and commends him on his efforts to date” are omitted as unnecessary.
