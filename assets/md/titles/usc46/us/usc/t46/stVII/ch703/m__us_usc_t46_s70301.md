## § 70301. Definitions

    In paragraph (2), the term “vessel of the United States” is omitted because the definition of that term in [46 U.S.C. 2101][/us/usc/t46/s2101] is being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title and will apply generally throughout the title.

    In paragraph (3), the definition of “Secretary” is new. The functions of the Secretary of Transportation under this chapter were carried out by the Coast Guard, and its functions have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ([Pub. L. 107–296][/us/pl/107/296], [116 Stat. 2249][/us/stat/116/2249]).
