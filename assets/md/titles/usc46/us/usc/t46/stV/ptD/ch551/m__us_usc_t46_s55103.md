    This section is substituted for the source provision for consistency with section 55102. See 19 C.F.R. §§ 4.80, 4.80a (2004).

    In subsection (b), the penalty amount reflects the adjustment for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 ([28 U.S.C. 2461][/us/usc/t28/s2461] note). See 19 C.F.R. § 4.80(b)(2) (2004).
