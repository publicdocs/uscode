## § 53723. Payments by Secretary or Administrator and issuance of obligations

    (a)  __Cash Payment__  __.—__ 

    Amounts required to be paid by the Secretary or Administrator under section 53721 or 53722 of this title shall be paid in cash.

    (b)  __Issuance of Obligations__  __.—__ 

    If amounts in the appropriate account under [section 53717 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s53717] are not sufficient to make a payment required under section 53721 or 53722 of this title, the Secretary or Administrator may issue obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary or Administrator, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe the form, denomination, maturity, and other terms (except the interest rate) of the obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall set the interest rate for the obligations, considering the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States Government of comparable maturities during the month before the obligations are issued.

    (c)  __Purchase of Obligations__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase the obligations issued under this section. To purchase the obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include the purchase of obligations under this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell obligations purchased under this section. A redemption, purchase, or sale of the obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury is a public debt transaction of the Government.

    (d)  __Deposits and Redemptions__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary or Administrator shall deposit amounts borrowed under this section in the appropriate account under [section 53717 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s53717] and make redemptions of the obligations from that account.
