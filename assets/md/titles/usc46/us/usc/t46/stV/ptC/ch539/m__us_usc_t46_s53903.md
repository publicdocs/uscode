    In subsections (a)(2) and (b), the words “foreign vessel” are substituted for “foreign-flag vessels” because of the definition of “foreign vessel” in chapter 1 of the revised title.

    In paragraph (3), references to the territories and possessions of the United States are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “United States” in chapter 1 of the revised title.

    In paragraph (5), the words “individual on a vessel insurable under this section” are substituted for “masters, officers, and crews of such vessels, and of other persons transported on such vessels” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In paragraph (6), the words “individual on a vessel insurable under this section” are substituted for “Masters, officers, members of the crews of such vessels and other persons employed or transported thereon” to eliminate unnecessary words.
