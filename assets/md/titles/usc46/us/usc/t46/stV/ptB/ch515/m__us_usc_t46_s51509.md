The Secretary shall allocate payments under this section among the various State maritime academies in an equitable manner.

    (b)  __Payments__  __.—__ 

    Payments under an agreement under this section shall be equal to $8,000 each academic year and be paid in such installments as the Secretary shall determine while the individual is attending the academy, as prescribed by the Secretary. The payments shall be used for uniforms, tuition, books, and subsistence.

    (c)  __Enlisted Reserve Status__  __.—__ 

    An agreement under this section shall require the student to accept enlisted reserve status in the Navy Reserve (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, Navy Reserve) or the Coast Guard Reserve before receiving any payments under the agreement.

    (d)  __Agreement Requirements__  __.—__ 

    An agreement under this section shall require the student to—

        (3) maintain a valid license as an officer in the merchant marine of the United States for at least 6 years after graduation from the academy, accompanied by the appropriate national and international endorsements and certification required by the Coast Guard for service aboard vessels on domestic and international voyages;

        (4) accept, if tendered, an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Navy Reserve (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, Navy Reserve), the Coast Guard Reserve, or any other reserve unit of an armed force of the United States, and, if tendered the appointment, to serve for at least 6 years after graduation from the academy;

        (5)

            (B) as an employee in a United States maritime-related industry, profession, or marine science (as determined by the Secretary), if the Secretary determines that service under subparagraph (A) is not available to the individual;

            (C) as a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed force of the United States, as a commissioned officer in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or in other maritime-related Federal employment which serves the national security interests of the United States, as determined by the Secretary; or

        (6) report to the Secretary on compliance with this subsection.

    (e)  __Failure To Complete Course of Instruction__  __.—__

In cases of hardship as determined by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation may waive this paragraph in whole or in part.

        (2)  __Recovery of cost__  __.—__ 

        If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation may recover from the individual the amount of student incentive payments, plus interest and attorney fees. The Secretary may reduce the amount to be recovered to reflect partial performance of service obligations and other factors the Secretary determines merit a reduction.

    (f)  __Failure To Carry Out Other Requirements__  __.—__
