    Subsection (d) is substituted for “less depreciation based on a twenty-five year life” because of [section 9 of Public Law 86–518][/us/pl/86/518/s9] (June 12, 1960, [74 Stat. 217][/us/stat/74/217]), which provided that “Nothing in any amendment made by this Act \[including section 1 substituting ‘twenty-five’ for ‘twenty’ in 46 App. U.S.C. 1195\] shall operate or be interpreted to change from twenty to twenty-five years the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, relating to the commercial expectancy or period of depreciation of any tanker or other liquid bulk carrier.”
