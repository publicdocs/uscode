        (2) if the obligor creates an escrow fund under [section 53715 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s53715], the actual cost of the vessel.

    (b)  __Limitations on Amount Borrowed__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Except as otherwise provided, the principal amount of an obligation guaranteed under this chapter may not exceed 75 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, of the vessel used as security for the guarantee.

        (2)  __Certain approved vessels__  __.—__ 

        The principal amount may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost if—

            (A) the size and speed of the vessel are approved by the Secretary or Administrator;

            (B) the vessel is or would have been eligible for mortgage aid for construction under section 509 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or would have been eligible except that the vessel was built with a construction-differential subsidy and the subsidy has been repaid; and

            (C) the vessel is of a type described in that section for which the minimum down payment required by that section is 12.5 percent of the cost of the vessel.

        (3)  __Barges__  __.—__
