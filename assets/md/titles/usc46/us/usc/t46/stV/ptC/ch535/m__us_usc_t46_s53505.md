        (2) the amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 167][/us/usc/t26/s167]) for the taxable year for agreement vessels;

        (3) if the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (1), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from the disposition of an agreement vessel or from insurance or indemnity attributable to an agreement vessel; and

        (4) the receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund.

    (b) __Reductions for Lessees.—__ 

    For a lessee, the maximum amount that may be deposited for an agreement vessel under subsection (a)(2) for any period shall be reduced by any amount the owner is required or permitted, under the capital construction fund agreement, to deposit for that period for the vessel under subsection (a)(2).
