    In this section, the words “commercial vessels of the United States” are substituted for “United States-flag commercial vessels” for consistency in the revised title.

    In subsection (a)(1), before subparagraph (A), the text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1241f(a)(2)(A) and (B) is omitted as obsolete. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1241o to improve the organization and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(2), the words “the 12-month period beginning October 1 of each year” are substituted for “12 month periods commencing April 1, 1986, the 18-month period beginning April 1, 2002, and the 12-month period beginning October 1, 2003, and each year thereafter” to eliminate obsolete and unnecessary language.

    In subsection (c)(4), before subparagraph (A), the words “or instrumentality” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “agency” in chapter 1.
