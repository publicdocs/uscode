    In paragraph (1), the words “but only during the period the designation is in effect” are added for clarity.

    In paragraph (3), the words “created by the Act of May 13, 1954 ([33 U.S.C. 981][/us/usc/t33/s981] et seq.)” are omitted as unnecessary.

    The definition of “Secretary” in 46 App. U.S.C. 1241v(4) is omitted as unnecessary because the full title of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the Secretary is referred to in each section.
