## § 55106. Merchandise transferred between barges

    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    On terms and conditions the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe by regulation, the Secretary may suspend the application of [section 55102 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s55102] to the transportation of merchandise that is transferred, when moving in the foreign trade of the United States, from a barge certified by the owner or operator as designed specifically for carriage on a vessel and carried regularly on a vessel in foreign trade, to another such barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator. However, this subsection does not apply to transportation between the continental United States and noncontiguous States, territories, or possessions to which the coastwise laws apply.

    (b)  __Reciprocity Requirement for Foreign Vessels__  __.—__ 

    This section applies to a vessel of foreign registry only if the Secretary of Homeland Security finds, based on information from the Secretary of State, that the government of the nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States.

([Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304], § 8(c), Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1635][/us/stat/120/1635].)

    In subsection (a), the words “non-self-propelled” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “barge” in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words “between points in the United States” and “without regard to whether any such barge is under foreign registry or qualified to engage in the coastwise trade” are omitted as surplus.
