    In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words “by vessels of the United States not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade, or by vessels of foreign registry” are omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (4), the words “by the Secretary of the Treasury” are omitted as unnecessary because the section referred to provides who administers it.
