## § 55335. Revocations and terminations of designations

    (a) __Revocations.—__ 

    After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary of Transportation may revoke a designation of a vessel as an American Great Lakes vessel if the Secretary finds that—

        (1) the vessel does not meet a requirement for the designation;

        (2) the vessel has been operated in violation of this subchapter; or

        (3) the owner or operator of the vessel has violated an agreement made under [section 55332(b) of this title][/us/usc/t46/s55332/b].

    (b) __Terminations.—__ 

    On petition and a showing of good cause by the owner of a vessel, the Secretary may terminate the designation of a vessel as an American Great Lakes vessel. The Secretary may impose conditions in a termination order to prevent significant adverse effects on other operators of vessels of the United States.

    In subsection (a)(3), the words “construction and purchase” before “agreement” are omitted because the source provision for section 55332(b) of the revised title does not say anything about construction.

    In subsection (b), the words “vessels of the United States” are substituted for “United States-flag vessel” for consistency in the revised title.
