    The Secretary may guarantee the repayment of debt obligations issued by entities under this section. Debt obligations to be guaranteed may be issued by any entity that has been approved by the Secretary and has agreed with the Secretary to conditions the Secretary considers necessary for this section to achieve the objective of the program and to protect the interest of the United States.

    (c) __Requirements of Obligations.—__ 

    A debt obligation guaranteed under this section shall—

        (2) have the fishing fees established under the program paid into a separate subaccount of the fishing capacity reduction fund established under this section;

        (3) not exceed $100,000,000 in an unpaid principal amount outstanding at any one time for a program;

        (5) have as the exclusive source of repayment (subject to the second sentence of subsection (d)(2)) and as the exclusive payment security, the fishing fees established under the program; and

        (6) at the discretion of the Secretary be issued in the public market or sold to the Federal Financing Bank.

    (d) __Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__ 

        There is a separate account in the Treasury, known as the Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund. Within the Fund, at least one subaccount shall be established for each program into which shall be paid all fishing fees established under the program and other amounts authorized for the program.

        (2) __Availability of amounts.—__ 

        Amounts in the Fund shall be available, without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, to the Secretary to pay the cost of the program, including payments to financial institutions to pay debt obligations incurred by entities under this section. Funds available for this purpose from other amounts available for the program may also be used to pay those debt obligations.
