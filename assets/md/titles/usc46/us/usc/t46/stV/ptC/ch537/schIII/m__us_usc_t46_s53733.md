    In subsection (a)(2)(A)(i), the words “(as defined in title 1)” are omitted as unnecessary because chapter 1 of the revised title contains a title-wide definition of “vessel” that incorporates the definition in title 1, United States Code.

    In subsection (b), the words “and subject to the terms the Secretary shall be prescribe” are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of the revised title provides the Secretary authority to prescribe the terms. The words “Only a private shipyard is eligible to receive a guarantee” are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1280a to eliminate unnecessary words.
