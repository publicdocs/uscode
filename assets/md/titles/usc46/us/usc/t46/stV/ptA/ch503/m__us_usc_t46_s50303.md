    In subsection (a), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of law” are omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (1), the word “lands” is omitted as included in “real property”. In paragraph (2)(A), the word “promissory” is added for clarity. The words “hereby transferred”, referring to the transfer under the first sentence of section 202 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (repealed by [section 12(60)(A) of Public Law 97–31][/us/pl/97/31/s12/60/A]), are omitted as obsolete.

    Subsection (b) is substituted for “in accordance with good business methods and on such terms and conditions as he determines to effectuate the policy of this chapter” and “upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe in accordance with sound business practice” for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.

 __Amendments__ 

    2008—Subsec. (a)(1). [Pub. L. 110–181][/us/pl/110/181] inserted “vessels,” after “piers,” and substituted “control, except that the prior consent of the Secretary of Defense for such use shall be required with respect to any vessel in the Ready Reserve Force or in the National Defense Reserve Fleet which is maintained in a retention status for the Department of Defense;” for “control;”.
