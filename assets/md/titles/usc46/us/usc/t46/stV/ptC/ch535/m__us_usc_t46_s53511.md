    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    Except as provided in [section 53513 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s53513], a withdrawal from a fund that is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.

    (b)  __Order of Withdrawals__  __.—__

        (1) first from the ordinary income account;

        (2) second from the capital gain account; and

        (3) third from the capital account.

    (c)  __Tax Treatment__  __.—__ 

    For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ([26 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t26/s1] et seq.)—

        (1) a nonqualified withdrawal from the ordinary income account shall be included in income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made;

        (2) a nonqualified withdrawal from the capital gain account shall be included in income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made as an item of gain realized during that year from the disposition of an asset held for more than 6 months; and

        (3)

         for the period through the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made—

            (A) no interest shall be payable under section 6601 of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 6601][/us/usc/t26/s6601]) and no addition to the tax shall be payable under section 6651 of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 6651][/us/usc/t26/s6651]);

            (B) interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable to an amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal from the ordinary income account or the capital gain account shall be paid at the rate determined under subsection (d) from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for which the amount was deposited in the fund; and

        (2)  __Earnings__  __.—__ 

        The earnings of a capital construction fund for any taxable year (except net gains) shall be treated under this subsection as an amount deposited for the taxable year.

        (3)  __Contract for qualified withdrawal__  __.—__ 

        Under paragraph (1), an amount shall not be treated as remaining in a capital construction fund at the close of a taxable year to the extent there is a binding contract at the close of the taxable year for a qualified withdrawal of the amount for an identified item for which the withdrawal may be made.

        (4)  __Excess earnings__  __.—__ 

        If the Secretary determines that the balance in a capital construction fund exceeds the amount appropriate to meet the vessel construction program objectives of the person that established the fund, the amount of the excess shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under paragraph (1) unless the person develops appropriate program objectives within 3 years to dissipate the excess.

        (5)  __Amounts in fund on __  __january 1, 1987__  __.—__ 

        Under this subsection, amounts in a capital construction fund on January 1, 1987, shall be treated as having been deposited in that fund on that date.

    (f)  __Tax Determinations__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        For a taxable year for which there is a nonqualified withdrawal (including an amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under subsection (e)), the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) shall be determined by—

            (A) excluding the withdrawal from gross income; and

            (B) increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 of such Code by the product of the amount of the withdrawal and the highest tax rate specified in section 1 (or section 11 for a corporation) of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 1][/us/usc/t26/s1], 11).

        (2)  __Maximum tax rate__  __.—__ 

        For that portion of a nonqualified withdrawal made from the capital gain account during a taxable year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a) of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 1(h)][/us/usc/t26/s1/h], 1201(a)) applies, the tax rate used under paragraph (1)(B) may not exceed 20 percent (or 34 percent for a corporation).

        (3)  __Tax benefit rule__  __.—__ 

        If any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (except earnings on deposits) made by the taxpayer in a taxable year that did not reduce the taxpayer’s liability for tax under chapter 1 of such Code (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) for a taxable year before the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs—

            (A) that portion shall not be taken into account under paragraph (1); and

            (B) an amount equal to that portion shall be allowed as a deduction under section 172 of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 172][/us/usc/t26/s172]) for the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs.

        (4)  __Coordination with deduction for net operating losses__  __.—__ 

        A nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under paragraph (1) shall be excluded in determining taxable income under section 172(b)(2) of such Code ([26 U.S.C. 172(b)(2)][/us/usc/t26/s172/b/2]).
