## § 55104. Transportation of passengers between Puerto Rico and other ports in the United States

    (a)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

    In this section:

        (1)  __Certificate__  __.—__ 

        The term “certificate” means a certificate of financial responsibility for indemnification of passengers for nonperformance of transportation issued by the Federal Maritime Commission under [section 44102 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s44102].

        (2)  __Passenger vessel__  __.—__ 

        The term “passenger vessel” means a vessel of similar size, or offering similar service, as any other vessel transporting passengers under subsection (b).

    (b)  __Exemption__  __.—__ 

    Except as otherwise provided in this section, a vessel not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade may transport passengers between a port in Puerto Rico and another port in the United States.

    (c)  __Expiration of Exemption__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __When coastwise-qualified vessel offering service__  __.—__ 

        On a showing to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, by the vessel owner or charterer, that a United States passenger vessel qualified to engage in the coastwise trade is offering or advertising passenger service between a port in Puerto Rico and another port in the United States pursuant to a certificate, the Secretary shall notify the owner or operator of each vessel transporting passengers under subsection (b) to terminate that transportation within 270 days after the Secretary’s notification. Except as provided in subsection (d), the authority to transport passengers under subsection (b) expires at the end of that 270-day period.

        (2)  __When non-coastwise-qualified vessel offering service__  __.—__ 

        On a showing to the Secretary, by the vessel owner or charterer, that a United States passenger vessel not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade is offering or advertising passenger service between a port in Puerto Rico and another port in the United States pursuant to a certificate, the Secretary shall notify the owner or operator of each foreign vessel transporting passengers under subsection (b) to terminate that transportation within 270 days after the Secretary’s notification. Except as provided in subsection (d), the authority of a foreign vessel to transport passengers under subsection (b) expires at the end of that 270-day period.

    (d)  __Delaying Expiration__  __.—__ 

    If the vessel offering or advertising the service described in subsection (c) has not begun that service within 270 days after the Secretary’s notification, the expiration provided by subsection (c) is delayed until 90 days after the vessel offering or advertising the service begins that service.

    (e)  __Reinstatement of Exemption__  __.—__ 

    If the Secretary finds that the service on which an expiration was based is no longer available, the expired authority to transport passengers is reinstated.

    In subsection (a), the definition of “certificate” is added based on the language in 46 App. U.S.C. 289c(b)(1) and (2) to avoid repeating the substance of the definition twice in the section.

    In subsection (b), the words “Notwithstanding any other provision of law” and “directly or by way of a foreign port” are omitted as unnecessary.
