    In subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security is substituted for the Commissioner of Customs because the functions of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ([Pub. L. 107–296][/us/pl/107/296], [116 Stat. 2178][/us/stat/116/2178]). The functions of the Commissioner of Customs previously were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury under [section 321(c) of title 31][/us/usc/t31/s321/c]. For prior related transfers of functions, see the transfer of functions note under 46 App. U.S.C. 289a.
