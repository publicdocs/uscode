## § 56303. Compensation

    (a) __In General.—__ 

    As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Transportation shall determine and pay just compensation for a vessel requisitioned under this chapter.

    (b) __Factors Not Affecting Value.—__ 

    The value of a vessel may not be considered enhanced by the circumstances requiring its requisition. Consequential damages arising from the requisition may not be paid.

    (c) __Effect of Construction-Differential Subsidy.—__ 

        (1) __If paid.—__ 

        If a construction-differential subsidy has been paid for the vessel, the value of the vessel at the time of requisition shall be determined under section 802 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936.

        (2) __If not paid.—__ 

        If a construction-differential subsidy has not been paid for the vessel, the value of any national defense features previously paid for by the United States Government shall be excluded.

    (d) __Loss or Damage During Charter.—__ 

    If a vessel is lost or damaged by a risk assumed by the Government under the charter, but a valuation for the vessel or a means of compensation has not been agreed to, the Secretary shall pay just compensation for the loss or damage, to the extent the person is not reimbursed through insurance.
