    In subsection (a), the words “vessel acquired by the Maritime Administration” are subtituted for “vessel heretofore or hereafter acquired under this section, or otherwise acquired by the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation under any other authority” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (b), the words “except as provided in section 57102, 57103, or 57104 or chapter 533, 537, 573, or 575 of this title” are substituted for “except as provided for in subsections (g) and (i) of this section. This limitation shall not affect the rights of the Secretary of Transportation to dispose of a vessel as provided in other sections of this subchapter or in subchapters VII or XI of this chapter” because of the restatement.
