    The definition of “Secretary” is omitted as unnecessary because the full title is used the first time the term appears in each section.

    In the definition of “merchant marine office”, the words “documented vessel” are substituted for “vessel . . . which is documented under the laws of the United States” because of the definition of “documented vessel” in [46 U.S.C. 2101][/us/usc/t46/s2101], which is being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title.

    In the definition of “State maritime academy”, the words “or territory of the United States” and “or territories of the United States” are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “State” in chapter 1 of the revised title.
