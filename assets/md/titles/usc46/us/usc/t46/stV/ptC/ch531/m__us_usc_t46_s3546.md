After such minimum manning and wage scales, and working conditions shall have been adopted by the Secretary of Transportation, no change shall be made therein by the Secretary of Transportation except upon public notice of the hearing to be had, and a hearing by the Secretary of Transportation of all interested parties, under such rules as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe. The duly elected representatives of the organizations certified as the proper collective bargaining agencies shall have the right to represent the employees who are members of their organizations at any such hearings. Every contractor receiving an operating-differential subsidy shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on each such vessel operated by such contractor a printed copy of the minimum manning and wage scales, and working conditions prescribed by his contract and applicable to such vessel: Provided, however, That any increase in the operating expenses of the subsidized vessel occasioned by any change in the wage or manning scales or working conditions as provided in this section shall be added to the operating-differential subsidy previously authorized for the vessel.

 __Construction-Differential Subsidy__ 

[Act June 29, 1936, ch. 858][/us/act/1936-06-29/ch858], title V, [49 Stat. 1995][/us/stat/49/1995], as amended, provided as follows:

 __Subsidy Authorized for Vessels To Be Operated in Foreign Trade__ 

    “Sec. 501. (a) Any proposed ship purchaser who is a citizen of the United States or any shipyard of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for a construction-differential subsidy to aid in the construction of a new vessel to be used in the foreign commerce of the United States. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the plans and specifications call for a new vessel which will meet the requirements of the foreign commerce of the United States, will aid in the promotion and development of such commerce, and be suitable for use by the United States for national defense or military purposes in time of war or national emergency; (2) if the applicant is the proposed ship purchaser, the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the proposed new vessel, and (3) the granting of the aid applied for is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\]. The contract of sale, and the mortgage given to secure the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price shall not restrict the lawful or proper use or operation of the vessel except to the extent expressly required by law. The Secretary of Transportation may give preferred consideration to applications that will tend to reduce construction-differential subsidies and that propose the construction of ships of higher transport capability and productivity.

    “(b) The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and specifications for the proposed vessel to the Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestions for such changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that such vessel shall be suitable for economical and speedy conversion into a naval or military auxiliary, or otherwise suitable for the use of the United States Government in time of war or national emergency. If the Secretary of the Navy approves such plans and specifications as submitted, or as modified, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of Transportation.

    “(c) Any citizen of the United States or any shipyard of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for a construction-differential subsidy to aid in reconstructing or reconditioning any vessel that is to be used in the foreign commerce of the United States. If the Secretary of Transportation, in the exercise of his discretion, shall determine that the granting of the financial aid applied for is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such application and enter into a contract or contracts with the applicant therefor providing for the payment by the United States of a construction-differential subsidy that is to be ascertained, determined, controlled, granted, and paid, subject to all the applicable conditions and limitations of this title and under such further conditions and limitations as may be prescribed in the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Transportation has adopted as provided in section 204(b) of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1114(b), repealed by [Pub. L. 109–304, § 19][/us/pl/109/304/s19], Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1710][/us/stat/120/1710]\]; but the financial aid authorized by this subsection shall be extended to reconstruction or reconditioning only in exceptional cases and after a thorough study and a formal determination by the Secretary of Transportation that the proposed reconstruction or reconditioning is consistent with the purposes and policy of this Act.”

    (As amended [June 23, 1938, ch. 600, § 8][/us/act/1938-06-23/ch600/s8], [52 Stat. 955][/us/stat/52/955]; [July 17, 1952, ch. 939][/us/act/1952-07-17/ch939], §§ 1, 2, [66 Stat. 760][/us/stat/66/760], 761; [Pub. L. 91–469][/us/pl/91/469], §§ 6, 35(a), (c), (d), Oct. 21, 1970, [84 Stat. 1019][/us/stat/84/1019], 1035; [Pub. L. 91–603, § 4(a)][/us/pl/91/603/s4/a], Dec. 31, 1970, [84 Stat. 1675][/us/stat/84/1675]; [Pub. L. 97–31, § 12(84)][/us/pl/97/31/s12/84], Aug. 6, 1981, [95 Stat. 161][/us/stat/95/161].)

 __Construction of Vessels; Bids; Subsidies__ 

    “Sec. 502. (a) If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his approval under section 501(b) of this Act, and the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans and specifications. If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel, and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 505 of this Act with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect. Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.

    “(b) The amount of the reduction in selling price which is herein termed ‘construction differential subsidy’ shall equal, but not exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed. The Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions. The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements. The Secretary’s consideration shall include, but not be limited to, all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his determination. The construction differential approved and paid by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence of section 505) for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less. In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House, respectively.

    “(c) In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the purchaser. The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the same proportion as provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation. The purchaser shall pay, not less frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation’s payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser’s portion of the price of the vessel (after deduction of the purchaser’s cash payments) at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs. The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser, within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser. Interest at the rate per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the purchaser’s portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.

    “(d) \[Repealed. [Pub. L. 87–877, § 2(a)][/us/pl/87/877/s2/a], Oct. 24, 1962, [76 Stat. 1200][/us/stat/76/1200].\]

    “(e) If no bids are received for the construction, outfitting, or equipping of such vessel, or if it appears to the Secretary of Transportation that the bids received from privately owned shipyards of the United States are collusive, excessive, or unreasonable, and if a citizen of the United States agrees to purchase said vessel as provided in this section, then, to provide employment for citizens of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation may have such vessel constructed, outfitted, or equipped at not in excess of the actual cost thereof in a navy yard of the United States under such regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Transportation. In such event the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay for any such vessel so constructed from his construction fund. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell any vessel so constructed, outfitted, or equipped in a navy yard to a citizen of the United States for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof less the equivalent to the construction differential subsidy determined as provided by subsection (b), such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this title.

    “(f) The Secretary of Transportation, with the advice of and in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, shall at least once each year, as required for purposes of this Act, survey the existing privately owned shipyards capable of merchant ship construction, or review available data on such shipyards if deemed adequate, to determine whether their capabilities for merchant ship construction, including facilities and skilled personnel, provide an adequate mobilization base at strategic points for purposes of national defense and national emergency. The Secretary of Transportation, in connection with ship construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under titles V and VII \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1191 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], upon a basis of a finding that the award of the proposed construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling work will remedy an existing or impending inadequacy in such mobilization base as to the capabilities and capacities of a shipyard or shipyards at a strategic point, and after taking into consideration the benefits accruing from standardized construction, the conditions of unemployment, and the needs and reasonable requirements of all shipyards, may allocate such construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling to such yard or yards in such manner as he may determine to be fair, just, and reasonable to all sections of the country, subject to the provisions of this subsection. In the allocation of construction work to such yards as herein provided, the Secretary of Transportation may, after first obtaining competitive bids for such work in compliance with the provisions of this Act, negotiate with the bidders and with other shipbuilders concerning the terms and conditions of any contract for such work, and is authorized to enter into such contract at a price deemed by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable. Any contract entered into by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Act, excepting those pertaining to the awarding of contracts to the lowest bidder which are inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection. In the event that a contract is made providing for a price in excess of the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, such excess shall be paid by the Secretary of Transportation as a part of the cost of national defense, and shall not be considered as a part of the construction-differential subsidy. In the event that a contract is made providing for a price lower than the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, the construction-differential subsidy shall be computed on the contract price in lieu of such bid.

    “If, as a result of allocation under this subsection, the purchaser incurs expenses for inspection and supervision of the vessel during construction and for the delivery voyage of the vessel in excess of the estimated expenses for the same services that he would have incurred if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to construction under title V, except section 509) shall reimburse the purchaser for such excess, less one-half of any gross income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income, and such reimbursement shall not be considered part of the construction-differential subsidy: Provided, That no interest shall be paid on any refund authorized under this Act. If the vessel is constructed under section 509 the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess, less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage. In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading. In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service. In either case, however, the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder. If as a result of such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-differential subsidy.

    “(g) Upon the application of any citizen of the United States to purchase any vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of section 215 \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1125, see [46 U.S.C. 57105][/us/usc/t46/s57105]\], the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell such vessel to the applicant for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof to the Secretary of Transportation less depreciation at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of completion, excluding the cost of national-defense features added by the Secretary of Transportation, less the equivalent of any applicable construction-differential subsidy as provided by subsection (b), such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this title. Such vessel shall thereupon be eligible for an operating-differential subsidy under title VI of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1171 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], notwithstanding the provisions of section 601(a)(1), and section 610(1) \[set out below\], or any other provision of law.

    “(h) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to construct, purchase, lease, acquire, store, maintain, sell, or otherwise dispose of national defense features intended for installation on vessels. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to install or remove such national defense features on any vessel (1) which is in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as defined by section 11(a) of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 \[[50 U.S.C. 4405(a)][/us/usc/t50/s4405/a]\], (2) which is requisitioned, purchased, or chartered under section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1242, now [46 U.S.C. 56301][/us/usc/t46/s56301] et seq.\], (3) which serves as security for the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary of Transportation under title XI of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1271 et seq., see [46 U.S.C. 53701][/us/usc/t46/s53701] et seq.\], or (4) which is the subject of an agreement between the owner of such vessel and the Secretary of Transportation to install or remove such national defense features. Title to such national defense features which the Secretary of Transportation determines are not to be permanently incorporated in a vessel shall not be affected by such installation or removal unless otherwise transferred in accordance with the provisions of this title V.

    “(i) The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and specifications for such national defense features and the proposals for their acquisition, storage, utilization, or disposition to the Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestion for such changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that such features shall be suitable for the use of the United States Government in time of war or national emergency. If the Secretary of the Navy approves such plans, specifications, or proposals as submitted, or as modified in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of Transportation.”

 __Documentation of Completed Vessel Under Laws of United States; Delivery to Purchaser; First Mortgage to Secure Deferred Payments__ 

    “Sec. 503. Upon completion of the construction of any vessel in respect to which a construction-differential subsidy is to be allowed under this title and its delivery by the shipbuilder to the Secretary of Transportation, the vessel shall be documented under the laws of the United States, and concurrently therewith, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the vessel shall be delivered with a bill of sale to the purchaser with warranty against liens, pursuant to the contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation. The vessel shall remain documented under the laws of the United States for not less than twenty-five years, or so long as there remains due the United States any principal or interest on account of the purchaser price, whichever is the longer period. At the time of delivery of the vessel the purchaser shall execute and deliver a first-preferred mortgage to the United States to secure payment of any sums due from the purchaser in respect to said vessel: Provided, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the payment of any sums due in respect to a passenger vessel purchased under section 4(b) of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 \[former 50 U.S.C. App. 1737(b)\], reconverted or restored for normal operation in commercial services, or in respect to a passenger vessel purchased under title V of this Act, which is delivered subsequent to March 8, 1946, and which (i) is of not less than ten thousand gross tons, (ii) has a designed speed approved by the Secretary of Transportation but not less than eighteen knots, (iii) has accommodations for not less than two hundred passengers, and, (iv) is approved by the Secretary of Defense as being desirable for national defense purposes, may, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation be secured only by a first-preferred mortgage on said vessel. With the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, such preferred mortgage may provide that the sole recourse against the purchaser of such a passenger vessel under such mortgage, and any of the notes secured thereby, shall be limited to repossession of the vessel by the United States and the assignment of insurance claims, if the purchaser shall have complied with all provisions of the mortgage other than those relating to the payment of principal and interest when due, and the obligation of the purchaser shall be satisfied and discharged by the surrender of the vessel, and all right, title, and interest therein to the United States. Such vessel upon surrender shall be (i) free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except the lien of the preferred mortgage, (ii) in class, and (iii) in as good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, as when acquired by the purchaser, except that any deficiencies with respect to freedom from encumbrances, condition, and class, may, to the extent covered by valid policies of insurance, be satisfied by the assignment to the United States of claims of the purchaser under such policies of insurance. The purchaser shall also comply with all the provisions of section 9 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 868, repealed by [Pub.

 __Purchase of Vessel Constructed in Accordance With Application for Subsidy; Bid or Negotiated Price Basis for Subsidy and Payments for Cost of National Defense Features; Documentation__ 

    “Sec. 504. If a qualified purchaser under the terms of this title desires to purchase a vessel to be constructed in accordance with an application for construction-differential subsidy under this title, the Secretary of Transportation may, in lieu of contracting to pay the entire cost of the vessel under section 502, contract to pay only construction-differential subsidy and the cost of national defense features to the shipyard constructing such vessel. The construction-differential subsidy and payments for the cost of national defense features shall be based upon the lowest responsible domestic bid unless the vessel is constructed at a negotiated price as provided by section 502(a) or under a contract negotiated by the Secretary of Transportation as provided in section 502(b) in which event the construction-differential subsidy and payments for the cost of national defense features shall be based upon such negotiated price. No construction-differential subsidy, as provided in this section, shall be paid unless the said contract or contracts or other arrangements contain such provisions as are provided in this title to protect the interests of the United States as the Secretary of Transportation deems necessary. Such vessel shall be documented under the laws of the United States as provided in [section 503 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s503]. The contract of sale, and the mortgage given to secure the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price, shall not restrict the lawful or proper use or operation of the vessel, except to the extent expressly required by law.”

All construction in respect of which a construction-differential subsidy is allowed under this title shall be performed in a shipyard of the United States as the result of competitive bidding, after due advertisement, with the right reserved in the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove, any or all bids. In all such construction the shipbuilder, subcontractors, materialmen, or suppliers shall use, so far as practicable, only articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, or manufacture of the United States as defined in paragraph K of section 401 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \[now [19 U.S.C. 1401(h)][/us/usc/t19/s1401/h]\]; Provided, however, That with respect to other than major components of the hull, superstructure, and any material used in the construction thereof, (1) if the Secretary of Transportation determines that the requirements of this sentence will unreasonably delay completion of any vessel beyond its contract delivery date, and (2) if such determination includes or is accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis therefor, then the Secretary of Transportation may waive such requirements to the extent necessary to prevent such delay. No shipbuilder shall be deemed a responsible bidder unless he possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, equipment, and other qualifications necessary properly to perform the proposed contract. Each bid submitted to the Secretary of Transportation shall be accompanied by all detailed estimates upon which it is based. The Secretary of Transportation may require that the bids of any subcontractors, or other pertinent data, accompany such bid. All such bids and data relating thereto shall be kept on file until disposed of as provided by law. For the purposes of this title V, the term ‘shipyard of the United States’ means shipyards within any of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”

 __Operation of Subsidy Constructed Vessel Limited to Foreign Trade; Repayments to Secretary for Deviations__ 

    “Sec. 506. Every owner of a vessel for which a construction-differential subsidy has been paid shall agree that the vessel shall be operated exclusively in foreign trade, or on a round-the-world voyage, or on a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or on a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territory of the United States, and that if the vessel is operated in the domestic trade on any of the above-enumerated services, he will pay annually to the Secretary of Transportation that proportion of one-twenty-fifth of the construction-differential subsidy paid for such vessel as the gross revenue derived from the domestic trade bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyages completed during the preceding year. The Secretary may consent in writing to the temporary transfer of such vessel to service other than the service covered by such agreement for periods not exceeding six months in any year, whenever the Secretary may determine that such transfer is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\]. Such consent shall be conditioned upon the agreement by the owner to pay to the Secretary, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, an amount which bears the same proportion to the construction-differential subsidy paid by the Secretary as such temporary period bears to the entire economic life of the vessel. No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of such vessel for such temporary period.”

    “Sec. 507. If a contract is made by the Secretary of Transportation under authority of this title for the construction and sale of a new vessel to replace a vessel then operated in foreign trade or domestic trade, which in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation should be replaced because it is obsolete or inadequate for successful operation in such trade, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized, in his discretion, to buy such replaced vessel from the owner at a fair and reasonable valuation, which valuation shall not exceed the cost to the owner or any former owner plus the actual cost previously expended thereon for reconditioning, and less a reasonable and proper depreciation, based upon not more than twenty-five-year life of the vessel, and apply the purchase price agreed upon to that portion of the construction cost of such new vessel which is to be borne by the purchaser thereof: Provided, That the owner of such replaced vessel shall execute a bond, with one or more approved sureties, conditioned upon indemnifying the United States from all loss resulting from any existing lien against such vessel: And provided further, That such vessel has been documented under the laws of the United States for a period of at least ten years prior to the date of its purchase by the United States.”

[Act June 29, 1936, ch. 858][/us/act/1936-06-29/ch858], title VI, [49 Stat. 2001][/us/stat/49/2001], as amended, provided as follows:

 __Subtitle A—Operating-Differential Subsidy Program__ 

 __Subsidy Authorized for Operation of Vessels in Foreign Trade or in Off-Season Cruises__ 

    “Sec. 601. (a) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels, which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613]. In this title VI the term ‘essential service’ means the operation of a vessel on a service, route, or line described in section 211(a) \[now [46 U.S.C. 50103(a)(1)][/us/usc/t46/s50103/a/1]\] or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section 211(b) \[now [46 U.S.C. 50103(b)][/us/usc/t46/s50103/b]\]. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613], and that such vessel or vessels were built in the United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and under construction for the account of citizens of the United States prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size, type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\]. To the extent the application covers cruises, as authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613], the Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag cruise from the United States competes with any American flag cruise from the United States.

    “(b) Every application for an operating-differential subsidy under the provisions of this title shall be accompanied by statements disclosing the names of all persons having any pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in such application, or in the ownership or use of the vessel or vessels, routes, or lines covered thereby, and the nature and extent of any such interest, together with such financial and other statements as may be required by the Secretary of Transportation. All such statements shall be under oath or affirmation and in such form as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe. Any person who, in an application for financial aid under this title or in any statement required to be filed therewith, willfully makes any untrue statement of a material fact, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.”

    (As amended [Pub. L. 87–45, § 2][/us/pl/87/45/s2], May 27, 1961, [75 Stat. 90][/us/stat/75/90]; [Pub. L. 91–469][/us/pl/91/469], §§ 14, 35(a), (h), Oct. 21, 1970, [84 Stat. 1023][/us/stat/84/1023], 1035, 1036; [Pub. L. 91–603, § 4(c)][/us/pl/91/603/s4/c], (d), Dec. 31, 1970, [84 Stat. 1675][/us/stat/84/1675]; [Pub. L. 97–31, § 12(93)][/us/pl/97/31/s12/93], Aug. 6, 1981, [95 Stat. 161][/us/stat/95/161].)

 __Determination of Necessity of Subsidy To Meet Competition__ 

    “Sec. 602. Except with respect to cruises authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613], no contract for an operating-differential subsidy shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation for the operation of a vessel or vessels to meet foreign competition, except direct foreign-flag competition, until and unless the Secretary of Transportation, after a full and complete investigation and hearing, shall determine that an operating-differential subsidy is necessary to meet competition of foreign-flag ships.”

    (As amended [June 23, 1938, ch. 600, § 40(b)][/us/act/1938-06-23/ch600/s40/b], [52 Stat. 964][/us/stat/52/964]; [Pub. L. 87–45, § 3][/us/pl/87/45/s3], May 27, 1961, [75 Stat. 91][/us/stat/75/91]; [Pub. L. 91–469, § 35(a)][/us/pl/91/469/s35/a], Oct. 21, 1970, [84 Stat. 1035][/us/stat/84/1035]; [Pub. L. 97–31, § 12(94)][/us/pl/97/31/s12/94], Aug. 6, 1981, [95 Stat. 161][/us/stat/95/161].)

 __Contracts for Payment of Subsidy__ 

    “Sec. 603. (a) If the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, for the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service and in cruises authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613] for a period not exceeding twenty years, and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions, consistent with this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to effectuate the purposes and policy of this Act, including a performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required by the Secretary of Transportation.

“(b) Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger vessels, as defined in section 613 of this Act, maintenance, and repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated pursuant to the provisions of section 501(b) \[set out above\]) if such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract: Provided, however, That the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section 211(b) \[now [46 U.S.C. 50103(b)][/us/usc/t46/s50103/b]\], pay, in lieu of the operating-differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under the registry of a foreign country. For any period during which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 613 of this Act, operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel is assigned: Provided, however, That if the cruise vessel calls at a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 613 of this Act) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized operator regularly serving the area.

>     “(c)

>         (1)

>          When used in this section—

>             “(A)

>              The term ‘collective bargaining costs’ means the annual cost, calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense as of any date, of all items of expense required of the applicant through collective bargaining or other agreement, covering the employ of United States officers and crew of a vessel, including payments required by law to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits, or similar benefits and taxes or other governmental assessments on crew payrolls, but excluding subsistence of officers and crews on vessels other than passenger vessels as defined in section 613 of this Act and costs relating to:

>                 “(i) the officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to the award of a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel: Provided, That the Secretary of Transportation shall afford representatives of the collective-bargaining unit or units responsible for the manning of the vessel an opportunity to comment on such finding prior to the effective date of such finding: And provided further, That in determining whether officers or members of the crew are necessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel, the Secretary of Transportation shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, wage and manning scales and working conditions required by a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement, or

>                 “(ii) those officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to ninety days following the date of enactment of this subsection \[Oct. 21, 1970\], to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of the vessel.

>             “(B) The term ‘base period costs’ means for the base period beginning July 1, 1970, and ending June 30, 1971, the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1, 1971, less all other items of cost that have been disallowed by the Secretary of Transportation prior to ninety days following the date of enactment of this subsection \[Oct. 21, 1970\], and not already excluded from collective-bargaining costs under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii) of this subsection. In any subsequent base period the term ‘base period costs’ means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: Provided, That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the difference between the base period cost and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base period.

>             “(C) The term ‘base period’ means any annual period beginning July 1, and ending June 30 with respect to which a base period cost is established.

>             “(D) The term ‘subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews’ in any period other than a base period means the most recent base period costs increased or decreased by the increase or decrease from January 1 of such base period to January 1 of such period in the index described in subdivision (3) hereof, and with respect to a base period means the base period cost. The subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-bargaining costs.

>         “(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the collective-bargaining costs on ships in subsidized operation as of January 1, 1971, and as of each January 1 thereafter, and shall as of intervals of not less than two years nor more than four years, establish a new base period cost, except that the Secretary shall not establish a new base period unless he announces his intention to do so prior to the December 31 that would be included in the new base period.

>         “(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall compile the index referred to in subdivision (1). Such index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural industries other than transportation. Such index shall be based on the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining. Such materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to disclosure.

>     “(d) Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in timely fashion all relevant data within his possession. In making the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his request or on his behalf. Such foreign cost data shall be made available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining such data in the future. In determining foreign manning for purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined until the beginning of a new base period.

>     “(e) The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month, upon the contractor’s certification that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the month. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe procedures for the calculation and payment of subsidy on items of expense which are included in ‘collective-bargaining costs’ but are not included in the daily rate because they are unpredictably timed.

>     “(f) Ninety percent of the amount of the insurance and maintenance and repair and subsistence of officers and crews subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month on the basis of the subsidy estimated to have accrued with respect to such voyages. Any such payment shall be made only after there has been furnished to the Secretary of Transportation such security as he deems to be reasonable and necessary to assure refund of any overpayment. The contractor and the Secretary of Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as practicable after such payment. The remaining 10 percent of such subsidy shall be payable after such audit.”

 __Additional Subsidy; When Authorized__ 

    “Sec. 604. If in the case of any particular foreign-trade route the Secretary of Transportation shall find after consultation with the Secretary of State, that the subsidy provided for in this title is in any respect inadequate to offset the effect of governmental aid paid to foreign competitors, he may grant such additional subsidy as he determines to be necessary for that purpose.”

    (As amended [June 23, 1938, ch. 600, § 21][/us/act/1938-06-23/ch600/s21], [52 Stat. 959][/us/stat/52/959]; [Aug. 4, 1939, ch. 417, § 9][/us/act/1939-08-04/ch417/s9], [53 Stat. 1185][/us/stat/53/1185]; [Pub.

 __Vessels Excluded From Subsidy__ 

    “Sec. 605. (a) No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of any vessel on a voyage on which it engages in coastwise or intercoastal trade: Provided, however, That such subsidy may be paid on a round-the-world voyage or a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States or a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territory of the United States, and if the subsidized vessel earns any gross revenue on the carriage of mail, passengers, or cargo by reason of such coastal or intercoastal trade the subsidy payment for the entire voyage shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the subsidy otherwise payable as such gross revenue bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyage. No vessel operating on the inland waterways of the United States shall be considered for the purposes of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\] to be operating in foreign trade.

    “(b) No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of a vessel after the calendar year the vessel becomes 25 years of age, unless the Secretary of Transportation has determined, before the date of enactment of the Maritime Security Act of 1996 \[Oct. 8, 1996\], that it is in the public interest to grant such financial aid for the operation of such vessel.

    “(c) No contract shall be made under this title with respect to a vessel to be operated in an essential service served by citizens of the United States which would be in addition to the existing service, or services, unless the Secretary of Transportation shall determine after proper hearing of all parties that the service already provided by vessels of United States registry is inadequate, and that in the accomplishment of the purposes and policy of this Act additional vessels should be operated thereon; and no contract shall be made with respect to a vessel operated or to be operated in an essential service served by two or more citizens of the United States with vessels of United States registry, if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine the effect of such a contract would be to give undue advantage or be unduly prejudicial, as between citizens of the United States, in the operation of vessels in such essential service unless following public hearing, due notice of which shall be given to each operator serving such essential service, the Secretary of Transportation shall find that it is necessary to enter into such contract in order to provide adequate service by vessels of United States registry. The Secretary of Transportation in determining for the purposes of this section whether services are competitive, shall take into consideration the type, size, and speed of the vessels employed, whether passenger or cargo, or combination passenger and cargo, vessels, the ports or ranges between which they run, the character of cargo carried, and such other facts as he may deem proper.”

 __Readjustments; Change in Service; Withdrawal From Service; Payment of Excess Profits; Wages, Etc.; American Materials__ 

    “Sec. 606. Every contract for an operating-differential subsidy under this title shall provide (1) that the amount of the future payments to the contractor shall be subject to review and readjustment from time to time, but not more frequently than once a year, at the instance of the Secretary of Transportation or of the contractor. If any such readjustment cannot be reached by mutual agreement, the Secretary of Transportation, on his own motion or on the application of the contractor, shall, after a proper hearing, determine the facts and make such readjustment in the amount of such future payments as he may determine to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. The testimony in every such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Secretary of Transportation. His decision shall be based upon and governed by the changes which may have occurred since the date of the said contract, with respect to the items theretofore considered and on which such contract was based, and other conditions affecting shipping, and shall be promulgated in a formal order, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing in which the Secretary of Transportation shall state his findings of fact; (2) that the compensation to be paid under it shall be reduced, under such terms and in such amounts as the Secretary of Transportation shall determine, for any periods in which the vessel or vessels are laid up; (3) that if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine that a change in an essential service, which is receiving an operating-differential subsidy under this title, is necessary in the accomplishment of the purposes of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], it may make such change upon such readjustment of payments to the contractor as shall be arrived at by the method prescribed in clause (1) of these conditions; (4) that if at any time the contractor receiving an operating-differential subsidy claims that he cannot maintain and operate his vessels in such an essential service, with a reasonable profit upon his investment, and applies to the Secretary of Transportation for a modification or rescission of his contract to maintain such essential service, and the Secretary of Transportation determines that such claim is proved the Secretary of Transportation shall modify or rescind such contract and permit the contractor to withdraw such vessels from such essential service upon a date fixed by the Secretary of Transportation, and upon the date of such withdrawal the further payment of the operating differential subsidy shall cease and the contractor be discharged from any further obligation under such contract; (5) that the contractor shall conduct his operations with respect to essential services and any services authorized under [section 613 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s613], covered by his contract in an economical and efficient manner, and (6) that whenever practicable, an operator who receives subsidy with respect to subsistence of officers and crews shall use as such subsistence items only articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, and manufacture of the United States, as defined in section 505 herein \[set out above\], except when it is necessary to purchase supplies outside the United States to enable such vessel to continue and complete her voyage, and an operator who receives subsidy with respect to repairs shall perform such repairs within any of the United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except in an emergency.”

 __Sale or Assignment of Contract; Consent of Secretary; Purchaser Subject to Terms of Contract; Rescinding Contract on Transfer Without Consent__ 

    “Sec. 608. No contract executed under this title or any interest therein shall be sold, assigned, or transferred, either directly or indirectly, or through any reorganization, merger, or consolidation, nor shall any agreement or arrangement be made by the holder whereby the maintenance, management, or operation of the service, route, line, vessel, or vessels is to be performed by any other person, without the written consent of the Secretary of Transportation. If he consents to such agreement or arrangement, the agreement or arrangement shall make provision whereby the person undertaking such maintenance, management, or operation agrees to be bound by all of the provisions of the contract and of this Act \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\] applicable thereto, and the rules and regulations prescribed pursuant to this Act.

 __Withholding Payment to Defaulting Contractor__ 

    “Sec. 609. The Secretary of Transportation shall withhold the payment of operating-differential subsidy while any contractor therefor is in default in any payments due on account of construction-loan, ship-sales mortgage notes, or any other obligation due the United States, and shall apply the amount so withheld to the satisfaction of such debt.”

 __Transfer of Vessels to Foreign Registry on Default of United States__ 

    “Sec. 611. (a) The contractor, upon compliance with the provisions of this section, may transfer to foreign registry the vessels covered by any operating-differential subsidy contract held by him, in the event that the United States defaults upon such contract or cancels it without just cause. Any contractor desiring to transfer any such vessel to foreign registry upon such default or cancelation shall file an application in writing with the Secretary of Transportation setting forth its contentions with respect to the lack of just cause or lawful grounds for such default or cancelation. The Secretary of Transportation shall afford the contractor an opportunity for a hearing within twenty days after such contractor files written application therefor, and after the testimony, if any, in such hearing has been reduced to writing and filed with the Secretary of Transportation, he shall, within a reasonable time, grant or deny the application by order.

    “(b) If any such application is denied, the contractor may obtain a review of the order of denial in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within twenty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Secretary of Transportation be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Transportation or any officer designated by him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary of Transportation shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in [section 2112 of title 28][/us/usc/t28/s2112], United States Code. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether such cancelation or default was without just cause, and to affirm or set aside such order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming or setting aside any such order of the Secretary of Transportation shall be final.

    “(c) No transfer of vessels to foreign registry under this section shall become effective until any indebtedness to the Government or to any citizen of the United States, secured by such vessels, has been paid or discharged, and until after the expiration of ninety days from the date of final determination of the application or the appeal, if any. Within such ninety-day period the Secretary of Transportation may (1) with the consent of the contractor purchase the vessels at cost to the contractor plus cost of capital improvements thereon, less 4 per centum annual depreciation upon such vessel, and the actual depreciated costs of capital improvements thereon, or (2) reinstate the contract and adjust or settle the default found by the Secretary of Transportation or the court to exist.”

 __Off-Season Cruises by Passenger Vessels__ 

    “Sec. 613. (a) In this section, ‘passenger vessel’ means a vessel which (1) is of not less than ten thousand gross tons, and (2) has accommodations for not less than one hundred passengers.

    “(b) If the Secretary of Transportation finds that the operation of any passenger vessel with respect to which a contract for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy has been entered into under [section 603 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s603] effective before January 2, 1960, is not required for all of each year, in order to furnish adequate service on the service, route, or line covered by such contract, he may amend such contract to agree to pay an operating-differential subsidy for operation of the vessel (1) on such service, route, or line for some part or no part of each year, and (2) on cruises for all or part of each year if such specific cruise is approved by the Secretary of Transportation under subsection (e) of this section: Provided, however, That no such vessel may cruise for more than seven months of each year to ports which are regularly served by another United States-flag passenger vessel pursuant to an operating-differential subsidy contract.

    “(c) The Secretary of Transportation may authorize passenger vessels under operating-differential subsidy contracts to provide domestic service between specified ports while the vessels are on voyages in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States without reduction of operating-differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction-differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, if he finds that such domestic service will not result in a substantial deviation from the service, route, or line for which operating-differential subsidy is paid and will not adversely affect service on such service, route, or line.

    “(d) When a vessel is being operated on cruises or has been authorized under this section to provide domestic passenger services while on voyages in an essential service in foreign commerce of the United States—

    “(1) except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, it shall carry no mail unless required by law, or cargo except passengers’ luggage, except between those ports between which it may carry mail and cargo on its regular service assigned by contract;

    “(2) it may not carry one-way passengers between those ports served by another United States carrier on its regular service assigned by contract, without the consent of such carrier, except between those ports between which it may carry one-way passengers on its own regular service assigned by contract;

    “(3) it shall stop at other domestic ports only for the same time and the same purpose as is permitted with respect to a foreign-flag vessel which is carrying passengers who embarked at a domestic port, except that a cruise may end at a different port or coast from that where it began and may embark or disembark passengers at other domestic ports, either when not involving transportation in the domestic offshore trade in competition with a United States-flag passenger vessel offering berth service therein, or, if involving such transportation, with the consent of such carrier: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or modify section 805(a) of this Act \[now [46 U.S.C. 58101][/us/usc/t46/s58101]\].

    “(4) Any other provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\] or of the Shipping Act, 1916 \[former 46 U.S.C. App. 801 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101]\], to the contrary notwithstanding, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, it may carry cargo and mail between ports to the extent such carriage is not in direct competition with a carrier offering United States-flag berth service between those ports, or, if such carriage is in direct competition with one or more carriers offering United States-flag berth service between such ports, with the consent of the next scheduled United States-flag carrier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in the judgment of the Maritime Administrator.

    “Section 605(c) of this Act shall not apply to cruises authorized under this section. Notwithstanding the applicable provisions of sections 605(a) and 506 \[set out above\] of this Act requiring the reduction of operating differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, such reduction of operating subsidy and partial payback of construction subsidy under sections 605(a) and 506, respectively, shall not apply to cruises or domestic services authorized under this section.

    “(e) Upon the application of any operator for approval of a specific cruise, the Secretary of Transportation, after notice to all other American flag operators who may be affected and after affording all such operators an opportunity to submit written data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity to present the same orally in any manner, and after consideration of all relevant matter presented, shall approve the proposed cruise, if he determines that the proposed cruise will not substantially adversely affect an existing operator’s service performed with passenger vessels of United States registry. Such approval shall not be given more than two years in advance of the beginning of the cruise.”

 __Suspension of Operating Differential Subsidy Contracts by Operator Recipients__ 

    “Sec. 614. (a) Any operator receiving operating differential subsidy funds may elect, for all or a portion of its ships, to suspend its operating differential subsidy contract with all attendant statutory and contractual restrictions, except as to those pertaining to the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service, including any agreement providing for the replacement of vessels, if—

    “(1) the vessel is less than ten years of age;

    “(2) the suspension period is not less than twelve months;

    “(3) the operator’s financial condition is maintained at a level acceptable to the Secretary of Commerce; and

    “(4) the owner agrees to pay to the Secretary, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, an amount which bears the same proportion to the construction differential subsidy paid by the Secretary as the portion of the suspension period during which the vessel is operated in any preference trade from which a subsidized vessel would otherwise be excluded by law or contract bears to the entire economic life of the vessel.

    “(b) Any operator making an election under this section is entitled to full reinstatement of the suspended contract on request. The Secretary of Commerce may prescribe rules and regulations consistent with the purpose of this section.”

    (As added [Pub. L. 97–35, title XVI, § 1603][/us/pl/97/35/s1603], Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 751][/us/stat/95/751].)

 __Construction, Reconstruction, or Acquisition of Vessels Over Five Thousand Deadweight Tons in Foreign Shipyards; Preconditions__ 

“Sec. 615. (a) The Secretary of Commerce may, until September 30, 1983, authorize an operator receiving or applying for operating differential subsidy under this title to construct, reconstruct, or acquire its vessels of over five thousand deadweight tons in a foreign shipyard if the Secretary finds and certifies in writing that such operator’s application for construction differential subsidy cannot be approved due to the unavailability of funds in the construction differential subsidy account. Vessels constructed, reconstructed, or modified pursuant to this section shall be deemed to have been United States built for the purposes of this title, section 901(b) of this Act \[now [46 U.S.C. 55305][/us/usc/t46/s55305]\], and section 5(7) of the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978 ([46 U.S.C. 391(a)(7)][/us/usc/t46/s391/a/7] \[391a(7)\]) \[now [46 U.S.C. 3704–370][/us/usc/t46/s3704–370]9\]: Provided, That the provisions of section 607 of this Act shall not apply to vessels constructed, reconstructed, modified, or acquired pursuant to this section.

>     “(b) The provisions of this section shall be effective for fiscal year 1983 only if the President in his annual budget message for that year requests at least $100,000,000 in construction differential subsidy or proposes an alternate program that would create equivalent merchant shipbuilding activity in privately owned United States shipyards and the Secretary reports to Congress on the effect such action will have on the shipyard mobilization base at least thirty days prior to making the certification referred to in subsection (a).”

    (As added [Pub. L. 97–35, title XVI, § 1610][/us/pl/97/35/s1610], Aug. 13, 1981, [95 Stat. 753][/us/stat/95/753].)

In order to assure equitable treatment for each range of ports referred to in the preceding sentence, not less than 10 percent of the funds appropriated for construction-differential subsidy and operating-differential subsidy pursuant to this Act or any law authorizing funds for the purposes of this Act shall be allocated to each such port range: Provided, however, That such allocation shall apply to the extent that subsidy contracts are approved by the Secretary of Transportation. For the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall establish trade routes, services, or lines that take into account the seasonal closure of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and provide for alternate routing of ships via a different range of ports during that closure so as to maintain continuity of service on a year-round basis. For the purposes of section 605(c) \[set out above\], such an alternate routing via a different range of ports shall be deemed to be service from Great Lakes ports, provided such alternative routing is based upon receipt or delivery of cargo at Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway ports under through intermodal bills of lading.
