    In subsection (a), the words “apply to the United States, including” are substituted for “extend to” for clarity. The words “From and after February 1, 1922” and “not covered thereby on June 5, 1920” are omitted as obsolete. The requirement to establish adequate steamship service to the island Territories and possessions is omitted as obsolete.

    Subsection (b)(2) is based on section 503(b) of the Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States of America ([48 U.S.C. 1801][/us/usc/t48/s1801] note).

    Subsection (b)(3) is based on Proc. No. 3215, Dec. 12, 1957, 72 Stat. c19, which provided that the President, “under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 21 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \[46 App. U.S.C. 877\], do hereby declare and proclaim that the period for the establishment of an adequate shipping service for Canton Island is extended until further notice by proclamation of the President, and that the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island is deferred until it is declared by proclamation of the President that such adequate shipping service has been established”.

    In subsection (b)(4), the words “and fix a date for the going into effect of same” are omitted as surplus.

    The provisos of 46 App. U.S.C. 877 relating to the Philippine Islands are omitted as obsolete because of the independence of the Philippine Islands. See Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, [60 Stat. 1352][/us/stat/60/1352] ([22 U.S.C. 1394][/us/usc/t22/s1394] note).
