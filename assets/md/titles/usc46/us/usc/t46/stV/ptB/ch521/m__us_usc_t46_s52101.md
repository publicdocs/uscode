    In subsection (c)(1)(B), the words “(as applicable)” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (d), the words “certificate described in section 9(a) of the Military Selective Service Act (50 App. U.S.C. 459(a))” are substituted for “certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of [section 4301(a) of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s4301/a]” because [section 4301 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s4301] was amended generally by [section 2(a) of Public Law 103–353][/us/pl/103/353/s2/a], and before the amendment section 4301(a)(1) referred to a certificate described in section 9(a) of the Military Selective Service Act (50 App. U.S.C. 459(a)).
