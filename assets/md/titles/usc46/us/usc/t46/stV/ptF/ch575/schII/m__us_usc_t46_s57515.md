    (a)  __In General__  __.—__ 

    The Secretary of Transportation shall award the charter to the bidder proposing to pay the highest monthly charter hire.

    If the Secretary rejects the highest bid, the Secretary may—

        (2) reject all bids and either readvertise the line or operate the line until conditions appear more favorable to reoffer the line for private charter.

    (c)  __Reason for Rejection__  __.—__ 

    On request of a bidder, the reason for rejection shall be stated in writing to the bidder.

    In subsection (a), the words “if the Secretary considers the charter hire offered too low” are substituted for “if, in the Secretary’s discretion, the charter hire offered is deemed too low” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “lacks the qualifications required by [section 57514 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s57514]” are substituted for “lacks sufficient capital, credit, or experience to operate successfully the line” to avoid repeating the qualifications in more than one place.
