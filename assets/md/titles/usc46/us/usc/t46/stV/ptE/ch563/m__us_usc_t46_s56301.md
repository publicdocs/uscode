    The words “or other watercraft” are omitted because of the definition of “vessel” in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words “The termination of any emergency so declared shall be announced by a further proclamation by the President” are omitted as superseded by the National Emergencies Act ([50 U.S.C. 1601][/us/usc/t50/s1601] et seq.).
