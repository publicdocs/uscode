        (4) The vessel is not substantially altered without the review and approval of an individual licensed by a State as a naval architect or marine engineer before the beginning of such substantial alteration.

        (5) The vessel undergoes a condition survey at least twice in 5 years, not to exceed 3 years between surveys, to the satisfaction of a marine surveyor of an organization accepted by the Secretary.

        (6) The vessel undergoes an out-of-water survey at least once every 5 years to the satisfaction of a certified marine surveyor of an organization accepted by the Secretary.

        (7) Once every 5 years and at the time of a substantial alteration to such vessel, compliance of the vessel with the requirements of paragraph (3) is reviewed and updated as necessary.

        (8) For the life of the vessel, the owner of the vessel maintains records to demonstrate compliance with this subsection and makes such records readily available for inspection by an official authorized to enforce this chapter.

    (f)

        (1) Not later than 10 years after the date of the enactment of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report that provides an analysis of the adequacy of the requirements under subsection (e) in maintaining the safety of the fishing vessels and fish tender vessels which are described in subsection (c)(2) and which comply with the requirements of subsection (e).

        (2) If the report required under this subsection includes a determination that the safety requirements under subsection (e) are not adequate or that additional safety measures are necessary, that the Secretary may establish an alternative safety compliance program for fishing vessels or fish tender vessels (or both) which are described in subsection (c)(2) and which comply with the requirements of subsection (e).

        (3)

         The alternative safety compliance program established under this subsection shall include requirements for—

            (A) vessel construction;

            (B) a vessel stability test;

            (C) vessel stability and loading instructions;

            (D) an assigned vessel loading mark;

            (E) a vessel condition survey at least twice in 5 years, not to exceed 3 years between surveys;

            (F) an out-of-water vessel survey at least once every 5 years;

            (G) maintenance of records to demonstrate compliance with the program, and the availability of such records for inspection; and
