    Section 7503 provides that the issuance of a license, certificate, or document may be denied by the Secretary to any individual who has been convicted, within 10 years, of violating a dangerous drug law of the United States or to any individual who has been a user of a dangerous drug, unless the individual provides satisfactory proof of being cured. This includes PCP and LSD. See also the note to section 7704. However, the Secretary may deny issuing a license, certificate or document to the individual who has used or been convicted of a “controlled substance” such as LSD if that use or conviction occurred before the date of enactment of this Act.

    1985—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 99–36][/us/pl/99/36] substituted “certificate of registry, or merchant mariner’s document” for first reference to “certificate, or document”.
