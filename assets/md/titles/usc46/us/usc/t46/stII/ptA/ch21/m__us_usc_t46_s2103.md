    Section 2103 provides the Secretary with the authority to superintend the merchant marine and those involved personnel insofar as the vessels and personnel are not subject, under other laws, to the supervision of another official. The Secretary has the duty to enforce the laws with respect to vessels and seamen and to carry out correctly and uniformly these laws and regulations. The term “superintendence” is used to indicate the Secretary’s broad responsibility for overseeing maritime safety and seamen’s welfare, including employment, shipping, navigation, and protection of the marine environment.

 __Amendments__ 

    1986—[Pub. L. 99–307][/us/pl/99/307] substituted “subtitle. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of this subtitle” for “subtitle and regulations prescribed under this subtitle”.
