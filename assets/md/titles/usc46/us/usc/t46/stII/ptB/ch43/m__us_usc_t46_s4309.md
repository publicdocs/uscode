    Section 4309 requires the establishment and maintenance of certain records by manufacturers, and the inspection and access to these records by the Secretary, at reasonable times, so as to assure Federal enforcement officials that the manufacturer has acted or is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It also provides protection for matters related to trade secrets and exemptions from public disclosure.
