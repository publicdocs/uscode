    Section 3718 provides the authority to assess civil penalties for violation of the chapter or regulations. Each violation subjects the violator to a penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each violation and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day shall constitute a separate violation and the vessel is liable in rem. The procedures for assessing penalties are found in section 2107 of part A.

    With respect to criminal penalties, a willful or knowing violation of the section or a regulation subjects the offender, upon conviction, to a criminal fine of not more than $50,000 for each violation or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. If the willful and knowing violation involves the use of a dangerous weapon or constitutes an assault or battery, the offender is subjected to a fine of not more than $100,000 or imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both.

    In addition, where the owner or operator of the vessel is subject to any of the penalties prescribed, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to withhold required Customs clearance, at the request of the Secretary. Clearance may be granted upon the filing of a bond or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary.
