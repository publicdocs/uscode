## § 2305. Injunctions

    (a) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to enjoin the negligent operation of vessels prohibited by this chapter on the petition of the Attorney General for the United States Government.

    (b)

     When practicable, the Secretary shall—

        (1) give notice to any person against whom an action for injunctive relief is considered under this section an opportunity to present that person’s views; and

        (2) except for a knowing and willful violation, give the person a reasonable opportunity to achieve compliance.

    (c) The failure to give notice and opportunity to present views under subsection (b) of this section does not preclude the court from granting appropriate relief.
