## § 10316. Trusts

    Sections 10314 and 10315 of this title do not prevent an employer from making deductions from the wages of a seaman, with the written consent of the seaman, if—

    (2)

     the payments are held in trust to provide, from principal or interest, or both, any of the following benefits for those seamen and their families and dependents:

        (A) medical or hospital care, or both.

        (B) pensions on retirement or death of the seaman.

        (C) life insurance.

        (D) unemployment benefits.

        (E) compensation for illness or injuries resulting from occupational activity.

        (F) sickness, accident, and disability compensation.

    Section 10316 qualifies the two previous sections by allowing an employer to make deductions from seamen’s wages for the purpose of placing the wages into a trust fund or holding them in trust to provide for the seamen’s benefit.
