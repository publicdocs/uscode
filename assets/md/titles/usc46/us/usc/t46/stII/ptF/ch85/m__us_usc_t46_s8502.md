    (d) A State or political subdivision of a State may not levy pilot charges on a vessel lawfully piloted by a pilot required under this section.

    (e) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of a vessel operated in violation of this section or a regulation prescribed under this section is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $10,000. The vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.

    (g)

        (1) The Secretary shall designate by regulation the areas of the approaches to and waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska, if any, on which a vessel subject to this section is not required to be under the direction and control of a pilot licensed under [section 7101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s7101].

        (2) In any area of Prince William Sound, Alaska, where a vessel subject to this section is required to be under the direction and control of a pilot licensed under [section 7101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s7101], the pilot may not be a member of the crew of that vessel and shall be a pilot licensed by the State of Alaska who is operating under a Federal license, when the vessel is navigating waters between 60°49′ North latitude and the Port of Valdez, Alaska.

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a dredge to which this section would otherwise apply is exempt from the requirements of this section.

        (2) If the Secretary determines, after notice and comment, that the exemption under paragraph (1) creates a hazard to navigational safety in a specified area, the Secretary may require that a dredge exempted by paragraph (1) which is operating in that area shall comply with this section.

    Section 8502 sets forth the provisions and requirements for pilots licensed under section 7101. It is an exception provided by law envisioned under section 8501(a).

    Subsection (a) applies the requirement for a Federal pilot to coastwise seagoing vessels if propelled by machinery and inspected under part B or if inspected under chapter 37, including a tank barge. The section has been carefully worded to clearly set out those vessels that are required at times to have a Federal pilot.

    Subsection (b) prohibits Federal pilot fees from being higher than those required for State pilots. Subsections (c) and (d) prohibit States from imposing impediments to the proper performance of, or levying charges related to, Federal pilotage.

    Subsections (e) and (f) prescribe civil penalties for violation of this section.
