## § 12113. Fishery endorsement

    (a)  __Requirements__  __.—__ 

    A fishery endorsement may be issued for a vessel that—

        (5) otherwise qualifies under the laws of the United States to engage in the fisheries.

    (b)  __Authorized Activity__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        Subject to the laws of the United States regulating the fisheries, a vessel for which a fishery endorsement is issued may engage in the fisheries.

        (2)  __Use by prohibited persons__  __.—__ 

        A fishery endorsement is invalid immediately if the vessel for which it is issued is used as a fishing vessel while it is chartered or leased to an individual who is not a citizen of the United States or to an entity that is not eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement.

    (c)  __Ownership Requirements for Entities__  __.—__ 

        (1)  __In general__  __.—__ 

        A vessel owned by an entity is eligible for a fishery endorsement only if at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity, at each tier of ownership and in the aggregate, is owned and controlled by citizens of the United States.

        (2)  __Determining 75 percent interest__  __.—__ 

        In determining whether at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity is owned and controlled by citizens of the United States under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall apply [section 50501(d) of this title][/us/usc/t46/s50501/d], except that for this purpose the terms “control” or “controlled”—

                (i) direct the business of the entity;

                (ii) limit the actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the board of directors, any general partner, or any person serving in a management capacity of the entity; or

        (3)  __Exceptions__  __.—__ 

        This subsection does not apply to a vessel when it is engaged in the fisheries in the exclusive economic zone under the authority of the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council established under section 302(a)(1)(H) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act ([16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(H)][/us/usc/t16/s1852/a/1/H]) or to a purse seine vessel when it is engaged in tuna fishing in the Pacific Ocean outside the exclusive economic zone or pursuant to the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Treaty, provided that the owner of the vessel continues to comply with the eligibility requirements for a fishery endorsement under the Federal law that was in effect on October 1, 1998. A fishery endorsement issued pursuant to this paragraph is valid for engaging only in the activities described in this paragraph.

        (3)  __Transfer of ownership__  __.—__ 

        Transfers of ownership and control of vessels subject to subsection (c) or (d), which are 100 feet or greater in registered length, shall be rigorously scrutinized for violations of those provisions, with particular attention given to—

    In subsection (b)(1), the word “only” is omitted because section 12102(a), as revised by the bill, contains a general requirement for appropriate documentation to engage in any trade.

    In subsection (c)(1), the word “entity” is substituted for “corporation, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or any other entity” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (e)(3), the words “After October 1, 2001” are omitted as obsolete.

    In subsection (i), the first two sentences of [section 203(b) of Public Law 105–277][/us/pl/105/277/s203/b] are omitted as obsolete.

 __References in Text__ 

    The American Fisheries Act ([Public Law 105–277, div. C, title II][/us/pl/105/277]) ([16 U.S.C. 1851][/us/usc/t16/s1851] note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(i), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Introductory provisions and cl. (i) of subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section were derived from former [section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t46/s12102/c/5/B] in the general amendment of this chapter by [Pub. L. 109–304, § 5][/us/pl/109/304/s5], Oct. 6, 2006, [120 Stat. 1491][/us/stat/120/1491]. As part of that amendment, the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a reference to “such Act” which had been preceded by references to both of the above named Acts. See the Historical and Revision Notes above and [section 2 of Pub. L. 109–304][/us/pl/109/304/s2], set out as a Legislative Purpose and Construction note preceding [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s101].

    Section 208(e) and (g) of the American Fisheries Act, referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(ii), (C)(i), (iii), is section 208(e) and (g), respectively, of title II of div. C of [Pub. L. 105–277][/us/pl/105/277], Oct. 21, 1998, [112 Stat. 2681–625][/us/stat/112/2681-625], 2681–627, which is set out in a note under [section 1851 of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s1851], Conservation.

    Section 219(a)(7) of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005, referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B)(ii), (C)(iii), is [section 219(a)(7) of Pub. L. 108–447][/us/pl/108/447/s219/a/7], div. B, title II, Dec. 8, 2004, [118 Stat. 2887][/us/stat/118/2887], which is not classified to the Code.

    The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, referred to in subsec. (g), is [Pub. L. 94–265][/us/pl/94/265], Apr. 13, 1976, [90 Stat. 331][/us/stat/90/331], which is classified principally to chapter 38 (§ 1801 et seq.) of Title 16, Conservation. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under [section 1801 of Title 16][/us/usc/t16/s1801] and Tables.

    Subsec. (d)(2)(C), (D). [Pub. L. 111–281, § 602(a)(4)][/us/pl/111/281/s602/a/4], (5), added subpars. (C) and (D).

    2008—Subsec. (g). [Pub. L. 110–181][/us/pl/110/181] inserted “and” after “Conservation”.

[Pub. L. 100–239, § 4][/us/pl/100/239/s4], Jan. 11, 1988, [101 Stat. 1779][/us/stat/101/1779], as amended by [Pub. L. 101–225, title III, § 310][/us/pl/101/225/s310], Dec. 12, 1989, [103 Stat. 1926][/us/stat/103/1926], provided that:

>     “(a)

>      Notwithstanding the requirements of section 12108(a)(2) and (3) \[now section 12113(a)(2) and (3)\] of title 46, United States Code, a fishery license may be issued to a vessel that before July 28, 1987—

>         “(1)
