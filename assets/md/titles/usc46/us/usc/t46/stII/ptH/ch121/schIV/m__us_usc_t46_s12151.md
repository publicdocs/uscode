Each day of a continuing violation is a separate violation.

    (b) __Seizure and Forfeiture of Vessels.—__ 

    A vessel and its equipment are liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government if—

    In subsection (b), in restating 46 App. U.S.C. 883a (2d, last sentences), the penalty of $200 for the owner and master of the vessel is omitted because subsection (a) provides a general civil penalty for violation of this chapter. The authority to remit or mitigate a penalty under section 2107(b) is omitted because section 2107(b) applies to subtitle II and this section is in subtitle II.

 __Amendments__ 

    2012—Subsec. (a). [Pub. L. 112–213][/us/pl/112/213] designated existing provisions as par. (1), inserted par. (1) heading, substituted “Except as provided in paragraph (2), a person that violates” for “A person that violates” and “$15,000” for “$10,000”, and added par. (2).
