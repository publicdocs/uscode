## § 11507. Surrender of offending officers

    When an officer of a vessel of the United States (except the master) has violated [section 2191 of title 18][/us/usc/t18/s2191], and the master has actual knowledge of the offense or if complaint is made within 3 days after reaching port, the master shall surrender the offending officer to the proper authorities. If the master fails to use diligence to comply with this section and the offender escapes, the owner, the master, and the vessel are liable for damages to the individual unlawfully punished.
