## § 3709. Exemptions

    The Secretary may exempt a vessel from the minimum requirements established by sections 3704–3706 of this title for segregated ballast, crude oil washing, and dedicated clean ballast if the Secretary decides that shore-based reception facilities are a preferred method of handling ballast and that adequate facilities are readily available.

([Pub. L. 98–89][/us/pl/98/89], Aug. 26, 1983, [97 Stat. 524][/us/stat/97/524].)
