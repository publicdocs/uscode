 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Revised section 14702

    Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 83i.

    Section 14702 provides that a person knowingly making a false statement or representation in a matter in which a statement or representation is required by this part or a regulation prescribed under this part is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $20,000 for each false statement or representation. It further provides that the vessel is liable in rem for the penalty. This penalty is increased from $1,000 in existing law and conforms with the level of similar penalties throughout the subtitle.
