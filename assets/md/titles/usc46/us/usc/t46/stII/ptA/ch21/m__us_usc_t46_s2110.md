    Subsec. (b)(5). [Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(C)][/us/pl/109/304/s15/6/C], substituted “The fee” for “The fees”.

    Subsec. (f). [Pub. L. 109–304, § 15(6)(D)][/us/pl/109/304/s15/6/D], substituted “Secretary of Homeland Security shall deny the clearance required by [section 60105 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s60105]” for “Secretary of the Treasury shall deny the clearance required by section 4197 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (46 App. U.S.C. 91)”.

The Secretary may not establish a fee or charge under paragraph (1) for inspection or examination under this title for any publicly-owned ferry.” after “annually.”, was executed by making insertion in subsec.

    1991—Subsec. (b)(5). [Pub. L. 102–241][/us/pl/102/241] added par. (5).

    1990—[Pub. L. 101–508][/us/pl/101/508], as amended by [Pub. L. 104–324][/us/pl/104/324], substituted “Fees” for “Fees prohibited” as section catchline and amended text generally.
