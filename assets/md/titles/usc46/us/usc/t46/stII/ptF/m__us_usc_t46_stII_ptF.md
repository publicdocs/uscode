### Part F—Manning of Vessels

 __Historical and Revision Notes__ 

    Part F provides for the manning of vessels including requirements generally for the number of individuals required, qualifications and conditions of employment, and duties; for masters and other licenses and registered individuals; for pilots; for unlicensed personnel; for small vessels; for tank vessels; and for pilotage on the Great Lakes. The Committee intends that all manning provisions throughout this subtitle will be interpreted to be consistent with one another.
