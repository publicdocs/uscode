## § 11108. Taxes

    (a)  __Withholding__  __.—__ 

    Wages due or accruing to a master or seaman on a vessel in the foreign, coastwise, intercoastal, interstate, or noncontiguous trade or an individual employed on a fishing vessel or any fish processing vessel may not be withheld under the tax laws of a State or a political subdivision of a State. However, this section does not prohibit withholding wages of a seaman on a vessel in the coastwise trade between ports in the same State if the withholding is under a voluntary agreement between the seaman and the employer of the seaman.

    (b) __Liability.—__ 

        (1)  __Limitation on jurisdiction to tax__  __.—__ 

        An individual to whom this subsection applies is not subject to the income tax laws of a State or political subdivision of a State, other than the State and political subdivision in which the individual resides, with respect to compensation for the performance of duties described in paragraph (2).

        (2)  __Application__  __.—__ 

        This subsection applies to an individual—

            (A) engaged on a vessel to perform assigned duties in more than one State as a pilot licensed under [section 7101 of this title][/us/usc/t46/s7101] or licensed or authorized under the laws of a State; or

            (B) who performs regularly assigned duties while engaged as a master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on navigable waters in 2 or more States.
