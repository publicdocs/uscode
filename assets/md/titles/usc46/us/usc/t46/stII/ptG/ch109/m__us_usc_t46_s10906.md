## § 10906. Discharge of crew for unsuitability

    When a survey is made at a foreign port, the surveyors shall state in the report whether, in their opinion, the vessel had been sent to sea unsuitably provided in any important particular, by neglect or design or through mistake or accident. If by neglect or design, and the consular officer approves the finding, the officer shall discharge a seaman requesting discharge and shall require the master to pay one month’s wages to that seaman in addition to wages then due, or sufficient money for the return of the seaman to the nearest and most convenient port of the United States, whichever is the greater amount.

([Pub. L. 98–89][/us/pl/98/89], Aug. 26, 1983, [97 Stat. 576][/us/stat/97/576].)
