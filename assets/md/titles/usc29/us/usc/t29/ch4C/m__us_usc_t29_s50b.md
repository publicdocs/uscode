## § 50b. Appointment of employees

    The Secretary of Labor is authorized to appoint such employees as he may from time to time find necessary for the administration of this chapter, with regard to existing laws applicable to the appointment and compensation of employees of the United States.

([Aug. 16, 1937, ch. 663, § 3][/us/act/1937-08-16/ch663/s3], [50 Stat. 665][/us/stat/50/665]; [July 12, 1943, ch. 221][/us/act/1943-07-12/ch221], title VII, [57 Stat. 518][/us/stat/57/518].)

 __Codification__ 

    Proviso authorizing employment of certain persons in the division of apprentice training of National Youth Administration, was omitted in view of abolition of that agency by act July 12, 1943.

    Provision formerly in this section relieved National Youth Administration, after August 16, 1937, of responsibility for promotion of labor standards of apprenticeship, and directed transfer of records and papers to Department of Labor.
