## § 794g. Limitations on use of subminimum wage

    (a) __In general__ 

    No entity, including a contractor or subcontractor of the entity, which holds a special wage certificate as described in section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ([29 U.S.C. 214(c)][/us/usc/t29/s214/c]) may compensate an individual with a disability who is age 24 or younger at a wage (referred to in this section as a “subminimum wage”) that is less than the Federal minimum wage unless 1 of the following conditions is met:

        (1) The individual is currently employed, as of the effective date of this section, by an entity that holds a valid certificate pursuant to section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

        (2)

         The individual, before beginning work that is compensated at a subminimum wage, has completed, and produces documentation indicating completion of, each of the following actions:

            (A) The individual has received pre-employment transition services that are available to the individual under [section 733 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s733], or transition services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ([20 U.S.C. 1400][/us/usc/t20/s1400] et seq.) such as transition services available to the individual under section 614(d) of that Act ([20 U.S.C. 1414(d)][/us/usc/t20/s1414/d]).

            (B)

             The individual has applied for vocational rehabilitation services under subchapter I, with the result that—

                (i)

                    (I) the individual has been found ineligible for such services pursuant to that subchapter and has documentation consistent with [section 722(a)(5)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s722/a/5/C] regarding the determination of ineligibility; or

                    (II)

                        (aa) the individual has been determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services;

                        (bb) the individual has an individualized plan for employment under [section 722 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s722];

                        (cc) the individual has been working toward an employment outcome specified in such individualized plan for employment, with appropriate supports and services, including supported employment services, for a reasonable period of time without success; and

                        (dd) the individual’s vocational rehabilitation case is closed; and

                (ii)

                    (I) the individual has been provided career counseling, and information and referrals to Federal and State programs and other resources in the individual’s geographic area that offer employment-related services and supports designed to enable the individual to explore, discover, experience, and attain competitive integrated employment; and

                    (II) such counseling and information and referrals are not for employment compensated at a subminimum wage provided by an entity described in this subsection, and such employment-related services are not compensated at a subminimum wage and do not directly result in employment compensated at a subminimum wage provided by an entity described in this subsection.

    (b) __Construction__ 

        (1) __Rule__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to—

            (A) change the purpose of this chapter described in [section 701(b)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s701/b/2], to empower individuals with disabilities to maximize opportunities for competitive integrated employment; or

            (B) is informed by the employer of self-advocacy, self-determination, and peer mentoring training opportunities available in the individual’s geographic area, provided by an entity that does not have any financial interest in the individual’s employment outcome, under applicable Federal and State programs or other sources.
