## § 794f. Establishment of standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment

    (a) __Standards__ 

        Not later than 24 months after March 23, 2010, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board shall, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, promulgate regulatory standards in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act ([2 U.S.C. 551][/us/usc/t2/s551] et seq.)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  setting forth the minimum technical criteria for medical diagnostic equipment used in (or in conjunction with) physician’s offices, clinics, emergency rooms, hospitals, and other medical settings. The standards shall ensure that such equipment is accessible to, and usable by, individuals with accessibility needs, and shall allow independent entry to, use of, and exit from the equipment by such individuals to the maximum extent possible.

    (b) __Medical diagnostic equipment covered__ 

        The standards issued under subsection (a) for medical diagnostic equipment shall apply to equipment that includes examination tables, examination chairs (including chairs used for eye examinations or procedures, and dental examinations or procedures), weight scales, mammography equipment, x-ray machines, and other radiological equipment commonly used for diagnostic purposes by health professionals.

    (c) __Review and amendment__ 

        The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, shall periodically review and, as appropriate, amend the standards in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act ([2 U.S.C. 551][/us/usc/t2/s551] et seq.).1

([Pub. L. 93–112, title V, § 510][/us/pl/93/112/s510], as added [Pub. L. 111–148, title IV, § 4203][/us/pl/111/148/s4203], Mar. 23, 2010, [124 Stat. 570][/us/stat/124/570].)

 __References in Text__ 

    March 23, 2010, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “the date of enactment of the Affordable Health Choices Act”, which was translated as meaning the date of enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, [Pub. L. 111–148][/us/pl/111/148], which enacted this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

    The Administrative Procedure Act, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (c), is [act June 11, 1946, ch. 324][/us/act/1946-06-11/ch324], [60 Stat. 237][/us/stat/60/237], which was repealed and reenacted as subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, by [Pub. L. 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], Sept. 6, 1966, [80 Stat. 378][/us/stat/80/378].
