                    (II) individuals with disabilities and representatives of individuals with disabilities; and

                    (III) a representative of the appropriate designated State unit;

                (iii) identify the skills necessary to perform the jobs and careers identified; and

    (f) __Indicators for compliance with evaluation standards; annual reports; onsite compliance reviews; analysis included in reports to Congress__

                    (II) participation in the review would give the appearance of a conflict of interest.

        (4) In making a determination concerning any subsequent grant under this section, the Commissioner shall consider the past performance of the applicant, if applicable. The Commissioner shall use compliance indicators developed under this subsection that are consistent with program evaluation standards developed under subsection (d) of this section to assess minimum project performance for purposes of making continuation awards in the third, fourth, and fifth years.

        (5) Each fiscal year the Commissioner shall include in the annual report to Congress required by [section 710 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s710] an analysis of the extent to which grant recipients have complied with the evaluation standards.
