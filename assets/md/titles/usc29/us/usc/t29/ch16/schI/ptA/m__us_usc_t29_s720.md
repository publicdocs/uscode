## § 720. Declaration of policy; authorization of appropriations

    (a) __Findings; purpose; policy__ 

        (1) __Findings__ 

        Congress finds that—

            (A)

             work—

                (i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and

                (ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;

            (B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;

            (C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in competitive integrated employment settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;

            (D)

             reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include—

                (i) discrimination;

                (ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;

                (iii) fear of losing health coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 1395][/us/usc/t42/s1395] et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing private health insurance; and

                (iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;

            (E) enforcement of subchapter V and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ([42 U.S.C. 12101][/us/usc/t42/s12101] et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;

            (F) the provision of workforce development activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and

            (G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce development systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce development activities.

        (2) __Purpose__ 

        The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is—

            (A) an integral part of a statewide workforce development system; and

            (B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.

        (3) __Policy__ 

        It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:

            (A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.

            (B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain competitive integrated employment.

            (C)

             Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices—

                (i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and

                (ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.

            (D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.

            (E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as described in [section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s721/a/7/B] (referred to individually in this subchapter as a “qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor”), other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel should facilitate the accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an individual.

            (F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals’ representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.

            (G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.

    (b) __Authorization of appropriations__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For the purpose of making grants to States under part B to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under [section 721 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s721], there are authorized to be appropriated $3,302,053,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2020, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this paragraph for the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year.

        (2) __Reference__ 

            The reference in paragraph (1) to grants to States under part B shall not be considered to refer to grants under [section 732 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s732].

        (2) __Application__ 

            (A) __Increase__ 

                If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.

            (B) __No increase or decrease__ 

                If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).

        (3) __Definition__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “Consumer Price Index” means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    (d) __Extension__

                has passed legislation which would have the effect of extending the authorization or duration (as the case may be) of such program, such authorization or duration is automatically extended for 1 additional year for the program authorized by this subchapter.

            (B) __Calculation__ 

                The amount authorized to be appropriated for the additional fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to the amount appropriated for such program for fiscal year 2003, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year, if the percentage change indicates an increase.

        (2) __Construction__ 

            (A) __Passage of legislation__ 

                For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), Congress shall not be deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.

            (B) __Acts or determinations of Commissioner__ 

                In any case where the Commissioner is required under an applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or determinations are required during the terminal year of such program, such acts and determinations shall be required during any fiscal year in which the extension described in that part of paragraph (1) that follows clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is in effect.
