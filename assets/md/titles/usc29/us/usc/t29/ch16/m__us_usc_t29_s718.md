## § 718. Traditionally underserved populations

    (a) __Findings__ 

    With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:

        (1) __Racial profile__ 

            The demographic profile of America is rapidly changing. While the percentage increase from 2000 to 2010 for white Americans was 9.7 percent, the percentage increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 43.0 percent for Latinos, 12.3 percent for African-Americans, and 43.2 percent for Asian-Americans.

        (2) __Rate of disability__ 

        Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. In 2011—

            (A) among Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;

            (B) among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and

            (C) for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same age range, the disability rate was also more than twice as high, at 27.0 percent.

        (3) __Inequitable treatment__ 

            Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.

        (4) __Recruitment__ 

            Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.

    (b) __Outreach to minorities__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            For each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as the “Director”) shall reserve 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this subsection. The Commissioner and the Director shall use the reserved funds to carry out one or more of the activities described in paragraph (2) through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.

        (2) __Activities__ 

        The activities carried out by the Commissioner and the Director shall include one or more of the following:

            (A) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to carry out activities under the programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII.

            (B) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to conduct research, training, technical assistance, or a related activity, to improve services provided under this chapter, especially services provided to individuals from minority backgrounds.

            (C) Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance their capacity to carry out such activities.

        (3) __Eligibility__ 

            To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (2)(C), an entity shall be a State or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization, such as an institution of higher education or an Indian tribe.

        (4) __Report__ 

            In each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that describes the activities funded under this subsection for the preceding fiscal year.

        (5) __Definitions__ 

        In this subsection:

            (A) __Historically Black college or university__ 

                The term “historically Black college or university” means a part B institution, as defined in [section 1061(2) of title 20][/us/usc/t20/s1061/2].

            (B) __Minority entity__ 

                The term “minority entity” means an entity that is a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal college or university, or another institution of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent.

    (c) __Demonstration__ 

        In awarding grants, or entering into contracts or cooperative agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter, and [section 794e of this title][/us/usc/t29/s794e], the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, in appropriate cases, shall require applicants to demonstrate how the applicants will address, in whole or in part, the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds.
