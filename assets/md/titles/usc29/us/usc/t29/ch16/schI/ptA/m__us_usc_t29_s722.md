## § 722. Eligibility and individualized plan for employment

    (a) __Eligibility__ 

        (1) __Criterion for eligibility__ 

        An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual—

            (A) is an individual with a disability under [section 705(20)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/20/A]; and

            (B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment.

        (2) __Presumption of benefit__ 

            (A) __Demonstration__ 

                For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under [section 705(20)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/20/A], unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.

            (B) __Methods__ 

                In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A), the designated State unit shall explore the individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as described in [section 705(2)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/2/D], with appropriate supports provided through the designated State unit, except under limited circumstances when an individual cannot take advantage of such experiences. Such experiences shall be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine the eligibility of the individual or to determine the existence of clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.

        (3) __Presumption of eligibility__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            For purposes of this section, an individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 401][/us/usc/t42/s401] et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be—

                (i) considered to be an individual with a significant disability under [section 705(21)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/21/A]; and

                (ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter (provided that the individual intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual) unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual in accordance with paragraph (2).

            (B) __Construction__ 

                Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.

        (4) __Use of existing information__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter and developing the individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b) of this section for the individual, the designated State unit shall use information that is existing and current (as of the date of the determination of eligibility or of the development of the individualized plan for employment), including information available from other programs and providers, particularly information used by education officials and the Social Security Administration, information provided by the individual and the family of the individual, and information obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs.

            (B) __Determinations by officials of other agencies__ 

                Determinations made by officials of other agencies, particularly education officials described in [section 721(a)(11)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s721/a/11/D], regarding whether an individual satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual is an individual with a disability under [section 705(20)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/20/A] or an individual with a significant disability under [section 705(21)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/21/A] shall be used, to the extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, in assisting the designated State unit in making such determinations.

            (C) __Basis__ 

            The determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based on—

                (i) the review of existing data described in [section 705(2)(A)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/2/A/i]; and

                (ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of assessment activities described in [section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/2/A/ii].

        (5) __Determination of ineligibility__ 

        If an individual who applies for services under this subchapter is determined, based on the review of existing data and, to the extent necessary, the assessment activities described in [section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s705/2/A/ii], not to be eligible for the services, or if an eligible individual receiving services under an individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer eligible for the services—

            (A) the ineligibility determination involved shall be made only after providing an opportunity for full consultation with the individual or, as appropriate, the individual’s representative;

            (B)

             the individual or, as appropriate, the individual’s representative, shall be informed in writing (supplemented as necessary by other appropriate modes of communication consistent with the informed choice of the individual) of the ineligibility determination, including—

                (ii) a description of the means by which the individual may express, and seek a remedy for, any dissatisfaction with the determination, including the procedures for review by an impartial hearing officer under subsection (c) of this section;

            (C) the individual shall be provided with a description of services available from the client assistance program under [section 732 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s732] and information on how to contact that program; and

            (D)

             any ineligibility determination that is based on a finding that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome shall be reviewed—

                (i) within 12 months; and

                (ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual’s representative.

        (6) __Timeframe for making an eligibility determination__ 

        The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, after the individual has submitted an application for the services unless—

            (A) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the designated State unit preclude making an eligibility determination within 60 days and the designated State unit and the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or

            (B) the designated State unit is exploring an individual’s abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations under paragraph (2)(B).

    (b) __Development of an individualized plan for employment__
