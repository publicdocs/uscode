## § 3342. Buy-American requirements

    (a) __Compliance with Buy American Act__ 

        None of the funds made available under subchapter I or II or under the Wagner-Peyser Act ([29 U.S.C. 49][/us/usc/t29/s49] et seq.) may be expended by an entity unless the entity agrees that in expending the funds the entity will comply with sections 8301 through 8303 of title 41 (commonly known as the “Buy American Act”).

    (b) __Sense of Congress; requirement regarding notice__ 

        (1) __Purchase of American-made equipment and products__

        (2) __Notice to recipients of assistance__ 

            In providing financial assistance using funds made available under subchapter I or II or under the Wagner-Peyser Act, the head of each Federal agency shall provide to each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the statement made in paragraph (1) by Congress.

    (c) __Prohibition of contracts with persons falsely labeling products as Made in America__ 

        If it has been finally determined by a court or Federal agency that any person intentionally affixed a label bearing a “Made in America” inscription, or any inscription with the same meaning, to any product sold in or shipped to the United States that is not made in the United States, the person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract made with funds made available under subchapter I or II or under the Wagner-Peyser Act ([29 U.S.C. 49][/us/usc/t29/s49] et seq.), pursuant to the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility procedures described in sections 9.400 through 9.409 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, as such sections were in effect on August 7, 1998, or pursuant to any successor regulations.
