            (B) entered into a written subgrant agreement or contract with such a subgrantee or contractor that established clear goals and obligations in unambiguous terms;

            (C) acted with due diligence to monitor the implementation of the subgrant agreement or contract, including carrying out the appropriate monitoring activities (including audits) at reasonable intervals; and

            (D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of this subchapter, including regulations issued under this subchapter, by such subgrantee or contractor.

        (3) __Waiver__

    (e) __Immediate termination or suspension of assistance in emergency situations__

    (f) __Discrimination against participants__ 

        If the Secretary determines that any recipient under this subchapter has discharged or in any other manner discriminated against a participant or against any individual in connection with the administration of the program involved, or against any individual because such individual has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this subchapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or an investigation under or related to this subchapter, or otherwise unlawfully denied to any individual a benefit to which that individual is entitled under the provisions of this subchapter, including regulations issued under this subchapter, the Secretary shall, within 30 days, take such action or order such corrective measures, as necessary, with respect to the recipient or the aggrieved individual, or both.
