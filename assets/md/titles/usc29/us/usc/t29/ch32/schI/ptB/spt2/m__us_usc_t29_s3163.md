                 incorporates additional factors (other than the factors described in paragraph (2)(A)) relating to—

                    (I) excess youth poverty in urban, rural, and suburban local areas; and

                    (II) excess unemployment above the State average in urban, rural, and suburban local areas; and

                (ii) was developed by the State board and approved by the Secretary as part of the State plan.

        (4) __Local administrative cost limit__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Of the amount allocated to a local area under this subsection and [section 3173(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3173/b] for a fiscal year, not more than 10 percent of the amount may be used by the local board involved for the administrative costs of carrying out local workforce investment activities under this subpart or subpart 3.

            (B) __Use of funds__ 

                Funds made available for administrative costs under subparagraph (A) may be used for the administrative costs of any of the local workforce investment activities described in this subpart or subpart 3, regardless of whether the funds were allocated under this subsection or [section 3173(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3173/b].

    (c) __Reallocation among local areas__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Governor may, in accordance with this subsection and after consultation with the State board, reallocate to eligible local areas within the State amounts that are made available to local areas from allocations made under this section or a corresponding provision of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for youth workforce investment activities (referred to individually in this subsection as a “local allocation”) and that are available for reallocation.

        (2) __Amount__ 

            The amount available for reallocation for a program year is equal to the amount by which the unobligated balance of the local allocation, at the end of the program year prior to the program year for which the determination under this paragraph is made, exceeds 20 percent of such allocation for the prior program year.

        (3) __Reallocation__ 

            In making reallocations to eligible local areas of amounts available pursuant to paragraph (2) for a program year, the Governor shall allocate to each eligible local area within the State an amount based on the relative amount of the local allocation for the program year for which the determination is made, as compared to the total amount of the local allocations for all eligible local areas in the State for such program year.

        (4) __Eligibility__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, an eligible local area means a local area that does not have an amount available for reallocation under paragraph (2) for the program year for which the determination under paragraph (2) is made.
