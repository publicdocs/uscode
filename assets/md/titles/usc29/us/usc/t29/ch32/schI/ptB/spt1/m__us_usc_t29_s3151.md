            (B) __Guidance for infrastructure funding__ 

            In addition to carrying out the requirements relating to the State infrastructure funding mechanism described in paragraph (2), the Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, local boards, and the State board, and consistent with the guidance and policies provided by the State board under subparagraphs (B) and (C)(i) of [section 3111(d)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3111/d/7], shall provide, for the use of local areas under subparagraph (A)(i)(I)—

            (B) __Partner contributions__ 

                Subject to subparagraph (D), for local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the covered portions of funding for a fiscal year shall be provided to the Governor from the programs described in subsection (b)(1), to assist in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in those local areas of the State not adequately funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).

The Governor shall exclude from such determination of funds the amounts for proportionate use of one-stop centers attributable to the programs of one-stop partners for those local areas of the State where the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers are funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The Governor shall also take into account the statutory requirements for each partner program and the partner program’s ability to fulfill such requirements.

                (ii) __Special rule__

Such a determination may be appealed under the process on the basis that such determination is inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph. Such process shall ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of [section 3242(e) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3242/e].

        (3) __Allocation by Governor__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                From the funds provided under paragraph (1), the Governor shall allocate the funds to local areas described in subparagraph (B) in accordance with the formula established under subparagraph (B) for the purposes of assisting in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers.

            (B) __Allocation formula__ 

                The State board shall develop a formula to be used by the Governor to allocate the funds provided under paragraph (1) to local areas not funding costs of infrastructure under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The formula shall be based on factors including the number of one-stop centers in a local area, the population served by such centers, the services provided by such centers, and other factors relating to the performance of such centers that the State board determines are appropriate.

        (4) __Costs of infrastructure__ 

            In this subsection, the term “costs of infrastructure”, used with respect to a one-stop center, means the nonpersonnel costs that are necessary for the general operation of the one-stop center, including the rental costs of the facilities, the costs of utilities and maintenance, equipment (including assessment-related products and assistive technology for individuals with disabilities), and technology to facilitate access to the one-stop center, including the center’s planning and outreach activities.

    (i) __Other funds__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            Subject to the memorandum of understanding described in subsection (c) for the one-stop delivery system involved, in addition to the funds provided to carry out subsection (h), a portion of funds made available under Federal law authorizing the programs described in subsection (b) and administered by one-stop partners, or the noncash resources available under such programs, shall be used to pay the additional costs relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system that are not paid from the funds provided under subsection (h), as determined in accordance with paragraph (3), to the extent not inconsistent with the Federal law involved. Such costs shall include the costs of the provision of career services described in [section 3174(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3174/c/2] applicable to each program and may include common costs that are not paid from the funds provided under subsection (h).

        (2) __Shared services__ 

            The costs described under paragraph (1) may include costs of services that are authorized for and may be commonly provided through the one-stop partner programs to any individual, such as initial intake, assessment of needs, appraisal of basic skills, identification of appropriate services to meet such needs, referrals to other one-stop partners, and other similar services.

        (3) __Determination and guidance__ 

            The method for determining the appropriate portion of funds and noncash resources to be provided by the one-stop partner for each program under paragraph (1) for a one-stop center shall be determined as part of the development of the memorandum of understanding under subsection (c) for the one-stop center and shall be stated in the memorandum. The State board shall provide guidance to facilitate the determination, for purposes of the memorandum of understanding, of an appropriate allocation of the funds and noncash resources in local areas, consistent with the requirements of [section 3111(d)(6)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3111/d/6/C].
