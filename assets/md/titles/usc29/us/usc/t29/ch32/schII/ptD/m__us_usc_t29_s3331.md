## § 3331. Administrative provisions

    (a) __Supplement not supplant__ 

        Funds made available for adult education and literacy activities under this subchapter shall supplement and not supplant other State or local public funds expended for adult education and literacy activities.

    (b) __Maintenance of effort__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            (A) __Determination__ 

                An eligible agency may receive funds under this subchapter for any fiscal year if the Secretary finds that the fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of such eligible agency for activities under this subchapter, in the second preceding fiscal year, were not less than 90 percent of the fiscal effort per student or the aggregate expenditures of such eligible agency for adult education and literacy activities in the third preceding fiscal year.

            (B) __Proportionate reduction__ 

            Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), for any fiscal year with respect to which the Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) that the fiscal effort or the aggregate expenditures of an eligible agency for the preceding program year were less than such effort or expenditures for the second preceding program year, the Secretary—

                (i) shall determine the percentage decreases in such effort or in such expenditures; and

                (ii) shall decrease the payment made under this subchapter for such program year to the agency for adult education and literacy activities by the lesser of such percentages.

        (2) __Computation__ 

            In computing the fiscal effort and aggregate expenditures under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall exclude capital expenditures and special one-time project costs.

        (3) __Decrease in Federal support__ 

            If the amount made available for adult education and literacy activities under this subchapter for a fiscal year is less than the amount made available for adult education and literacy activities under this subchapter for the preceding fiscal year, then the fiscal effort per student and the aggregate expenditures of an eligible agency required in order to avoid a reduction under paragraph (1)(B) shall be decreased by the same percentage as the percentage decrease in the amount so made available.

        (4) __Waiver__ 

            The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for not more than 1 fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or an unforeseen and precipitous decline in the financial resources of the State or outlying area of the eligible agency. If the Secretary grants a waiver under the preceding sentence for a fiscal year, the level of effort required under paragraph (1) shall not be reduced in the subsequent fiscal year because of the waiver.
