## § 3321. Grants and contracts for eligible providers

    (a) __Grants and contracts__ 

        From grant funds made available under [section 3302(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3302/a/1], each eligible agency shall award multiyear grants or contracts, on a competitive basis, to eligible providers within the State or outlying area to enable the eligible providers to develop, implement, and improve adult education and literacy activities within the State.

    (b) __Required local activities__ 

        The eligible agency shall require that each eligible provider receiving a grant or contract under subsection (a) use the grant or contract to establish or operate programs that provide adult education and literacy activities, including programs that provide such activities concurrently.

    (c) __Direct and equitable access; same process__ 

    Each eligible agency receiving funds under this subchapter shall ensure that—

        (1) all eligible providers have direct and equitable access to apply and compete for grants or contracts under this section; and

        (2) the same grant or contract announcement process and application process is used for all eligible providers in the State or outlying area.

    (d) __Special rule__ 

        Each eligible agency awarding a grant or contract under this section shall not use any funds made available under this subchapter for adult education and literacy activities for the purpose of supporting or providing programs, services, or activities for individuals who are not individuals described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of [section 3272(4) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3272/4], except that such agency may use such funds for such purpose if such programs, services, or activities are related to family literacy activities. In providing family literacy activities under this subchapter, an eligible provider shall attempt to coordinate with programs and services that are not assisted under this subchapter prior to using funds for adult education and literacy activities under this subchapter for activities other than activities for eligible individuals.

    (e) __Considerations__ 

    In awarding grants or contracts under this section, the eligible agency shall consider—

        (1)

         the degree to which the eligible provider would be responsive to—

            (A) regional needs as identified in the local plan under [section 3123 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3123]; and

            (B)

             serving individuals in the community who were identified in such plan as most in need of adult education and literacy activities, including individuals—

                (i) who have low levels of literacy skills; or

                (ii) who are English language learners;

        (2) the ability of the eligible provider to serve eligible individuals with disabilities, including eligible individuals with learning disabilities;

        (3) past effectiveness of the eligible provider in improving the literacy of eligible individuals, to meet State-adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance described in [section 3141 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3141], especially with respect to eligible individuals who have low levels of literacy;

        (4) the extent to which the eligible provider demonstrates alignment between proposed activities and services and the strategy and goals of the local plan under [section 3123 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3123], as well as the activities and services of the one-stop partners;

        (5)

         whether the eligible provider’s program—

            (A) is of sufficient intensity and quality, and based on the most rigorous research available so that participants achieve substantial learning gains; and

        (6) whether the eligible provider’s activities, including whether reading, writing, speaking, mathematics, and English language acquisition instruction delivered by the eligible provider, are based on the best practices derived from the most rigorous research available and appropriate, including scientifically valid research and effective educational practice;

        (7) whether the eligible provider’s activities effectively use technology, services, and delivery systems, including distance education in a manner sufficient to increase the amount and quality of learning and how such technology, services, and systems lead to improved performance;

        (8) whether the eligible provider’s activities provide learning in context, including through integrated education and training, so that an individual acquires the skills needed to transition to and complete postsecondary education and training programs, obtain and advance in employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, and to exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship;

        (9) whether the eligible provider’s activities are delivered by well-trained instructors, counselors, and administrators who meet any minimum qualifications established by the State, where applicable, and who have access to high quality professional development, including through electronic means;

        (10) whether the eligible provider’s activities coordinate with other available education, training, and social service resources in the community, such as by establishing strong links with elementary schools and secondary schools, postsecondary educational institutions, institutions of higher education, local workforce investment boards, one-stop centers, job training programs, and social service agencies, business, industry, labor organizations, community-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and intermediaries, for the development of career pathways;

        (11) whether the eligible provider’s activities offer flexible schedules and coordination with Federal, State, and local support services (such as child care, transportation, mental health services, and career planning) that are necessary to enable individuals, including individuals with disabilities or other special needs, to attend and complete programs;

        (12) whether the eligible provider maintains a high-quality information management system that has the capacity to report measurable participant outcomes (consistent with [section 3141 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3141]) and to monitor program performance; and

        (13) whether the local areas in which the eligible provider is located have a demonstrated need for additional English language acquisition programs and civics education programs.
