    (b) __Special rule for veterans__

        (1) meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (3) of such subsection; and

        (2) does not meet the requirement of subsection (a)(2) because the military income earned by such individual within the 6-month period prior to the individual’s application for Job Corps prevents the individual from meeting such requirement.
