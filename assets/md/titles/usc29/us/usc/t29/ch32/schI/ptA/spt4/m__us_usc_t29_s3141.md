                (viii) __Statistical adjustment model__ 

                    The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, after consultation with the representatives described in paragraph (4)(B), shall develop and disseminate an objective statistical model that will be used to make the adjustments in the State adjusted levels of performance for actual economic conditions and characteristics of participants under clauses (v) and (vii).
