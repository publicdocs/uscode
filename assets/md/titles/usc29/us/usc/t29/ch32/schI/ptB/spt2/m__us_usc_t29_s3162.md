                (ii) __Formula__ 

                Subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), of the remainder—

                        In any fiscal year in which the remainder described in clause (i) does not exceed $1,000,000,000, the minimum allotments under subclauses (I) and (II) shall be calculated by the methodology specified in section 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(IV) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 \[[29 U.S.C. 2852(b)(1)(C)(iv)(IV)][/us/usc/t29/s2852/b/1/C/iv/IV]\] (as in effect on the day before July 22, 2014).

                (ii) 70 percent of the lower living standard income level.

            (D) __Excess number__ 

            The term “excess number” means, used with respect to the excess number of unemployed individuals within a State, the higher of—

                (ii) the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in areas of substantial unemployment in such State.

            (E) __Low-income level__ 

                The term “low-income level” means $7,000 with respect to income in 1969, and for any later year means that amount that bears the same relationship to $7,000 as the Consumer Price Index for that year bears to the Consumer Price Index for 1969, rounded to the nearest $1,000.

        (3) __Special rule__ 

            For the purpose of the formula specified in paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall, as appropriate and to the extent practicable, exclude college students and members of the Armed Forces from the determination of the number of disadvantaged youth.

    (c) __Reallotment__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

            The Secretary shall, in accordance with this subsection, reallot to eligible States amounts that are made available to States from allotments made under this section or a corresponding provision of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for youth workforce investment activities and statewide workforce investment activities (referred to individually in this subsection as a “State allotment”) and that are available for reallotment.

        (2) __Amount__ 

            The amount available for reallotment for a program year is equal to the amount by which the unobligated balance of the State allotment, at the end of the program year prior to the program year for which the determination under this paragraph is made, exceeds 20 percent of such allotment for the prior program year.

        (3) __Reallotment__ 

            In making reallotments to eligible States of amounts available pursuant to paragraph (2) for a program year, the Secretary shall allot to each eligible State an amount based on the relative amount of the State allotment for the program year for which the determination is made, as compared to the total amount of the State allotments for all eligible States for such program year.

        (4) __Eligibility__ 

            For purposes of this subsection, an eligible State means a State that does not have an amount available for reallotment under paragraph (2) for the program year for which the determination under paragraph (2) is made.

        (5) __Procedures__ 

            The Governor shall prescribe uniform procedures for the obligation of funds by local areas within the State in order to avoid the requirement that funds be made available for reallotment under this subsection. The Governor shall further prescribe equitable procedures for making funds available from the State and local areas in the event that a State is required to make funds available for reallotment under this subsection.
