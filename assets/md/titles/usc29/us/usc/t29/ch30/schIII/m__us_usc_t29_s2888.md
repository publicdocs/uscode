    (b) __Education and vocational training__ 

        The Secretary may arrange for education and vocational training of enrollees through local public or private educational agencies, vocational educational institutions, or technical institutes, whenever such entities provide education and training substantially equivalent in cost and quality to that which the Secretary could provide through other means.

    (c) __Advanced career training programs__ 

        (1) __In general__

            (B) __Calculation__ 

                The total amount for which an enrollee shall be eligible under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by the amount of any scholarship or other educational grant assistance received by such enrollee for advanced career training.

        (3) __Demonstration__
