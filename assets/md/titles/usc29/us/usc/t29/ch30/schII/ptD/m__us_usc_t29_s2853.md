            (C) __Regulations__ 

                The Secretary, after consulting with the Governors, shall develop and issue regulations that define the term “administrative cost” for purposes of this chapter. Such definition shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

        (2) __Amount__ 

            The amount available for reallocation for a program year is equal to the amount by which the unobligated balance of the local area allocation under paragraph (2)(A) or (3) of subsection (b) of this section for such activities, at the end of the program year prior to the program year for which the determination under this paragraph is made exceeds 20 percent of such allocation for the prior program year.

For purposes of this paragraph, local areas that received allocations under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section for the prior program year shall be treated as if the local areas received allocations under subsection (b)(3) of this section for such year.

        (4) __Eligibility__
