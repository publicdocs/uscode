        (2) __General authorities__ 

            In providing such assistance, protection and advocacy systems shall have the same general authorities as the systems are afforded under subtitle C of title I of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 ([42 U.S.C. 15041][/us/usc/t42/s15041] et seq.), as determined by the Secretary.

            From the funds appropriated under [section 3007(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3007/b] for a fiscal year and remaining after the reservation required by paragraph (1) has been made, the Secretary shall make a grant to a protection and advocacy system within each State in an amount bearing the same ratio to the remaining funds as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.

        (3) __Minimums__ 

        Subject to the availability of appropriations, the amount of a grant to a protection and advocacy system under paragraph (2) for a fiscal year shall—

            (A) in the case of a protection and advocacy system located in American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, not be less than $30,000; and

        (1) __Grant to lead agency__ 

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, with respect to a State that, on November 12, 1998, was described in section 2212(f)(1)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, the Secretary shall pay the amount of the grant described in subsection (a), and made under subsection (b), to the lead agency designated under [section 3003(c)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s3003/c/1] for the State.

            A lead agency to which a grant amount is paid under paragraph (1) shall determine the manner in which funds made available through the grant will be allocated among the entities that were providing protection and advocacy services in that State on the date described in such paragraph, and shall distribute funds to such entities. In distributing such funds, the lead agency shall not establish any additional eligibility or procedural requirements for an entity in the State that supports protection and advocacy services through a protection and advocacy system. Such an entity shall comply with the same requirements (including reporting and enforcement requirements) as any other entity that receives funding under this section.

        (3) __Application of provisions__ 

            Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions of this section shall apply to the grant in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to a grant to a system.
