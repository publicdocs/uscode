    (c) __Satisfaction__ 

        Any such compromise or waiver, in the absence of fraud or duress, shall, according to the terms thereof, be a complete satisfaction of such cause of action and a complete bar to any action based on such cause of action.

    (d) __Retroactive effect of section__ 

        The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to any compromise or waiver heretofore so made or given.

    (e) __“Compromise” defined__
