## § 1322a. Multiemployer plan benefits guaranteed

    (a) __Benefits of covered plans subject to guarantee__ 

    The corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a multiemployer plan—

        (1) to which this subchapter applies, and

        (2) which is insolvent under section 1426(b) or 1441(d)(2) of this title.

    (b) __Benefits or benefit increases not eligible for guarantee__ 

        (1)

            (A) For purposes of this section, a benefit or benefit increase which has been in effect under a plan for less than 60 months is not eligible for the corporation’s guarantee. For purposes of this paragraph, any month of any plan year during which the plan was insolvent or terminated (within the meaning of [section 1341a(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341a/a/2]) shall not be taken into account.

            (B) For purposes of this section, a benefit or benefit increase which has been in effect under a plan for less than 60 months before the first day of the plan year for which an amendment reducing the benefit or the benefit increase is taken into account under section 1425(a)(2)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title in determining the minimum contribution requirement for the plan year under section 1423(b)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  of this title is not eligible for the corporation’s guarantee.

        (2)

         For purposes of this section—

            (A)

             the date on which a benefit or a benefit increase under a plan is first in effect is the later of—

                (i) the date on which the documents establishing or increasing the benefit were executed, or

                (ii) the effective date of the benefit or benefit increase;

            (B) the period of time for which a benefit or a benefit increase has been in effect under a successor plan includes the period of time for which the benefit or benefit increase was in effect under a previously established plan; and

            (C) in the case of a plan to which [section 1321 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1321] did not apply on September 3, 1974, the time periods referred to in this section are computed beginning on the date on which [section 1321 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1321] first applies to the plan.

    (c) __Determinations respecting amount of guarantee__ 

        (1)

         Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, the monthly benefit of a participant or a beneficiary which is guaranteed under this section by the corporation with respect to a plan is the product of—

            (A)

             100 percent of the accrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent of the lesser of—

                (i) $33, or

                (ii) the accrual rate, if any, in excess of $11, and

            (B) the number of the participant’s years of credited service.

        (2)

         For purposes of this section, the accrual rate is—

            (A)

             the monthly benefit of the participant or beneficiary which is described in subsection (a) of this section and which is eligible for the corporation’s guarantee under subsection (b) of this section, except that such benefit shall be—

                (i) no greater than the monthly benefit which would be payable under the plan at normal retirement age in the form of a single life annuity, and

                (ii) determined without regard to any reduction under [section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s411/a/3/E]; divided by

            (B) the participant’s years of credited service.

        (3)

         For purposes of this subsection—

            (A)

             a year of credited service is a year in which the participant completed—

                (i) a full year of participation in the plan, or

                (ii) any period of service before participation which is credited for purposes of benefit accrual as the equivalent of a full year of participation;

            (B) any year for which the participant is credited for purposes of benefit accrual with a fraction of the equivalent of a full year of participation shall be counted as such a fraction of a year of credited service; and

            (C) years of credited service shall be determined by including service which may otherwise be disregarded by the plan under [section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s411/a/3/E].

        (4) For purposes of subsection (a), in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in [section 1055(e)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1055/e/1]) payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent under [section 1426(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426/b] or 1441(d)(2) of this title or is terminated, such annuity shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became so insolvent or the termination date.

    (d) __Amount of guarantee of reduced benefit__ 

    In the case of a benefit which has been reduced under [section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s411/a/3/E], the corporation shall guarantee the lesser of—

        (1) the reduced benefit, or

        (2) the amount determined under subsection (c) of this section.

    (e) __Ineligibility of benefits for guarantee__ 

        The corporation shall not guarantee benefits under a multiemployer plan which, under [section 1322(b)(6) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322/b/6], would not be guaranteed under a single-employer plan.

    (f) __Study, report, etc., respecting premium increase in existing basic-benefit guarantee levels; Congressional procedures applicable for revision of schedules__ 

        (1)

         No later than 5 years after September 26, 1980, and at least every fifth year thereafter, the corporation shall—

                (i) the premiums needed to maintain the basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans described in subsection (c) of this section, and

                (ii) whether the basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans may be increased without increasing the basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans under this subchapter; and

            (B) report such determinations to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.

        (2)

            (A)

             If the last report described in paragraph (1) indicates that a premium increase is necessary to support the existing basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans, the corporation shall transmit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by March 31 of any calendar year in which congressional action under this subsection is requested—

                (i) a revised schedule of basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans which would be necessary in the absence of an increase in premiums approved in accordance with [section 1306(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1306/b],

                (ii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans which is necessary to support the existing basic-benefit guarantees for such plans, and

                (iii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans for which the schedule of premiums necessary is higher than the existing premium schedule for such plans but lower than the revised schedule of premiums for such plans specified in clause (ii), together with such schedule of premiums.

            (B) The revised schedule of increased premiums referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii) shall go into effect as approved by the enactment of a joint resolution.

            (C) If an increase in premiums is not so enacted, the revised guarantee schedule described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall go into effect on the first day of the second calendar year following the year in which such revised guarantee schedule was submitted to the Congress.

        (3)

            (A)

             If the last report described in paragraph (1) indicates that basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans can be increased without increasing the basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans under this subchapter, the corporation shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by March 31 of the calendar year in which congressional action under this paragraph is requested—

                (i) a revised schedule of increases in the basic-benefit guarantees which can be supported by the existing schedule of basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans, and

                (ii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit premiums sufficient to support the existing basic-benefit guarantees.

            (B) The revised schedules referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or subparagraph (A)(ii) shall go into effect as approved by the enactment of a joint resolution.

        (4)

            (A) The succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph are enacted by the Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of joint resolutions (as defined in subparagraph (B)). Such subparagraphs shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.

            (B) For purposes of this subsection, “joint resolution” means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: “The proposed schedule described in        transmitted to the Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on        is hereby approved.”, the first blank space therein being filled with “section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974”, “section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974”, “section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974”, or “section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974” (whichever is applicable), and the second blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation’s message proposing the revision was submitted.

            (C) The procedure for disposition of a joint resolution shall be the procedure described in section 1306(b)(4) through (7) of this title.

    (g) __Guarantee of payment of other classes of benefits and establishment of terms and conditions of guarantee; promulgation of regulations for establishment of supplemental program to guarantee benefits otherwise ineligible; status of benefits; applicability of revised schedule of premiums__ 

        (1) The corporation may guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits under multiemployer plans, and establish the terms and conditions under which those other classes of benefits are guaranteed, as it determines to be appropriate.

        (2)

            (A) The corporation shall prescribe regulations to establish a supplemental program to guarantee benefits under multiemployer plans which would be guaranteed under this section but for the limitations in subsection (c) of this section. Such regulations shall be proposed by the corporation no later than the end of the 18th calendar month following September 26, 1980. The regulations shall make coverage under the supplemental program available no later than January 1, 1983. Any election to participate in the supplemental program shall be on a voluntary basis, and a plan electing such coverage shall continue to pay the premiums required under [section 1306(a)(2)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1306/a/2/B] to the revolving fund used pursuant to [section 1305 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1305] in connection with benefits otherwise guaranteed under this section.

                (i) that a plan must elect coverage under the supplemental program within the time permitted by the regulations;

                (ii) unless the corporation determines otherwise, that a plan may not elect supplemental coverage unless the value of the assets of the plan as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the election must be made is an amount equal to 15 times the total amount of the benefit payments made under the plan for that year; and

                (iii) such other reasonable terms and conditions for supplemental coverage, including funding standards and any other reasonable limitations with respect to plans or benefits covered or to means of program financing, as the corporation determines are necessary and appropriate for a feasible supplemental program consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.

        (3) Any benefits guaranteed under this subsection shall be considered nonbasic benefits for purposes of this subchapter.

        (4)

            (A)

             No revised schedule of premiums under this subsection, after the initial schedule, shall go into effect unless—

                (i) the revised schedule is submitted to the Congress, and

            (C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “legislative day” means any calendar day other than a day on which either House is not in session because of a sine die adjournment or an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain.

        (5) Regulations prescribed by the corporation to carry out the provisions of this subsection, may, to the extent provided therein, supersede the requirements of sections 1426, 1431, and 1441 of this title, and the requirements of [section 418E of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s418E], but only with respect to benefits guaranteed under this subsection.

    (h) __Applicability to nonforfeitable benefits accrued as of__  __July 30, 1980__  __; manner and extent of guarantee__ 

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply with respect to the nonforfeitable benefits accrued as of July 29, 1980, with respect to a participant or beneficiary under a multiemployer plan—

        (1) who is in pay status on July 29, 1980, or

        (2) who is within 36 months of the normal retirement age and has a nonforfeitable right to a pension as of that date.

        (2) The benefits described in paragraph (1) shall be guaranteed by the corporation in the same manner and to the same extent as benefits are guaranteed by the corporation under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322] (without regard to this section).

        (3)
