    (b) __Maintenance of plan of predecessor employer__ 

    For purposes of this part and part 3—

        (1) in any case in which the employer maintains a plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall be treated as service for the employer, and

        (2) in any case in which the employer maintains a plan which is not the plan maintained by a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, be treated as service for the employer.

Probably should be “is”. </sup></sup>  part of an eligible combined plan in the same manner as if each such plan were not a part of the eligible combined plan. In the case of a termination of the defined benefit plan and the applicable defined contribution plan forming part of an eligible combined plan, the plan administrator shall terminate each such plan separately.

        (2) __Eligible combined plan__ 

        For purposes of this subsection—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The term “eligible combined plan” means a plan—

                (i) which is maintained by an employer which, at the time the plan is established, is a small employer,

                (ii) which consists of a defined benefit plan and an applicable individual account plan each of which qualifies under [section 401(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s401/a],

            (B) __Benefit requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__

For purposes of this clause, final average pay shall be determined using the period of consecutive years (not exceeding 5) during which the participant had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer.

                (ii) __Applicable percentage__ 

                For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage is the lesser of—

                    (I) 1 percent multiplied by the number of years of service with the employer, or

                    (II) 20 percent.

                (iii) __Special rule for applicable defined benefit plans__ 

                    If the defined benefit plan under clause (i) is an applicable defined benefit plan as defined in [section 1053(f)(3)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1053/f/3/B] which meets the interest credit requirements of [section 1054(b)(5)(B)(i) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/b/5/B/i], the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) with respect to any plan year if each participant receives pay credit for the year which is not less than the percentage of compensation determined in accordance with the following table:

<table>

                      <tr>

                        <td> 

                      If the participant’s age as of the

                       beginning of the year is—  </td>

                        <td> 

                    The percentage is—  </td>

  </tr>

                      <tr>

                        <td>

  </tr>

                      <tr>

                        <td> 

                    40 or over but less than 50  </td>

            (C) __Contribution requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The contribution requirements of this subparagraph with respect to any applicable individual account plan forming part of an eligible combined plan are met if—

                (ii) __Nonelective contributions__ 

                    An applicable individual account plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) because the employer makes nonelective contributions under the plan but such contributions shall not be taken into account in determining whether the requirements of clause (i)(II) are met.

            (D) __Vesting requirements__ 

            The vesting requirements of this subparagraph are met if—

                (i) in the case of a defined benefit plan forming part of an eligible combined plan an employee who has completed at least 3 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee’s accrued benefit under the plan derived from employer contributions, and

            (E) __Uniform provision of contributions and benefits__
