## § 1461. Effective date; special rules

    (a) The provisions of this subchapter take effect on September 2, 1974.

    (b)

     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the corporation shall pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to any plan—

        (1) which is not a multiemployer plan,

        (2) which terminates after June 30, 1974, and before September 2, 1974,

        (3) to which [section 1321 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1321] would apply if that section were effective beginning on July 1, 1974, and

        (4) with respect to which a notice is filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than 10 days after September 2, 1974, except that, for reasonable cause shown, such notice may be filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than October 31, 1974, stating that the plan is a plan described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).

        The corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a plan described in the preceding sentence unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter or for the purpose of avoiding the liability which might be imposed under subtitle D if the plan terminated on or after September 2, 1974. The provisions of subtitle D do not apply in the case of such a plan which terminates before September 2, 1974. For purposes of determining whether a plan is a plan described in paragraph (2), the provisions of [section 1348 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1348] shall not apply, but the corporation shall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.

    (c)

        (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980. Whenever the corporation exercises the authority granted under paragraph (2) or (3), the corporation shall notify the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and the Committee on Finance of the Senate.

        (2)

         The corporation may, in its discretion, pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates after September 2, 1974 and before August 1, 1980, if—

            (A) the plan was maintained during the 60 months immediately preceding the date on which the plan terminates, and

            (B) the corporation determines that the payment by the corporation of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to that plan will not jeopardize the payments the corporation anticipates it may be required to make in connection with benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980.

        (3)

         Notwithstanding any provision of section 1321 or 1322 of this title which would prevent such payments, the corporation, in carrying out its authority under paragraph (2), may pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan described in paragraph (2) in any case in which those benefits would otherwise not be payable if—

            (A) the plan has been in effect for at least 5 years,

            (B) the plan has been in substantial compliance with the funding requirements for a qualified plan with respect to the employees and former employees in those employment units on the basis of which the participating employers have contributed to the plan for the preceding 5 years, and

            (C) the participating employers and employee organization or organizations had no reasonable recourse other than termination.

        (4)

         If the corporation determines, under paragraph (2) or (3), that it will pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980, the corporation—

            (A) may establish requirements for the continuation of payments which commenced before January 2, 1974, with respect to retired participants under the plan,

            (B) may not, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, make payments with respect to any participant under such a plan who, on January 1, 1974, was receiving payment of retirement benefits, in excess of the amounts and rates payable with respect to such participant on that date,

            (C) shall review from time to time payments made under the authority granted to it by paragraphs (2) and (3), and reduce or terminate such payments to the extent necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of the corporation to make payments of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980, without increasing premium rates for such plans.

    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, guaranteed benefits payable by the corporation pursuant to its discretionary authority under this section shall continue to be paid at the level guaranteed under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322], without regard to any limitation on payment under subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(4).

    (e)

        (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the amendments to this chapter made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 shall take effect on September 26, 1980.

        (2)

            (A) Except as provided in this paragraph, part 1 of subtitle E, relating to withdrawal liability, takes effect on September 26, 1980.

            (B) For purposes of determining withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E, an employer who has withdrawn from a plan shall be considered to have withdrawn from a multiemployer plan if, at the time of the withdrawal, the plan was a multiemployer plan as defined in [section 1301(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1301/a/3] as in effect at the time of the withdrawal.

        (3)

         Sections 1421 through 1426  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of this title, relating to multiemployer plan reorganization, shall take effect, with respect to each plan, on the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after the earlier of—

            (A) the date on which the last collective bargaining agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan, which was in effect on September 26, 1980, expires, without regard to extensions agreed to on or after September 26, 1980, or

            (B) 3 years after September 26, 1980.

        (4) [Section 1415 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1415] shall take effect on September 26, 1980.

    (f)

        (1)

         In the event that before September 26, 1980, the corporation has determined that—

            (A) an employer has withdrawn from a multiemployer plan under [section 1363 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1363], and

            (B) the employer is liable to the corporation under such section,

            the corporation shall retain the amount of liability paid to it or furnished in the form of a bond and shall pay such liability to the plan in the event the plan terminates in accordance with [section 1341a(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341a/a/2] before the earlier of September 26, 1985, or the day after the 5-year period commencing on the date of such withdrawal.

        (2) In any case in which the plan is not so terminated within the period described in paragraph (1), the liability of the employer is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest to the employer or the employer’s bond shall be cancelled.

    (g)

        (1)

         In any case in which an employer or employers withdrew from a multiemployer plan before the effective date of part 1 of subtitle E, the corporation may—

            (A) apply [section 1363(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1363/d], as in effect before the amendments made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, to such plan,

            (B) assess liability against the withdrawn employer with respect to the resulting terminated plan,

            (C) guarantee benefits under the terminated plan under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322], as in effect before such amendments, and

            (D) if necessary, enforce such action through suit brought under [section 1303 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1303].

        (2) The corporation shall use the revolving fund used by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed under [section 1322a of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322a] in guaranteeing benefits under a terminated plan described in this subsection.

    (h)

        (1)

         In the case of an employer who entered into a collective bargaining agreement—

            (A) which was effective on January 12, 1979, and which remained in effect through May 15, 1982, and

            (B) under which contributions to a multiemployer plan were to cease on January 12, 1982,

            any withdrawal liability incurred by the employer pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E as a result of the complete or partial withdrawal of the employer from the multiemployer plan before January 16, 1982, shall be void.

        (2)

         In any case in which—

            (A)

             an employer engaged in the grocery wholesaling business—

                (i) had ceased all covered operations under a multiemployer plan before June 30, 1981, and had relocated its operations to a new facility in another State, and

                (ii) had notified a local union representative on May 14, 1980, that the employer had tentatively decided to discontinue operations and relocate to a new facility in another State, and
