    (a) __In general__

    (b) __Hearing__ 

        A person that is adversely affected by the issuance of a cease and desist order under subsection (a) may request a hearing by the Secretary regarding such order. The Secretary may require that a proceeding under this section, including all related information and evidence, be conducted in a confidential manner.

    (d) __Determination__ 

        Based upon the evidence presented at a hearing under subsection (b), the cease and desist order involved may be affirmed, modified, or set aside by the Secretary in whole or in part.

    (e) __Seizure__ 

        The Secretary may issue a summary seizure order under this subchapter if it appears that a multiple employer welfare arrangement is in a financially hazardous condition.

    (f) __Regulations__
