## § 1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation

    (a) __Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan__ 

    The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that—

        (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under [section 412 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s412], or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under [section 6212 of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s6212] has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under [section 4971(a) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s4971/a],

        (2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,

        (3) the reportable event described in [section 1343(c)(7) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1343/c/7] has occurred, or

        (4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.

        The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.

    (b) __Appointment of trustee__ 

        (1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.

        (2)

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter—

            (A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and

            (B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which [section 1341a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341a/d] applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.

        (3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).

    (c) __Adjudication that plan must be terminated__ 

        (1) If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.

        (2) In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of [section 1341(c)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341/c/2/A].

        (3) __Disclosure of termination information.—__ 

            (A) __In general.—__ 

                (i)  __Information from plan sponsor or administrator__  __.—__ 

                A plan sponsor or plan administrator of a single-employer plan that has received a notice from the corporation of a determination that the plan should be terminated under this section shall provide to an affected party any information provided to the corporation in connection with the plan termination.

                (ii)  __Information from corporation__  __.—__ 

                The corporation shall provide a copy of the administrative record, including the trusteeship decision record of a termination of a plan described under clause (i).

            (B)  __Timing of disclosure__  __.—__ 

            The plan sponsor, plan administrator, or the corporation, as applicable, shall provide the information described in subparagraph (A) not later than 15 days after—

                A court may limit disclosure under this paragraph of confidential information described in [section 552(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b] to authorized representatives (within the meaning of [section 1341(c)(2)(D)(iv) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341/c/2/D/iv]) of the participants or beneficiaries that agree to ensure the confidentiality of such information.

            (D) __Form and manner of information; charges.—__ 

                (i)  __Form and manner__  __.—__ 

                The corporation may prescribe the form and manner of the provision of information under this paragraph, which shall include delivery in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent that such form is reasonably accessible to individuals to whom the information is required to be provided.

                (iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;

                (vi) to do such other acts as he deems necessary to continue operation of the plan without increasing the potential liability of the corporation, if such acts may be done under the provisions of the plan; and

                (vii) to require the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, any contributing or withdrawn employer, and any employee organization representing plan participants to furnish any information with respect to the plan which the trustee may reasonably need in order to administer the plan.
