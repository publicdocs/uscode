If coverage is modified under the plan for any group of similarly situated beneficiaries, such coverage shall also be modified in the same manner for all individuals who are qualified beneficiaries under the plan pursuant to this part in connection with such group.

    (2) __Period of coverage__ 

    The coverage must extend for at least the period beginning on the date of the qualifying event and ending not earlier than the earliest of the following:

            (iii) __Special rule for certain bankruptcy proceedings__ 

                In the case of a qualifying event described in [section 1163(6) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1163/6] (relating to bankruptcy proceedings), the date of the death of the covered employee or qualified beneficiary (described in [section 1167(3)(C)(iii) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1167/3/C/iii]), or in the case of the surviving spouse or dependent children of the covered employee, 36 months after the date of the death of the covered employee.

The preceding sentence shall not require any period of coverage to extend beyond January 1, 2014.

            (vi) __Special rule for TAA-eligible individuals__ 

                In the case of a qualifying event described in [section 1163(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1163/2] with respect to a covered employee who is (as of the date that the period of coverage would, but for this clause or clause (vii), otherwise terminate under clause (i) or (ii)) a TAA-eligible individual (as defined in [section 1165(b)(4)(B) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1165/b/4/B]), the period of coverage shall not terminate by reason of clause (i) or (ii), as the case may be, before the later of the date specified in such clause or the date on which such individual ceases to be such a TAA-eligible individual.

    (3) __Premium requirements__ 

    The plan may require payment of a premium for any period of continuation coverage, except that such premium—

        (A) shall not exceed 102 percent of the applicable premium for such period, and

        (B) may, at the election of the payor, be made in monthly installments.

        In no event may the plan require the payment of any premium before the day which is 45 days after the day on which the qualified beneficiary made the initial election for continuation coverage. In the case of an individual described in the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A), any reference in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to “102 percent” is deemed a reference to “150 percent” for any month after the 18th month of continuation coverage described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (2)(A).
