## § 1085. Additional funding rules for multiemployer plans in endangered status or critical status

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of this part, in the case of a multiemployer plan in effect on July 16, 2006—

        (1)

         if the plan is in endangered status—

            (A) the plan sponsor shall adopt and implement a funding improvement plan in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c), and

            (B) the requirements of subsection (d) shall apply during the funding plan adoption period and the funding improvement period,

        (2)

         if the plan is in critical status—

            (A) the plan sponsor shall adopt and implement a rehabilitation plan in accordance with the requirements of subsection (e), and

            (B) the requirements of subsection (f) shall apply during the rehabilitation plan adoption period and the rehabilitation period, and

        (3)

         if the plan is in critical and declining status—

            (A) the requirements of paragraph (2) shall apply to the plan; and

            (B) the plan sponsor may, by plan amendment, suspend benefits in accordance with the requirements of subsection (e)(9).

    (b) __Determination of endangered and critical status__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Endangered status__ 

        A multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year if, as determined by the plan actuary under paragraph (3), the plan is not in critical status for the plan year and is not described in paragraph (5), and, as of the beginning of the plan year, either—

            (A) the plan’s funded percentage for such plan year is less than 80 percent, or

            (B) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for such plan year, or is projected to have such an accumulated funding deficiency for any of the 6 succeeding plan years, taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            For purposes of this section, a plan shall be treated as in seriously endangered status for a plan year if the plan is described in both subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2) __Critical status__ 

        A multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year if, as determined by the plan actuary under paragraph (3), the plan is described in 1 or more of the following subparagraphs as of the beginning of the plan year:

            (A)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i) the funded percentage of the plan is less than 65 percent, and

                (ii)

                 the sum of—

                    (I) the fair market value of plan assets, plus

                    (II) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of all collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years,

                 is less than the present value of all nonforfeitable benefits projected to be payable under the plan during the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years (plus administrative expenses for such plan years).

            (B)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for the current plan year, not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d], or

                (ii) the plan is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for any of the 3 succeeding plan years (4 succeeding plan years if the funded percentage of the plan is 65 percent or less), not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            (C)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i)

                    (I) the plan’s normal cost for the current plan year, plus interest (determined at the rate used for determining costs under the plan) for the current plan year on the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan as of the last date of the preceding plan year, exceeds

                    (II) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer and employee contributions for the current plan year,

                (ii) the present value, as of the beginning of the current plan year, of nonforfeitable benefits of inactive participants is greater than the present value of nonforfeitable benefits of active participants, and

                (iii) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for the current plan year, or is projected to have such a deficiency for any of the 4 succeeding plan years, not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            (D)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if the sum of—

                (i) the fair market value of plan assets, plus

                (ii) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current plan year and each of the 4 succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of all collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years,

                is less than the present value of all benefits projected to be payable under the plan during the current plan year and each of the 4 succeeding plan years (plus administrative expenses for such plan years).

        (3) __Annual certification by plan actuary__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Not later than the 90th day of each plan year of a multiemployer plan, the plan actuary shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the plan sponsor—

                (i) whether or not the plan is in endangered status for such plan year, or would be in endangered status for such plan year but for paragraph (5),, <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. </sup></sup>  whether or not the plan is or will be in critical status for such plan year or for any of the succeeding 5 plan years, and whether or not the plan is or will be in critical and declining status for such plan year, and

                (ii) in the case of a plan which is in a funding improvement or rehabilitation period, whether or not the plan is making the scheduled progress in meeting the requirements of its funding improvement or rehabilitation plan.

            (B) __Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Except as provided in clause (iv), in making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary’s projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either—

                    (I) the actuarial statement required under [section 1023(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1023/d] with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or

                    (II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.

                (ii) __Determinations of future contributions__ 

                Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume—

                    (I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or

                    (II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.

                (iii) __Projected industry activity__ 

                    Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.

                (iv)  __ <sup>\[__  __2__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __2__  __ So in original. Two cls. (iv) have been enacted.__  __ </sup></sup> __  __Projections relating to critical status in succeeding plan years__ 

                    Clauses (i) and (ii) (other than the 2nd sentence of clause (i)) may be disregarded by a plan actuary in the case of any certification of whether a plan will be in critical status in a succeeding plan year, except that a plan sponsor may not elect to be in critical status for a plan year under paragraph (4) in any case in which the certification upon which such election would be based is made without regard to such clauses.

                (iv)  __2__  __Projections of critical and declining status__ 

                In determining whether a plan is in critical and declining status as described in subsection (e)(9), clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall apply, except that—

                    (I) if reasonable, the plan actuary shall assume that each contributing employer in compliance continues to comply through the end of the rehabilitation period or such later time as provided in subsection (e)(3)(A)(ii) with the terms of the rehabilitation plan that correspond to the schedule adopted or imposed under subsection (e), and

                    (II) the plan actuary shall take into account any suspensions of benefits described in subsection (e)(9) adopted in a prior plan year that are still in effect.

            (C) __Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification__ 

                Any failure of the plan’s actuary to certify the plan’s status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of [section 1132(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1132/c/2] as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under [section 1021(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1021/b/1].

            (D) __Notice__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In any case in which it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in endangered or critical status for a plan year or in which a plan sponsor elects to be in critical status for a plan year under paragraph (4), the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the endangered or critical status to the participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Secretary. In any case in which a plan sponsor elects to be in critical status for a plan year under paragraph (4), the plan sponsor shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of such election not later than 30 days after the date of such certification or such other time as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulations or other guidance.

                (ii) __Plans in critical status__ 

                If it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in critical status, the plan sponsor shall include in the notice under clause (i) an explanation of the possibility that—

                    (I) adjustable benefits (as defined in subsection (e)(8)) may be reduced, and

                    (II) such reductions may apply to participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is on or after the date such notice is provided for the first plan year in which the plan is in critical status.

                (iii) In the case of a multiemployer plan that would be in endangered status but for paragraph (5), the plan sponsor shall provide notice to the bargaining parties and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that the plan would be in endangered status but for such paragraph.

                (iv) __Model notice__ 

                    The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup>  shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clauses (ii) and (iii).

                (v) __Notice of projection to be in critical status in a future plan year__ 

                    In any case in which it is certified under subparagraph (A)(i) that a multiemployer plan will be in critical status for any of 5 succeeding plan years (but not for the current plan year) and the plan sponsor of such plan has not made an election to be in critical status for the plan year under paragraph (4), the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the projected critical status to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

        (4) __Election to be in critical status__ 

        Notwithstanding paragraph (2) and subject to paragraph (3)(B)(iv)—

            (A) the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is not in critical status for a plan year but that is projected by the plan actuary, pursuant to the determination under paragraph (3), to be in critical status in any of the succeeding 5 plan years may, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification under paragraph (3)(A), elect to be in critical status effective for the current plan year,

            (B) the plan year in which the plan sponsor elects to be in critical status under subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of this section as the first year in which the plan is in critical status, regardless of the date on which the plan first satisfies the criteria for critical status under paragraph (2), and

            (C) a plan that is in critical status under this paragraph shall not emerge from critical status except in accordance with subsection (e)(4)(B).

        (5) __Special rule__ 

        A plan is described in this paragraph if—

            (A) as part of the actuarial certification of endangered status under paragraph (3)(A) for the plan year, the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to no longer be described in either paragraph (1)(A) or paragraph (1)(B) as of the end of the tenth plan year ending after the plan year to which the certification relates, and

            (B) the plan was not in critical or endangered status for the immediately preceding plan year.

        (6) __Critical and declining status__ 

            For purposes of this section, a plan in critical status shall be treated as in critical and declining status if the plan is described in one or more of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (2) and the plan is projected to become insolvent within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426] during the current plan year or any of the 14 succeeding plan years (19 succeeding plan years if the plan has a ratio of inactive participants to active participants that exceeds 2 to 1 or if the funded percentage of the plan is less than 80 percent).

    (c) __Funding improvement plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—

            (A) shall adopt a funding improvement plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certification of endangered status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and

            (B)

             within 30 days after the adoption of the funding improvement plan—

                (i)

                 shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan, including—

                    (I) one proposal for reductions in the amount of future benefit accruals necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments increasing contributions under the plan (other than amendments increasing contributions necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks after amendments have reduced future benefit accruals to the maximum extent permitted by law), and

                    (II) one proposal for increases in contributions under the plan necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments reducing future benefit accruals under the plan, and

                (ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to achieving the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan.

                For purposes of this section, the term “applicable benchmarks” means the requirements applicable to the multiemployer plan under paragraph (3) (as modified by paragraph (5)).

        (2) __Exception for years after process begins__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period by reason of the plan being in endangered status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial determination year with respect to the funding improvement plan to which it relates.

        (3) __Funding improvement plan__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            A funding improvement plan is a plan which consists of the actions, including options or a range of options to be proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated to provide, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, for the attainment by the plan during the funding improvement period of the following requirements:

                (i) __Increase in plan’s funding percentage__ 

                The plan’s funded percentage as of the close of the funding improvement period equals or exceeds a percentage equal to the sum of—

                    (I) such percentage as of the beginning of the first plan year for which the plan is certified to be in endangered status pursuant to paragraph (b)(3), plus

                    (II) 33 percent of the difference between 100 percent and the percentage under subclause (I).

                (ii) __Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiencies__ 

                    No accumulated funding deficiency for the last plan year during the funding improvement period (taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d]).

            (B) __Seriously endangered plans__ 

                In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall be applied by substituting “20 percent” for “33 percent”.

        (4) __Funding improvement period__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The funding improvement period for any funding improvement plan adopted pursuant to this subsection is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan beginning after the earlier of—

                (i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the funding improvement plan, or

                (ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of endangered status for the initial determination year under subsection (b)(3)(A) and covering, as of such due date, at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.

            (B) __Seriously endangered plans__ 

                In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “15-year period” for “10-year period”.

            (C) __Coordination with changes in status__ 

                (i) __Plans no longer in endangered status__ 

                    If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is no longer in endangered status and is not in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the preceding plan year.

                (ii) __Plans in critical status__ 

                    If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the plan year preceding the first plan year in the rehabilitation period with respect to such status.

            (D) __Plans in endangered status at end of period__ 

                If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the first plan year following the close of the period described in subparagraph (A) that the plan is in endangered status, the provisions of this subsection and subsection (d) shall be applied as if such first plan year were an initial determination year, except that the plan may not be amended in a manner inconsistent with the funding improvement plan in effect for the preceding plan year until a new funding improvement plan is adopted.

        (5) __Special rules for seriously endangered plans more than 70 percent funded__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the funded percentage of a plan in seriously endangered status was more than 70 percent as of the beginning of the initial determination year—

                (i) paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall apply only if the plan’s actuary certifies, within 30 days after the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year, that, based on the terms of the plan and the collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of such certification, the plan is not projected to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), and

                (ii) if there is a certification under clause (i), the plan may, in formulating its funding improvement plan, only take into account the rules of paragraph (3)(B) and (4)(B) for plan years in the funding improvement period beginning on or before the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreements described in paragraph (4)(A)(ii) expires.

            (B) __Special rule after expiration of agreements__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(ii), if, for any plan year ending after the date described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the plan actuary certifies (at the time of the annual certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for such plan year) that, based on the terms of the plan and collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of that annual certification, the plan is not projected to be able to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall continue to apply for such year.

        (6) __Updates to funding improvement plan and schedules__ 

            (A) __Funding improvement plan__ 

                The plan sponsor shall annually update the funding improvement plan and shall file the update with the plan’s annual report under [section 1024 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1024].

            (B) __Schedules__ 

                The plan sponsor shall annually update any schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection to reflect the experience of the plan.

            (C) __Duration of schedule__ 

                A schedule of contribution rates provided by the plan sponsor and relied upon by bargaining parties in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect for the duration of that collective bargaining agreement.

        (7) __Imposition of schedule where failure to adopt funding improvement plan__ 

            (A) __Initial contribution schedule__ 

            If—

                (i) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered endangered status expires, and

                (ii) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,

                the plan sponsor shall implement the schedule described in paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I) beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (C).

            (B) __Subsequent contribution schedule__ 

            If—

                (i) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan in accordance with a schedule provided by the plan sponsor pursuant to a funding improvement plan (or imposed under subparagraph (A)) expires while the plan is still in endangered status, and

                (ii) after receiving one or more updated schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (6)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the updated funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,

                then the contribution schedule applicable under the expired collective bargaining agreement, as updated and in effect on the date the collective bargaining agreement expires, shall be implemented by the plan sponsor beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (C).

            (C) __Date of implementation__ 

                The date specified in this subparagraph is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in subparagraph (A) or (B) expires.

            (D) __Failure to make scheduled contributions__ 

                Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this paragraph shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [section 1145 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1145] and shall be enforceable as such.

        (8) __Funding plan adoption period__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “funding plan adoption period” means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year and ending on the day before the first day of the funding improvement period.

    (d) __Rules for operation of plan during adoption and improvement periods__ 

        (1) __Compliance with funding improvement plan__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan under subsection (c) so as to be inconsistent with the funding improvement plan.

            (B) __Special rules for benefit increases__ 

                A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan under subsection (c) so as to increase benefits, including future benefit accruals, unless the plan actuary certifies that such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not contemplated by the funding improvement plan, and, after taking into account the benefit increase, the multiemployer plan still is reasonably expected to meet the applicable benchmark on the schedule contemplated in the funding improvement plan.

        (2) __Special rules for plan adoption period__ 

        During the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year and ending on the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan—

            (A)

             the plan sponsor may not accept a collective bargaining agreement or participation agreement with respect to the multiemployer plan that provides for—

                (i) a reduction in the level of contributions for any participants,

                (ii) a suspension of contributions with respect to any period of service, or

                (iii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation, and

            (B) no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan may be adopted unless the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.

    (e) __Rehabilitation plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—

            (A) shall adopt a rehabilitation plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certification of critical status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and

            (B)

             within 30 days after the adoption of the rehabilitation plan—

                (i) shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan, and

                (ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to emerging from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.

            The schedule or schedules described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall reflect reductions in future benefit accruals and adjustable benefits, and increases in contributions, that the plan sponsor determines are reasonably necessary to emerge from critical status. One schedule shall be designated as the default schedule and such schedule shall assume that there are no increases in contributions under the plan other than the increases necessary to emerge from critical status after future benefit accruals and other benefits (other than benefits the reduction or elimination of which are not permitted under [section 1054(g) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/g]) have been reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

        (2) __Exception for years after process begins__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a rehabilitation plan adoption period or rehabilitation period by reason of the plan being in critical status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial critical year with respect to the rehabilitation plan to which it relates.

        (3) __Rehabilitation plan__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            A rehabilitation plan is a plan which consists of—

                (i) actions, including options or a range of options to be proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to cease to be in critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period and may include reductions in plan expenditures (including plan mergers and consolidations), reductions in future benefit accruals or increases in contributions, if agreed to by the bargaining parties, or any combination of such actions, or

                (ii) if the plan sponsor determines that, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions and upon exhaustion of all reasonable measures, the plan can not reasonably be expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, reasonable measures to emerge from critical status at a later time or to forestall possible insolvency (within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426]).

                A rehabilitation plan must provide annual standards for meeting the requirements of such rehabilitation plan. Such plan shall also include the schedules required to be provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i) and if clause (ii) applies, shall set forth the alternatives considered, explain why the plan is not reasonably expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, and specify when, if ever, the plan is expected to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.

            (B) __Updates to rehabilitation plan and schedules__ 

                (i) __Rehabilitation plan__ 

                    The plan sponsor shall annually update the rehabilitation plan and shall file the update with the plan’s annual report under [section 1024 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1024].

                (ii) __Schedules__ 

                    The plan sponsor shall annually update any schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection to reflect the experience of the plan.

                (iii) __Duration of schedule__ 

                    A schedule of contribution rates provided by the plan sponsor and relied upon by bargaining parties in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect for the duration of that collective bargaining agreement.

            (C) __Imposition of schedule where failure to adopt rehabilitation plan__ 

                (i) __Initial contribution schedule__ 

                If—

                    (I) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered critical status expires, and

                    (II) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i),

                 the plan sponsor shall implement the schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) beginning on the date specified in clause (iii).

                (ii) __Subsequent contribution schedule__ 

                If—

                    (I) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan in accordance with a schedule provided by the plan sponsor pursuant to a rehabilitation plan (or imposed under subparagraph (C)(i)) expires while the plan is still in critical status, and

                    (II) after receiving one or more updated schedules from the plan sponsor under subparagraph (B)(ii), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the updated rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,

                 then the contribution schedule applicable under the expired collective bargaining agreement, as updated and in effect on the date the collective bargaining agreement expires, shall be implemented by the plan sponsor beginning on the date specified in clause (iii).

                (iii) __Date of implementation__ 

                    The date specified in this subparagraph is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in clause (i) or (ii) expires.

                (iv) __Failure to make scheduled contributions__ 

                    Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [section 1145 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1145] and shall be enforceable as such.

        (4) __Rehabilitation period__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The rehabilitation period for a plan in critical status is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan following the earlier of—

                (i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the rehabilitation plan, or

                (ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of critical status for the initial critical year under subsection (a)(1) and covering, as of such date at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.

                If a plan emerges from critical status as provided under subparagraph (B) before the end of such 10-year period, the rehabilitation period shall end with the plan year preceding the plan year for which the determination under subparagraph (B) is made.

            (B) __Emergence__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                A plan in critical status shall remain in such status until a plan year for which the plan actuary certifies, in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), that—

                    (I) the plan is not described in one or more of the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(2) as of the beginning of the plan year;

                    (II) the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d/2] or [section 1084 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084] (as in effect prior to the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006); and

                    (III) the plan is not projected to become insolvent within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426] for any of the 30 succeeding plan years.

                (ii) __Plans with certain amortization extensions__ 

                    (I) __Special emergence rule__ 

                    Notwithstanding clause (i), a plan in critical status that has an automatic extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d/1] shall no longer be in critical status if the plan actuary certifies for a plan year, in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), that—

                        (aa) the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d/1]; and

                        (bb) the plan is not projected to become insolvent within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426] for any of the 30 succeeding plan years,

                 regardless of whether the plan is described in one or more of the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(2) as of the beginning of the plan year.

            (II) __Reentry into critical status__ 

            A plan that emerges from critical status under subclause (I) shall not reenter critical status for any subsequent plan year unless—

                (aa) the plan is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d]; or

                (bb) the plan is projected to become insolvent within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426] for any of the 30 succeeding plan years.

        (5) __Rehabilitation plan adoption period__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “rehabilitation plan adoption period” means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial critical year and ending on the day before the first day of the rehabilitation period.

        (6) __Limitation on reduction in rates of future accruals__ 

        Any reduction in the rate of future accruals under the default schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) shall not reduce the rate of future accruals below—

            (A) a monthly benefit (payable as a single life annuity commencing at the participant’s normal retirement age) equal to 1 percent of the contributions required to be made with respect to a participant, or the equivalent standard accrual rate for a participant or group of participants under the collective bargaining agreements in effect as of the first day of the initial critical year, or

            (B) if lower, the accrual rate under the plan on such first day.

            The equivalent standard accrual rate shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representative for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise described in this paragraph.

        (7) __Automatic employer surcharge__ 

            (A) __Imposition of surcharge__ 

                Each employer otherwise obligated to make contributions for the initial critical year shall be obligated to pay to the plan for such year a surcharge equal to 5 percent of the contributions otherwise required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes). For each succeeding plan year in which the plan is in critical status for a consecutive period of years beginning with the initial critical year, the surcharge shall be 10 percent of the contributions otherwise so required.

            (B) __Enforcement of surcharge__ 

                The surcharges under subparagraph (A) shall be due and payable on the same schedule as the contributions on which the surcharges are based. Any failure to make a surcharge payment shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [section 1145 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1145] and shall be enforceable as such.

            (C) __Surcharge to terminate upon collective bargaining agreement renegotiation__ 

                The surcharge under this paragraph shall cease to be effective with respect to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes), beginning on the effective date of a collective bargaining agreement (or other such agreement) that includes terms consistent with a schedule presented by the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i), as modified under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3).

            (D) __Surcharge not to apply until employer receives notice__ 

                The surcharge under this paragraph shall not apply to an employer until 30 days after the employer has been notified by the plan sponsor that the plan is in critical status and that the surcharge is in effect.

            (E) __Surcharge not to generate increased benefit accruals__ 

                Notwithstanding any provision of a plan to the contrary, the amount of any surcharge under this paragraph shall not be the basis for any benefit accrual under the plan.

        (8) __Benefit adjustments__ 

            (A) __Adjustable benefits__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    Notwithstanding [section 1054(g) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/g], the plan sponsor shall, subject to the notice requirements in subparagraph (C), make any reductions to adjustable benefits which the plan sponsor deems appropriate, based upon the outcome of collective bargaining over the schedule or schedules provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i).

                (ii) __Exception for retirees__ 

                    Except in the case of adjustable benefits described in clause (iv)(III), the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status shall not reduce adjustable benefits of any participant or beneficiary whose benefit commencement date is before the date on which the plan provides notice to the participant or beneficiary under subsection (b)(3)(D) for the initial critical year.

                (iii) __Plan sponsor flexibility__ 

                    The plan sponsor shall include in the schedules provided to the bargaining parties an allowance for funding the benefits of participants with respect to whom contributions are not currently required to be made, and shall reduce their benefits to the extent permitted under this subchapter and considered appropriate by the plan sponsor based on the plan’s then current overall funding status.

                (iv) __Adjustable benefit defined__ 

                For purposes of this paragraph, the term “adjustable benefit” means—

                    (I) benefits, rights, and features under the plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet in pay status, and similar benefits,

                    (II) any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy (within the meaning of [section 1054(g)(2)(A) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/g/2/A]) and any benefit payment option (other than the qualified joint and survivor annuity), and

                    (III) benefit increases that would not be eligible for a guarantee under [section 1322a of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322a] on the first day of initial critical year because the increases were adopted (or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months before such first day.

            (B) __Normal retirement benefits protected__ 

                Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iv)(III), nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to permit a plan to reduce the level of a participant’s accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age.

            (C) __Notice requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                No reduction may be made to adjustable benefits under subparagraph (A) unless notice of such reduction has been given at least 30 days before the general effective date of such reduction for all participants and beneficiaries to—

                    (I) plan participants and beneficiaries,

                    (II) each employer who has an obligation to contribute (within the meaning of [section 1392(a) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1392/a]) under the plan, and

                    (III) each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by such an employer.

                (ii) __Content of notice__ 

                The notice under clause (i) shall contain—

                    (I) sufficient information to enable participants and beneficiaries to understand the effect of any reduction on their benefits, including an estimate (on an annual or monthly basis) of any affected adjustable benefit that a participant or beneficiary would otherwise have been eligible for as of the general effective date described in clause (i), and

                    (II) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance where appropriate.

                (iii) __Form and manner__ 

                Any notice under clause (i)—

                    (I) shall be provided in a form and manner prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary,

                    (II) shall be written in a manner so as to be understood by the average plan participant, and

                    (III) may be provided in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent such form is reasonably accessible to persons to whom the notice is required to be provided.

                 The Secretary of the Treasury shall in the regulations prescribed under subclause (I) establish a model notice that a plan sponsor may use to meet the requirements of this subparagraph.

        (9) __Benefit suspensions for multiemployer plans in critical and declining status__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

                Notwithstanding [section 1054(g) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/g] and subject to subparagraphs (B) through (I), the plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status may, by plan amendment, suspend benefits which the sponsor deems appropriate.

                (ii) __Length of suspensions__ 

                    Any suspension of benefits made under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect until the earlier of when the plan sponsor provides benefit improvements in accordance with subparagraph (E) or the suspension of benefits expires by its own terms.

                (iii) __No liability__ 

                    The plan shall not be liable for any benefit payments not made as a result of a suspension of benefits under this paragraph.

                (iv) __Applicability__ 

                    For purposes of this paragraph, all references to suspensions of benefits, increases in benefits, or resumptions of suspended benefits with respect to participants shall also apply with respect to benefits of beneficiaries or alternative payees of participants.

                (v) __Retiree representative__ 

                    (I) __In general__ 

                        In the case of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days prior to the plan sponsor submitting an application to suspend benefits, the plan sponsor shall select a participant of the plan in pay status to act as a retiree representative. The retiree representative shall advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and beneficiaries of the plan throughout the suspension approval process.

                    (II) __Reasonable expenses from plan__ 

                        The plan shall provide for reasonable expenses by the retiree representative, including reasonable legal and actuarial support, commensurate with the plan’s size and funded status.

                    (III) __Special rule relating to fiduciary status__ 

                        Duties performed pursuant to subclause (I) shall not be subject to [section 1104(a) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1104/a]. The preceding sentence shall not apply to those duties associated with an application to suspend benefits pursuant to subparagraph (G) that are performed by the retiree representative who is also a plan trustee.

            (C) __Conditions for suspensions__ 

            The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year may suspend benefits only if the following conditions are met:

                (i) Taking into account the proposed suspensions of benefits (and, if applicable, a proposed partition of the plan under [section 1413 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1413]), the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426], assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until the suspensions of benefits expire by their own terms or if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely.

                (ii)

                 The plan sponsor determines, in a written record to be maintained throughout the period of the benefit suspension, that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended under this paragraph, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension). In its determination, the plan sponsor may take into account factors including the following:

                    (I) Current and past contribution levels.

                    (II) Levels of benefit accruals (including any prior reductions in the rate of benefit accruals).

                    (III) Prior reductions (if any) of adjustable benefits.

                    (IV) Prior suspensions (if any) of benefits under this subsection.

                    (V) The impact on plan solvency of the subsidies and ancillary benefits available to active participants.

                    (VI) Compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants’ industry generally.

                    (VII) Competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers.

                    (VIII) The impact of benefit and contribution levels on retaining active participants and bargaining groups under the plan.

                    (IX) The impact of past and anticipated contribution increases under the plan on employer attrition and retention levels.

                    (X) Measures undertaken by the plan sponsor to retain or attract contributing employers.

            (D) __Limitations on suspensions__ 

            Any suspensions of benefits made by a plan sponsor pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following limitations:

                (i) The monthly benefit of any participant or beneficiary may not be reduced below 110 percent of the monthly benefit which is guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under [section 1322a of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322a] on the date of the suspension.

                (ii)

                    (I) In the case of a participant or beneficiary who has attained 75 years of age as of the effective date of the suspension, not more than the applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits of such participant or beneficiary may be suspended under this paragraph.

                    (II) For purposes of subclause (I), the maximum suspendable benefits of a participant or beneficiary is the portion of the benefits of such participant or beneficiary that would be suspended pursuant to this paragraph without regard to this clause;

                    (III)

                     For purposes of subclause (I), the applicable percentage is a percentage equal to the quotient obtained by dividing—

                        (aa) the number of months during the period beginning with the month after the month in which occurs the effective date of the suspension and ending with the month during which the participant or beneficiary attains the age of 80, by

                        (bb) 60 months.

                (iii) No benefits based on disability (as defined under the plan) may be suspended under this paragraph.

                (iv) Any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate (and, if applicable, considered in combination with a partition of the plan under [section 1413 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1413]), shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level that is necessary to avoid insolvency.

                (v) In any case in which a suspension of benefits with respect to a plan is made in combination with a partition of the plan under [section 1413 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1413], the suspension of benefits may not take effect prior to the effective date of such partition.

                (vi)

                 Any suspensions of benefits shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account factors, with respect to participants and beneficiaries and their benefits, that may include one or more of the following:

                    (I) Age and life expectancy.

                    (II) Length of time in pay status.

                    (III) Amount of benefit.

                    (IV) Type of benefit: survivor, normal retirement, early retirement.

                    (V) Extent to which participant or beneficiary is receiving a subsidized benefit.

                    (VI) Extent to which participant or beneficiary has received post-retirement benefit increases.

                    (VII) History of benefit increases and reductions.

                    (VIII) Years to retirement for active employees.

                    (IX) Any discrepancies between active and retiree benefits.

                    (X) Extent to which active participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan, accelerating employer withdrawals from the plan and increasing the risk of additional benefit reductions for participants in and out of pay status.

                    (XI) Extent to which benefits are attributed to service with an employer that failed to pay its full withdrawal liability.

                (vii)

                 In the case of a plan that includes the benefits described in clause (III), benefits suspended under this paragraph shall—

                    (I) first, be applied to the maximum extent permissible to benefits attributable to a participant’s service for an employer which withdrew from the plan and failed to pay (or is delinquent with respect to paying) the full amount of its withdrawal liability under [section 1381(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1381/b/1] or an agreement with the plan,

                    (II) second, except as provided by subclause (III), be applied to all other benefits that may be suspended under this paragraph, and

                    (III)

                     third, be applied to benefits under a plan that are directly attributable to a participant’s service with any employer which has, prior to December 16, 2014—

                        (aa) withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal under [section 1383 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1383] and has paid the full amount of the employer’s withdrawal liability under section 1381(b)(1) of title or an agreement with the plan, and

                        (bb) pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, assumed liability for providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the plan under a separate, single-employer plan sponsored by the employer, in an amount equal to any amount of benefits for such participants and beneficiaries reduced as a result of the financial status of the plan.

            (E) __Benefit improvements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The plan sponsor may, in its sole discretion, provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits under the plan remains in effect, except that the plan sponsor may not increase the liabilities of the plan by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless—

                    (I) such action is accompanied by equitable benefit improvements in accordance with clause (ii) for all participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement dates were before the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement for such participant or beneficiary not in pay status took effect; and

                    (II) the plan actuary certifies that after taking into account such benefits improvements the plan is projected to avoid insolvency indefinitely under [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426].

                (ii) __Equitable distribution of benefit improvements__ 

                    (I) __Limitation__ 

                        The projected value of the total liabilities for benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, as determined as of such date, may not exceed the projected value of the liabilities arising from benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries with benefit commencement dates prior to the first day of such plan year, as so determined.

                    (II) __Equitable distribution of benefits__ 

                        The plan sponsor shall equitably distribute any increase in total liabilities for benefit improvements in clause (i) to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is before the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi) and the extent to which the benefits of the participants and beneficiaries were suspended.

                (iii) __Special rule for resumptions of benefits only for participants in pay status__ 

                    The plan sponsor may increase liabilities of the plan through a resumption of benefits for participants and beneficiaries in pay status only if the plan sponsor equitably distributes the value of resumed benefits to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries in pay status, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi).

                (iv) __Special rule for certain benefit increases__ 

                This subparagraph shall not apply to a resumption of suspended benefits or plan amendment which increases liabilities with respect to participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements took effect which—

                    (I) the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan, or

                    (II) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of subtitle A of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

                (v) __Additional limitations__ 

                    Except for resumptions of suspended benefits described in clause (iii), the limitations on benefit improvements while a suspension of benefits is in effect under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other applicable limitations on increases in benefits imposed on a plan.

                (vi) __Definition of benefit improvement__ 

                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “benefit improvement” means, with respect to a plan, a resumption of suspended benefits, an increase in benefits, an increase in the rate at which benefits accrue, or an increase in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan.

            (F) __Notice requirements__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                No suspension of benefits may be made pursuant to this paragraph unless notice of such proposed suspension has been given by the plan sponsor concurrently with an application for approval of such suspension submitted under subparagraph (G) to the Secretary of the Treasury to—
