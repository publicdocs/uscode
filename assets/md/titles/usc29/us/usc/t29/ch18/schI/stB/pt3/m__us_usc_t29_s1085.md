## § 1085. Additional funding rules for multiemployer plans in endangered status or critical status

    (a) __General rule__ 

    For purposes of this part, in the case of a multiemployer plan in effect on July 16, 2006—

        (1)

         if the plan is in endangered status—

            (A) the plan sponsor shall adopt and implement a funding improvement plan in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c), and

            (B) the requirements of subsection (d) shall apply during the funding plan adoption period and the funding improvement period, and

        (2)

         if the plan is in critical status—

            (A) the plan sponsor shall adopt and implement a rehabilitation plan in accordance with the requirements of subsection (e), and

            (B) the requirements of subsection (f) shall apply during the rehabilitation plan adoption period and the rehabilitation period.

    (b) __Determination of endangered and critical status__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Endangered status__ 

        A multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year if, as determined by the plan actuary under paragraph (3), the plan is not in critical status for the plan year and, as of the beginning of the plan year, either—

            (A) the plan’s funded percentage for such plan year is less than 80 percent, or

            (B) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for such plan year, or is projected to have such an accumulated funding deficiency for any of the 6 succeeding plan years, taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            For purposes of this section, a plan shall be treated as in seriously endangered status for a plan year if the plan is described in both subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2) __Critical status__ 

        A multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year if, as determined by the plan actuary under paragraph (3), the plan is described in 1 or more of the following subparagraphs as of the beginning of the plan year:

            (A)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i) the funded percentage of the plan is less than 65 percent, and

                (ii)

                 the sum of—

                    (I) the fair market value of plan assets, plus

                    (II) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of all collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years,

                 is less than the present value of all nonforfeitable benefits projected to be payable under the plan during the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years (plus administrative expenses for such plan years).

            (B)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for the current plan year, not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d], or

                (ii) the plan is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for any of the 3 succeeding plan years (4 succeeding plan years if the funded percentage of the plan is 65 percent or less), not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            (C)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if—

                (i)

                    (I) the plan’s normal cost for the current plan year, plus interest (determined at the rate used for determining costs under the plan) for the current plan year on the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan as of the last date of the preceding plan year, exceeds

                    (II) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer and employee contributions for the current plan year,

                (ii) the present value, as of the beginning of the current plan year, of nonforfeitable benefits of inactive participants is greater than the present value of nonforfeitable benefits of active participants, and

                (iii) the plan has an accumulated funding deficiency for the current plan year, or is projected to have such a deficiency for any of the 4 succeeding plan years, not taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

            (D)

             A plan is described in this subparagraph if the sum of—

                (i) the fair market value of plan assets, plus

                (ii) the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current plan year and each of the 4 succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of all collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years,

                is less than the present value of all benefits projected to be payable under the plan during the current plan year and each of the 4 succeeding plan years (plus administrative expenses for such plan years).

        (3) __Annual certification by plan actuary__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            Not later than the 90th day of each plan year of a multiemployer plan, the plan actuary shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the plan sponsor—

                (i) whether or not the plan is in endangered status for such plan year and whether or not the plan is or will be in critical status for such plan year, and

                (ii) in the case of a plan which is in a funding improvement or rehabilitation period, whether or not the plan is making the scheduled progress in meeting the requirements of its funding improvement or rehabilitation plan.

            (B) __Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                In making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary’s projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either—

                    (I) the actuarial statement required under [section 1023(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1023/d] with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or

                    (II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.

                (ii) __Determinations of future contributions__ 

                Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume—

                    (I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or

                    (II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.

                (iii) __Projected industry activity__ 

                    Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.

            (C) __Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification__ 

                Any failure of the plan’s actuary to certify the plan’s status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of [section 1132(c)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1132/c/2] as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under [section 1021(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1021/b/1].

            (D) __Notice__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                    In any case in which it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in endangered or critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the endangered or critical status to the participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Secretary.

                (ii) __Plans in critical status__ 

                If it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in critical status, the plan sponsor shall include in the notice under clause (i) an explanation of the possibility that—

                    (I) adjustable benefits (as defined in subsection (e)(8)) may be reduced, and

                    (II) such reductions may apply to participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is on or after the date such notice is provided for the first plan year in which the plan is in critical status.

                (iii) __Model notice__ 

                    The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma. </sup></sup>  shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clause (ii).

    (c) __Funding improvement plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—

            (A) shall adopt a funding improvement plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certification of endangered status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and

            (B)

             within 30 days after the adoption of the funding improvement plan—

                (i)

                 shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan, including—

                    (I) one proposal for reductions in the amount of future benefit accruals necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments increasing contributions under the plan (other than amendments increasing contributions necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks after amendments have reduced future benefit accruals to the maximum extent permitted by law), and

                    (II) one proposal for increases in contributions under the plan necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments reducing future benefit accruals under the plan, and

                (ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to achieving the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan.

                For purposes of this section, the term “applicable benchmarks” means the requirements applicable to the multiemployer plan under paragraph (3) (as modified by paragraph (5)).

        (2) __Exception for years after process begins__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period by reason of the plan being in endangered status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial determination year with respect to the funding improvement plan to which it relates.

        (3) __Funding improvement plan__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            A funding improvement plan is a plan which consists of the actions, including options or a range of options to be proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated to provide, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, for the attainment by the plan during the funding improvement period of the following requirements:

                (i) __Increase in plan’s funding percentage__ 

                The plan’s funded percentage as of the close of the funding improvement period equals or exceeds a percentage equal to the sum of—

                    (I) such percentage as of the beginning of such period, plus

                (ii) __Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiencies__ 

                    No accumulated funding deficiency for any plan year during the funding improvement period (taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d]).

            (B) __Seriously endangered plans__ 

                In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall be applied by substituting “20 percent” for “33 percent”.

        (4) __Funding improvement period__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The funding improvement period for any funding improvement plan adopted pursuant to this subsection is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan beginning after the earlier of—

                (i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the funding improvement plan, or

                (ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of endangered status for the initial determination year under subsection (b)(3)(A) and covering, as of such due date, at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.

            (B) __Seriously endangered plans__ 

                In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “15-year period” for “10-year period”.

            (C) __Coordination with changes in status__ 

                (i) __Plans no longer in endangered status__ 

                    If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is no longer in endangered status and is not in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the preceding plan year.

                (ii) __Plans in critical status__ 

                    If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the plan year preceding the first plan year in the rehabilitation period with respect to such status.

            (D) __Plans in endangered status at end of period__ 

                If the plan’s actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the first plan year following the close of the period described in subparagraph (A) that the plan is in endangered status, the provisions of this subsection and subsection (d) shall be applied as if such first plan year were an initial determination year, except that the plan may not be amended in a manner inconsistent with the funding improvement plan in effect for the preceding plan year until a new funding improvement plan is adopted.

        (5) __Special rules for seriously endangered plans more than 70 percent funded__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            If the funded percentage of a plan in seriously endangered status was more than 70 percent as of the beginning of the initial determination year—

                (i) paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall apply only if the plan’s actuary certifies, within 30 days after the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year, that, based on the terms of the plan and the collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of such certification, the plan is not projected to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), and

                (ii) if there is a certification under clause (i), the plan may, in formulating its funding improvement plan, only take into account the rules of paragraph (3)(B) and (4)(B) for plan years in the funding improvement period beginning on or before the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreements described in paragraph (4)(A)(ii) expires.

            (B) __Special rule after expiration of agreements__ 

                Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(ii), if, for any plan year ending after the date described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the plan actuary certifies (at the time of the annual certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for such plan year) that, based on the terms of the plan and collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of that annual certification, the plan is not projected to be able to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall continue to apply for such year.

        (6) __Updates to funding improvement plan and schedules__ 

            (A) __Funding improvement plan__

            (A) __In general__ 

            If—

                (i) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered endangered status expires, and

                (ii) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,

                the plan sponsor shall implement the schedule described in paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I) beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (B).

            (B) __Date of implementation__ 

                The date specified in this subparagraph is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in subparagraph (A) expires.

            (C) __Failure to make scheduled contributions__ 

                Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this paragraph shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [section 1145 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1145] and shall be enforceable as such.

        (8) __Funding plan adoption period__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “funding plan adoption period” means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year and ending on the day before the first day of the funding improvement period.

        (1) __Special rules for plan adoption period__ 

        During the funding plan adoption period—

            (A)

                (i) a reduction in the level of contributions for any participants,

                (ii) a suspension of contributions with respect to any period of service, or

                (iii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation,

            (B) no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan may be adopted unless the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law, and

            (C)

             in the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, the plan sponsor shall take all reasonable actions which are consistent with the terms of the plan and applicable law and which are expected, based on reasonable assumptions, to achieve—

                (i) an increase in the plan’s funded percentage, and

                (ii) postponement of an accumulated funding deficiency for at least 1 additional plan year.

            Actions under subparagraph (C) include applications for extensions of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d], use of the shortfall funding method in making funding standard account computations, amendments to the plan’s benefit structure, reductions in future benefit accruals, and other reasonable actions consistent with the terms of the plan and applicable law.

        (2) __Compliance with funding improvement plan__

            (C) __Special rules for benefit increases__ 

                A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan so as to increase benefits, including future benefit accruals, unless the plan actuary certifies that the benefit increase is consistent with the funding improvement plan and is paid for out of contributions not required by the funding improvement plan to meet the applicable benchmark in accordance with the schedule contemplated in the funding improvement plan.

    (e) __Rehabilitation plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—

            (A) shall adopt a rehabilitation plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certification of critical status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and

            (B)

             within 30 days after the adoption of the rehabilitation plan—

                (i) shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan, and

                (ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to emerging from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.

            The schedule or schedules described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall reflect reductions in future benefit accruals and adjustable benefits, and increases in contributions, that the plan sponsor determines are reasonably necessary to emerge from critical status. One schedule shall be designated as the default schedule and such schedule shall assume that there are no increases in contributions under the plan other than the increases necessary to emerge from critical status after future benefit accruals and other benefits (other than benefits the reduction or elimination of which are not permitted under [section 1054(g) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1054/g]) have been reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

        (2) __Exception for years after process begins__ 

            Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a rehabilitation plan adoption period or rehabilitation period by reason of the plan being in critical status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial critical year with respect to the rehabilitation plan to which it relates.

        (3) __Rehabilitation plan__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            A rehabilitation plan is a plan which consists of—

                (ii) if the plan sponsor determines that, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions and upon exhaustion of all reasonable measures, the plan can not reasonably be expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, reasonable measures to emerge from critical status at a later time or to forestall possible insolvency (within the meaning of [section 1426 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1426]).

                A rehabilitation plan must provide annual standards for meeting the requirements of such rehabilitation plan. Such plan shall also include the schedules required to be provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i) and if clause (ii) applies, shall set forth the alternatives considered, explain why the plan is not reasonably expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, and specify when, if ever, the plan is expected to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.

            (B) __Updates to rehabilitation plan and schedules__ 

                (i) __Rehabilitation plan__ 

                    The plan sponsor shall annually update the rehabilitation plan and shall file the update with the plan’s annual report under [section 1024 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1024].

            (C) __Imposition of default schedule where failure to adopt rehabilitation plan__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                If—

                    (I) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered critical status expires, and

                    (II) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a to adopt a  <sup>\[2\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 2 So in original. See 2008 Amendment note below. </sup></sup>  contribution schedule with terms consistent with the rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i),

                 the plan sponsor shall implement the default schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) beginning on the date specified in clause (ii).

                (ii) __Date of implementation__ 

                    The date specified in this clause is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in clause (i) expires.

                (iii) __Failure to make scheduled contributions__ 

                    Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [section 1145 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1145] and shall be enforceable as such.

        (4) __Rehabilitation period__ 

        For purposes of this section—

            (A) __In general__ 

            The rehabilitation period for a plan in critical status is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan following the earlier of—

                (i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the rehabilitation plan, or

                (ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of critical status for the initial critical year under subsection (a)(1) and covering, as of such date at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.

                If a plan emerges from critical status as provided under subparagraph (B) before the end of such 10-year period, the rehabilitation period shall end with the plan year preceding the plan year for which the determination under subparagraph (B) is made.

            (B) __Emergence__ 

                A plan in critical status shall remain in such status until a plan year for which the plan actuary certifies, in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), that the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under [section 1084(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1084/d].

        (5) __Rehabilitation plan adoption period__ 

            For purposes of this section, the term “rehabilitation plan adoption period” means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial critical year and ending on the day before the first day of the rehabilitation period.

            (B) if lower, the accrual rate under the plan on such first day.

            The equivalent standard accrual rate shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representative for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise described in this paragraph.

                    (III) benefit increases that would not be eligible for a guarantee under [section 1322a of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322a] on the first day of initial critical year because the increases were adopted (or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months before such first day.
