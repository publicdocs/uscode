## § 1413. Partition

    (a) __Authority of corporation__ 

        The corporation may order the partition of a multiemployer plan in accordance with this section.

    (b) __Authority of plan sponsor upon application to corporation for partition order; procedures applicable to corporation__ 

    A plan sponsor may apply to the corporation for an order partitioning a plan. The corporation may not order the partition of a plan except upon notice to the plan sponsor and the participants and beneficiaries whose vested benefits will be affected by the partition of the plan, and upon finding that—

        (1) a substantial reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions under the plan has resulted or will result from a case or proceeding under title 11 with respect to an employer;

        (2) the plan is likely to become insolvent;

        (3) contributions will have to be increased significantly in reorganization to meet the minimum contribution requirement and prevent insolvency; and

        (4) partition would significantly reduce the likelihood that the plan will become insolvent.

    (c) __Authority of corporation notwithstanding pendency of partition proceeding__ 

        The corporation may order the partition of a plan notwithstanding the pendency of a proceeding described in subsection (b)(1) of this section.

    (d) __Scope of partition order__ 

        The corporation’s partition order shall provide for a transfer of no more than the nonforfeitable benefits directly attributable to service with the employer referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section and an equitable share of assets.

    (e) __Nature of plan created by partition__ 

    The plan created by the partition is—

        (1) a successor plan to which [section 1322a of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322a] applies, and

        (2) a terminated multiemployer plan to which [section 1341a(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341a/d] applies, with respect to which only the employer described in subsection (b)(1) of this section has withdrawal liability, and to which [section 1368 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1368] applies.

    (f) __Authority of corporation to obtain decree partitioning plan and appointing trustee for terminated portion of partitioned plan__ 

        The corporation may proceed under section 1342(c) through (h) of this title for a decree partitioning a plan and appointing a trustee for the terminated portion of a partitioned plan. The court may order the partition of a plan upon making the findings described in subsection (b)(1) through (4) of this section, and subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (c) through (e) of this section.
