## § 1303. Operation of corporation

    (a) __Investigatory authority; audit of statistically significant number of terminating plans__ 

        The corporation may make such investigations as it deems necessary to enforce any provision of this subchapter or any rule or regulation thereunder, and may require or permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the corporation shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. The corporation shall annually audit a statistically significant number of plans terminating under [section 1341(b) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1341/b] to determine whether participants and beneficiaries have received their benefit commitments and whether [section 1350(a) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1350/a] has been satisfied. Each audit shall include a statistically significant number of participants and beneficiaries.

    (b) __Discovery powers vested in board members or officers designated by the chairman__ 

        For the purpose of any such investigation, or any other proceeding under this subchapter, the Director, any member of the board of directors of the corporation, or any officer designated by the Director or chairman, may administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, or other records which the corporation deems relevant or material to the inquiry.

    (c) __Contempt__ 

        In the case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the corporation may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records. The court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the corporation, or member or officer designated by the corporation, and to produce records or to give testimony related to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district in which such person is an inhabitant or may be found.

    (d) __Cooperation with other governmental agencies__ 

        In order to avoid unnecessary expense and duplication of functions among government agencies, the corporation may make such arrangements or agreements for cooperation or mutual assistance in the performance of its functions under this subchapter as is practicable and consistent with law. The corporation may utilize the facilities or services of any department, agency, or establishment of the United States or of any State or political subdivision of a State, including the services of any of its employees, with the lawful consent of such department, agency, or establishment. The head of each department, agency, or establishment of the United States shall cooperate with the corporation and, to the extent permitted by law, provide such information and facilities as it may request for its assistance in the performance of its functions under this subchapter. The Attorney General or his representative shall receive from the corporation for appropriate action such evidence developed in the performance of its functions under this subchapter as may be found to warrant consideration for criminal prosecution under the provisions of this or any other Federal law.
