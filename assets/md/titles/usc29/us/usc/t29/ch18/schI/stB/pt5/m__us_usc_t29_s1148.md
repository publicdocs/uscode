## § 1148. Authority to postpone certain deadlines by reason of Presidentially declared disaster or terroristic or military actions

    In the case of a pension or other employee benefit plan, or any sponsor, administrator, participant, beneficiary, or other person with respect to such plan, affected by a Presidentially declared disaster (as defined in [section 1033(h)(3) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s1033/h/3]) or a terroristic or military action (as defined in section 692(c)(2) of such title), the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, prescribe, by notice or otherwise, a period of up to 1 year which may be disregarded in determining the date by which any action is required or permitted to be completed under this chapter. No plan shall be treated as failing to be operated in accordance with the terms of the plan solely as the result of disregarding any period by reason of the preceding sentence.
