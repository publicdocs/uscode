## § 1341. Termination of single-employer plans

    (a) __General rules governing single-employer plan terminations__ 

        (1) __Exclusive means of plan termination__ 

            Except in the case of a termination for which proceedings are otherwise instituted by the corporation as provided in [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342], a single-employer plan may be terminated only in a standard termination under subsection (b) or a distress termination under subsection (c).

        (2) __60-day notice of intent to terminate__ 

            Not less than 60 days before the proposed termination date of a standard termination under subsection (b) or a distress termination under subsection (c), the plan administrator shall provide to each affected party (other than the corporation in the case of a standard termination) a written notice of intent to terminate stating that such termination is intended and the proposed termination date. The written notice shall include any related additional information required in regulations of the corporation.

        (3) __Adherence to collective bargaining agreements__ 

            The corporation shall not proceed with a termination of a plan under this section if the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the authority of the corporation to institute proceedings to involuntarily terminate a plan under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342].

    (b) __Standard termination of single-employer plans__ 

        (1) __General requirements__ 

        A single-employer plan may terminate under a standard termination only if—

            (A) the plan administrator provides the 60-day advance notice of intent to terminate to affected parties required under subsection (a)(2),

            (B) the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) are met,

            (C) the corporation does not issue a notice of noncompliance under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2), and

            (D) when the final distribution of assets occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).

        (2) __Termination procedure__ 

            (A) __Notice to the corporation__ 

            As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation setting forth—

                (i)

                 certification by an enrolled actuary—

                    (I) of the projected amount of the assets of the plan (as of a proposed date of final distribution of assets),

                    (II) of the actuarial present value (as of such date) of the benefit liabilities (determined as of the proposed termination date) under the plan, and

                    (III) that the plan is projected to be sufficient (as of such proposed date of final distribution) for such benefit liabilities,

                (ii) such information as the corporation may prescribe in regulations as necessary to enable the corporation to make determinations under subparagraph (C), and

                (iii)

                 certification by the plan administrator that—

                    (I) the information on which the enrolled actuary based the certification under clause (i) is accurate and complete, and

                    (II) the information provided to the corporation under clause (ii) is accurate and complete.

                Clause (i) and clause (iii)(I) shall not apply to a plan described in section 412(i)  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 26.

            (B) __Notice to participants and beneficiaries of benefit commitments__  __ <sup>\[__  __2__  __\]</sup> __  __ <sup><sup> __  __2__  __ So in original. Probably should be “benefit liabilities”.__  __ </sup></sup> __ 

            No later than the date on which a notice is sent by the plan administrator under subparagraph (A), the plan administrator shall send a notice to each person who is a participant or beneficiary under the plan—

                (i) specifying the amount of the benefit liabilities (if any) attributable to such person as of the proposed termination date and the benefit form on the basis of which such amount is determined, and

                (ii)

                 including the following information used in determining such benefit liabilities:

                    (I) the length of service,

                    (II) the age of the participant or beneficiary,

                    (III) wages,

                    (IV) the assumptions, including the interest rate, and

                    (V) such other information as the corporation may require.

                Such notice shall be written in such manner as is likely to be understood by the participant or beneficiary and as may be prescribed in regulations of the corporation.

            (C) __Notice from the corporation of noncompliance__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                Within 60 days after receipt of the notice under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall issue a notice of noncompliance to the plan administrator if—

                    (I) it determines, based on the notice sent under paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b), that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities,

                    (II) it otherwise determines, on the basis of information provided by affected parties or otherwise obtained by the corporation, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities, or

                    (III) it determines that any other requirement of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph or of subsection (a)(2) has not been met, unless it further determines that the issuance of such notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.

                (ii) __Extension__ 

                    The corporation and the plan administrator may agree to extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) by a written agreement signed by the corporation and the plan administrator before the expiration of the 60-day period. The 60-day period shall be extended as provided in the agreement and may be further extended by subsequent written agreements signed by the corporation and the plan administrator made before the expiration of a previously agreed upon extension of the 60-day period. Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.

            (D) __Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance__ 

            The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if—

                (i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and

                (ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).

        (3) __Methods of final distribution of assets__ 

            (A) __In general__ 

            In connection with any final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall distribute the assets in accordance with [section 1344 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1344]. In distributing such assets, the plan administrator shall—

                (i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or

                (ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan. A transfer of assets to the corporation in accordance with [section 1350 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1350] on behalf of a missing participant shall satisfy this subparagraph with respect to such participant.

            (B) __Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets__ 

                Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.

        (4) __Continuing authority__ 

            Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the continued exercise by the corporation, after the termination date of a plan terminated in a standard termination under this subsection, of its authority under [section 1303 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1303] with respect to matters relating to the termination. A certification under paragraph (3)(B) shall not affect the corporation’s obligations under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322].

        (5) __Special rule for certain plans where cessation or change in membership of a controlled group__ 

            (A) __In general__

                (i) there is  <sup>\[3\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 3 So in original. The word “a” probably should appear. </sup></sup>  transaction or series of transactions which result in a person ceasing to be a member of a controlled group, and

                (ii) such person immediately before the transaction or series of transactions maintained a single-employer plan which is a defined benefit plan which is fully funded,

                then the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities or to otherwise assess plan liabilities for purposes of this subsection or [section 1342(a)(4) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342/a/4] shall be not less than the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is fully funded.

            (B) __Limitations__ 

            Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions unless—

                (i)

                 any employer maintaining the plan immediately before or after such transaction or series of transactions—

                    (I) has an outstanding senior unsecured debt instrument which is rated investment grade by each of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for corporate bonds that has issued a credit rating for such instrument, or

                    (II) if no such debt instrument of such employer has been rated by such an organization but 1 or more of such organizations has made an issuer credit rating for such employer, all such organizations which have so rated the employer have rated such employer investment grade, and

                (ii) the employer maintaining the plan after the transaction or series of transactions employs at least 20 percent of the employees located in the United States who were employed by such employer immediately before the transaction or series of transactions.

            (C) __Fully funded__ 

            For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan shall be treated as fully funded with respect to any transaction or series of transactions if—

                (i) in the case of a transaction or series of transactions which occur in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2008, the funded current liability percentage determined under [section 1082(d) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1082/d] for the plan year is at least 100 percent, and

                (ii) in the case of a transaction or series of transactions which occur in a plan year beginning on or after such date, the funding target attainment percentage determined under [section 1083 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1083] is, as of the valuation date for such plan year, at least 100 percent.

            (D) __2 year limitation__ 

                Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions if the plan referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) is terminated under subsection (c) or [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342] after the close of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the first such transaction occurs.

    (c) __Distress termination of single-employer plans__ 

        (1) __In general__

            Upon receipt of the notice of intent to terminate required under subsection (a)(2) and the information required under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall determine whether the requirements of this subparagraph are met as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii). The requirements of this subparagraph are met if each person who is (as of the proposed termination date) a contributing sponsor of such plan or a member of such sponsor’s controlled group meets the requirements of any of the following clauses:

                (i) __Liquidation in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings__ 

                The requirements of this clause are met by a person if—

                    (I) such person has filed or has had filed against such person, as of the proposed termination date, a petition seeking liquidation in a case under title 11 or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision of a State (or a case described in clause (ii) filed by or against such person has been converted, as of such date, to a case in which liquidation is sought), and

                    (II) such case has not, as of the proposed termination date, been dismissed.

                    (II) the costs of providing pension coverage have become unreasonably burdensome to such person, solely as a result of a decline of such person’s workforce covered as participants under all single-employer plans of which such person is a contributing sponsor.

            (C) __Notification of determinations by the corporation__ 

                The corporation shall notify the plan administrator as soon as practicable of its determinations made pursuant to subparagraph (B).

                    (II) __Limitation__ 

                        A court may limit disclosure under this subparagraph of confidential information described in [section 552(b) of title 5][/us/usc/t5/s552/b] to any authorized representative of the participants or beneficiaries that agrees to ensure the confidentiality of such information.

        (3) __Termination procedure__ 

            (A) __Determinations by the corporation relating to plan sufficiency for guaranteed benefits and for benefit liabilities__ 

            If the corporation determines that the requirements for a distress termination set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) are met, the corporation shall—

                (i) determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation,

                (ii) determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation, and

                (iii) notify the plan administrator of the determinations made pursuant to this subparagraph as soon as practicable.

            (B) __Implementation of termination__ 

            After the corporation notifies the plan administrator of its determinations under subparagraph (A), the termination of the plan shall be carried out as soon as practicable, as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii).

                (i) __Cases of sufficiency for benefit liabilities__ 

                    In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan’s assets, and make certification to the corporation with respect to such distribution, in the manner described in subsection (b)(3), and shall take such other actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.

                (ii) __Cases of sufficiency for guaranteed benefits without a finding of sufficiency for benefit liabilities__ 

                    In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan’s assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3), make certification to the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.

                (iii) __Cases without any finding of sufficiency__ 

                    In any case in which the corporation determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits on the basis of the information made available to it, the corporation shall commence proceedings in accordance with [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342].

            (C) __Finding after authorized commencement of termination that plan is unable to pay benefits__ 

                (i) __Finding with respect to benefit liabilities which are not guaranteed benefits__ 

                    If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized under subparagraph (B)(i), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay benefit liabilities which are not benefits guaranteed by the corporation under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322], the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.

                (ii) __Finding with respect to guaranteed benefits__ 

                    If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized by subparagraph (B)(i) or (ii), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay all benefits under the plan which are guaranteed by the corporation under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322], the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter. If the corporation concurs in the finding of the plan administrator (or the corporation itself makes such a finding), the corporation shall institute appropriate proceedings under [section 1342 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1342].

            (D) __Administration of the plan during interim period__ 

                (i) __In general__ 

                The plan administrator shall—

                    (I) meet the requirements of clause (ii) for the period commencing on the date on which the plan administrator provides a notice of distress termination to the corporation under subsection (a)(2) and ending on the date on which the plan administrator receives notification from the corporation of its determinations under subparagraph (A), and

                    (II) meet the requirements of clause (ii) commencing on the date on which the plan administrator or the corporation makes a finding under subparagraph (C)(ii).

                (ii) __Requirements__ 

                The requirements of this clause are met by the plan administrator if the plan administrator—

                    (I) refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,

                    (II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,

                    (III) does not use plan assets to purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and

                    (IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guaranteed by the corporation under [section 1322 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1322] or to which assets are required to be allocated under [section 1344 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1344].

                 In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compliance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable immediately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in accordance with regulations of the corporation).

    (d) __Sufficiency__ 

    For purposes of this section—

        (1) __Sufficiency for benefit liabilities__ 

            A single-employer plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities if there is no amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan.

        (2) __Sufficiency for guaranteed benefits__ 

            A single-employer plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits if there is no amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits under the plan.

    (e) __Limitation on the conversion of a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan__ 

        The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in [section 1321(b)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1321/b/1] constitutes a termination of the plan. Such an amendment may take effect only after the plan satisfies the requirements for standard termination under subsection (b) or distress termination under subsection (c).
