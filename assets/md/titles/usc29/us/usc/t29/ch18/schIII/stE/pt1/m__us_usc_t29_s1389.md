        reduced by the amount, if any, by which the unfunded vested benefits allowable to the employer, determined without regard to this subsection, exceeds $100,000.

    (b) __Amendment of plan for reduction of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan__ 

    A plan may be amended to provide for the reduction of the amount determined under [section 1391 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s1391] by not more than the greater of—

        (2)

         the lesser of—

            (A) the amount determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section, or

    (c) __Nonapplicability__ 

    This section does not apply—

        (1) to an employer who withdraws in a plan year in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan, or

        (2) in any case in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan during a period of one or more plan years pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw, to an employer who withdraws pursuant to such agreement or arrangement.

    (d) __Presumption of employer withdrawal from plan pursuant to agreement or arrangement applicable in action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability__ 

        In any action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability, if substantially all employers have withdrawn from a plan within a period of 3 plan years, an employer who has withdrawn from such plan during such period shall be presumed to have withdrawn from the plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
