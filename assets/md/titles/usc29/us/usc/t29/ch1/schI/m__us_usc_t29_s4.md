## § 4. Duties of Commissioner in general

    It shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Labor Statistics to ascertain the effect of the customs laws, and the effect thereon of the state of the currency, in the United States, on the agricultural industry, especially as to its effect on mortgage indebtedness of farmers. He shall also establish a system of reports by which, at intervals of not less than two years, he can report the general condition, so far as production is concerned, of the leading industries of the country. He is also specially charged to investigate the causes of, and facts relating to, all controversies and disputes between employers and employees as they may occur, and which may tend to interfere with the welfare of the people of the different States. He shall also obtain such information upon the various subjects committed to him as he may deem desirable from different foreign nations, and what, if any, convict-made goods are imported into this country, and if so from whence.

 __Codification__ 

    Section is from act June 13, 1888. Act June 13, 1888, also contained other provisions relating to duties of former Commissioner of Labor to ascertain cost of producing, in leading countries, articles dutiable in United States, comparative cost of living, etc., which have been omitted from this section because of act Aug. 23, 1912, transferring those duties to Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce.

    Act Aug. 23, 1912, transferred the duty of former Commissioner of Labor to ascertain the cost of producing, in leading countries, articles dutiable in the United States, the profits of the manufacturers and producers of such articles, the comparative cost of such articles, comparative cost of living in such countries, what articles are controlled by trusts and the effect they have on prices and production, to the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. Text of said act is set out as [section 172 of Title 15][/us/usc/t15/s172], Commerce and Trade.

    Act Mar. 4, 1913, authorized the substitution of “Commissioner of Labor Statistics” for “Commissioner of Labor”.

 __Amendments__ 

    1928—Act May 29, 1928, repealed provisions requiring reports to Congress on investigations required by this section, and is authority for omission of “and report as to” after “ascertain” in first sentence and “and report thereon to Congress” at end of third sentence relating to information from foreign nations, and convict made goods.

 __Transfer of Functions__ 

    For transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of Department of Labor, with certain exceptions, to Secretary of Labor, with power to delegate, see Reorg. Plan No. 6 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, 15 F.R. 3174, [64 Stat. 1263][/us/stat/64/1263], set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
