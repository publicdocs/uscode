## § 2614. Employment and benefits protection

    (a) __Restoration to position__ 

        (1) __In general__ 

        Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any eligible employee who takes leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612] for the intended purpose of the leave shall be entitled, on return from such leave—

            (A) to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced; or

            (B) to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.

        (2) __Loss of benefits__ 

            The taking of leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612] shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.

        (3) __Limitations__ 

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to—

            (A) the accrual of any seniority or employment benefits during any period of leave; or

            (B) any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.

        (4) __Certification__ 

            As a condition of restoration under paragraph (1) for an employee who has taken leave under [section 2612(a)(1)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/1/D], the employer may have a uniformly applied practice or policy that requires each such employee to receive certification from the health care provider of the employee that the employee is able to resume work, except that nothing in this paragraph shall supersede a valid State or local law or a collective bargaining agreement that governs the return to work of such employees.

        (5) __Construction__ 

            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an employer from requiring an employee on leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612] to report periodically to the employer on the status and intention of the employee to return to work.

    (b) __Exemption concerning certain highly compensated employees__ 

        (1) __Denial of restoration__ 

        An employer may deny restoration under subsection (a) of this section to any eligible employee described in paragraph (2) if—

            (A) such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer;

            (B) the employer notifies the employee of the intent of the employer to deny restoration on such basis at the time the employer determines that such injury would occur; and

            (C) in any case in which the leave has commenced, the employee elects not to return to employment after receiving such notice.

        (2) __Affected employees__ 

            An eligible employee described in paragraph (1) is a salaried eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the facility at which the employee is employed.

    (c) __Maintenance of health benefits__ 

        (1) __Coverage__ 

            Except as provided in paragraph (2), during any period that an eligible employee takes leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612], the employer shall maintain coverage under any “group health plan” (as defined in [section 5000(b)(1) of title 26][/us/usc/t26/s5000/b/1]) for the duration of such leave at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment continuously for the duration of such leave.

        (2) __Failure to return from leave__ 

        The employer may recover the premium that the employer paid for maintaining coverage for the employee under such group health plan during any period of unpaid leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612] if—

            (A) the employee fails to return from leave under [section 2612 of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612] after the period of leave to which the employee is entitled has expired; and

            (B)

             the employee fails to return to work for a reason other than—

                (i) the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the employee to leave under subparagraph (C) or (D) of [section 2612(a)(1) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/1] or under [section 2612(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/3]; or

                (ii) other circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

        (3) __Certification__ 

            (A) __Issuance__ 

            An employer may require that a claim that an employee is unable to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of the serious health condition described in paragraph (2)(B)(i) be supported by—

                (i) a certification issued by the health care provider of the son, daughter, spouse, or parent of the employee, as appropriate, in the case of an employee unable to return to work because of a condition specified in [section 2612(a)(1)(C) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/1/C];

                (ii) a certification issued by the health care provider of the eligible employee, in the case of an employee unable to return to work because of a condition specified in [section 2612(a)(1)(D) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/1/D]; or

                (iii) a certification issued by the health care provider of the servicemember being cared for by the employee, in the case of an employee unable to return to work because of a condition specified in [section 2612(a)(3) of this title][/us/usc/t29/s2612/a/3].

            (B) __Copy__ 

                The employee shall provide, in a timely manner, a copy of such certification to the employer.

            (C) __Sufficiency of certification__ 

                (i) __Leave due to serious health condition of employee__ 

                    The certification described in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be sufficient if the certification states that a serious health condition prevented the employee from being able to perform the functions of the position of the employee on the date that the leave of the employee expired.

                (ii) __Leave due to serious health condition of family member__ 

                    The certification described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be sufficient if the certification states that the employee is needed to care for the son, daughter, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition on the date that the leave of the employee expired.
