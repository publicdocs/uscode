    The word “rating” is inserted for clarity. The words “is entitled to” are substituted for the words “shall . . . be entitled to receive and have the same . . . rights”. The last 41 words of section 314 of existing title 37 are omitted, since the sections mentioned therein were repealed by [section 53(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041/s53/b] ([70A Stat. 646][/us/stat/70A/646]). The subject of death benefits and entitlement thereto is now covered by chapter 75 of title 10.
