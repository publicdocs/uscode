    Only that portion of the source law which is applicable to members of the uniformed services and their dependents is codified in this section.

    The words “In this chapter” are substituted for “For the purpose of this Act”.

    In clause (1), the words “with respect to a member of a uniformed service” are inserted for clarity. In clause (1)(A), the word “lawful” is omitted as unnecessary in view of the accepted recognition of the fact that the word “wife” means a lawful wife. In clause (1)(E), the words “Secretary concerned, or his designee” are substituted for “head of the department concerned, or subordinate designated by him” to conform to the definition in [37 U.S.C. 101(5)][/us/usc/t37/s101/5]. The definitions of “person”, “active service”, and “department”, respectively, in 50 App. U.S.C. 1001(a)(1), (b), and (d) are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitions of “member”, “uniformed services”, “active service”, and “Secretary concerned”, in [37 U.S.C. 101(3)][/us/usc/t37/s101/3], (5), (20), and (23).

    The definitions in clauses (2) and (3), which do not appear in, but are based on, the source law are created for legislative convenience.

 __Amendments__ 

    1997—Par. (3)(D). [Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85] substituted “housing” for “quarters”.

    1987—[Pub. L. 100–26][/us/pl/100/26] substituted “In this chapter:” for “In this chapter—”, inserted “The term” at beginning of pars. (1) to (3), and substituted period for semicolon at end of par. (1) and period for “; and” at end of par. (2).

    1985—Par. (1)(A). [Pub. L. 99–145][/us/pl/99/145] substituted “spouse” for “wife”.

 __Effective Date of 1997 Amendment__ 

    Amendment by [Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85] effective Jan. 1, 1998, see [section 603(e) of Pub. L. 105–85][/us/pl/105/85/s603/e], set out as a note under [section 5561 of Title 5][/us/usc/t5/s5561], Government Organization and Employees.
