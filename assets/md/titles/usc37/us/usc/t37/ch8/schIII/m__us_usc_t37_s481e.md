    (a) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is performing temporary duty away from his permanent duty station (or who is assigned to a ship or unit operating away from its home port) may be provided the travel and transportation authorized by [section 474 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s474] for travel performed by the member from his place of temporary duty (or from his ship or unit) to his permanent duty station (or the home port of the ship or unit) or to any other location, and return (if applicable), if such travel has been approved incident to a personal emergency of the member.
