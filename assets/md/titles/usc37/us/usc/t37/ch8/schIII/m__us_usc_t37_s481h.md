        (1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, travel and transportation described in subsection (c) may be provided for not more than three individuals who, with respect to a member described in paragraph (2), are designated individuals for that member if the attending physician or surgeon and the commander or head of the military medical facility exercising control over the member determine, with respect to any such individual, that the presence of such individual may contribute to the member’s health and welfare. In circumstances determined to be appropriate by the Secretary concerned, the Secretary may waive the limitation on the number of designated individuals provided travel and transportation under this section.

In addition, during any period during which there is in effect a non-medical attendant designation for a member under [section 481k of this title][/us/usc/t37/s481k], not more than a total of two roundtrips may be provided under paragraph (1) in any 60-day period at Government expense until there no longer is a designation of a non-medical attendant or that designation transfers to another individual, in which case during the transfer period three roundtrips may be provided.
