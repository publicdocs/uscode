The total reimbursement for transportation for the member’s dependents may not exceed the cost of Government-procured commercial round-trip travel.

    (c) In any case in which a member of the uniformed services is assigned to permanent duty aboard a ship that undergoes a change of home port to the overhaul or inactivation port, the dependents of the member may be provided transportation allowances prescribed in subsections (a) and (b) in lieu of the transportation authorized by [section 476 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s476] and section 2634  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 10.
