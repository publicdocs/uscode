         A member of the uniformed services referred to in paragraph (1) is any of the following:

            (A)

             A member who makes a change of permanent station and the member’s dependents actually make an authorized move in connection with the change, including a move by the dependents—

                (i) to join the member at the member’s duty station after an unaccompanied tour of duty when the member’s next tour of duty is an accompanied tour at the same station; and

                (ii) to a location designated by the member after an accompanied tour of duty when the member’s next tour of duty is an unaccompanied tour at the same duty station.

            (B) A member whose dependents actually move pursuant to section 475a(a), 476(e), 476(h), or 484 of this title.

            (C) A member whose dependents actually move from their place of residence under circumstances described in [section 476a of this title][/us/usc/t37/s476a].

            (D)

             A member who is without dependents and—

                (i) actually moves to a new permanent station where the member is not assigned to quarters of the United States; or

                (ii) actually moves from a place of residence under circumstances described in [section 476a of this title][/us/usc/t37/s476a].

            (E) A member who is ordered to move in connection with the closure or realignment of a military installation and, as a result, the member’s dependents actually move or, in the case of a member without dependents, the member actually moves.

            (F)

             A member whose dependents actually move from the member’s place of residence in connection with the performance of orders for the member to report to the member’s first permanent duty station if the move—

                (i) is to the permanent duty station or a designated location; and

                (ii) is an authorized move.

        (3) If a primary dislocation allowance is paid under this subsection to a member described in subparagraph (C) or (D)(ii) of paragraph (2), the member is not entitled to another dislocation allowance as a member described in subparagraph (A) or (E) of such paragraph in connection with the same move.

        (4) If a primary dislocation allowance is payable to two members described in paragraph (2)(G) who are married to each other, the amount of the allowance payable to such members shall be the amount otherwise payable under this subsection to the member in the higher pay grade, or to either member if both members are in the same pay grade. The allowance shall be paid jointly to both members.

    (b)  __Secondary Allowance Authorized Under Certain Circumstances__  __.—__ 

        (1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, whenever a member is entitled to a primary dislocation allowance under subsection (a) as a member described in paragraph (2)(C) or (2)(D)(ii) of such subsection, the member is also entitled to a secondary dislocation allowance at the rate determined under subsection (c) for the member’s pay grade and dependency status if, subsequent to the member or the member’s dependents actually moving from their place of residence under circumstances described in [section 476a of this title][/us/usc/t37/s476a], the member or member’s dependents complete that move to a new location and then actually move from that new location to another location also under circumstances described in [section 476a of this title][/us/usc/t37/s476a].

        (2) If a secondary dislocation allowance is paid under this subsection, the member is not entitled to a dislocation allowance as a member described in paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(E) of subsection (a) in connection with those moves.

    (c)  __Dislocation Allowance Rates__  __.—__ 

        (1) The amount of the dislocation allowance to be paid under this section to a member shall be based on the member’s pay grade and dependency status at the time the member becomes entitled to the allowance, except that the Secretary concerned may not differentiate between members with dependents in pay grades E–1 through E–5.

        (2) The initial rate for the dislocation allowance, for each pay grade and dependency status, shall be equal to the rate in effect for that pay grade and dependency status on December 31, 1997, as adjusted by the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay for calendar year 1998. Effective on the same date that the monthly rates of basic pay for members are increased for a subsequent calendar year, the Secretary of Defense shall adjust the rates for the dislocation allowance for that calendar year by the percentage equal to the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay for that calendar year.

    (d)  __Fiscal Year Limitation; Exceptions__  __.—__ 

        (1)

    (f)  __Partial Dislocation Allowance__  __.—__ 

        (1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member ordered to occupy or vacate family housing provided by the United States to permit the privatization or renovation of housing or for any other reason (other than pursuant to a permanent change of station) may be paid a partial dislocation allowance of $500.

        (2) Effective on the same date that the monthly rates of basic pay for all members are increased under [section 1009 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s1009] or another provision of law, the Secretary of Defense shall adjust the rate of the partial dislocation allowance authorized by this subsection by the percentage equal to the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay.

        (3) Subsections (c) and (d) do not apply to the partial dislocation allowance authorized by this subsection.
