    (a)  __Repayment Required__  __.—__ 

    Except as provided in subsection (b), a member of the uniformed services or other person who is paid travel and transportation allowances under subchapter I shall repay to the United States any amount of such payment that is determined to be unauthorized or in excess of the applicable authorized amount.

    (b)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

    The regulations prescribed under [section 464 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s464] shall specify procedures for determining the circumstances under which an exception to repayment otherwise required by subsection (a) may be granted.

    (c)  __Effect of Bankruptcy__  __.—__ 

    An obligation to repay the United States under this section is, for all purposes, a debt owed the United States.
