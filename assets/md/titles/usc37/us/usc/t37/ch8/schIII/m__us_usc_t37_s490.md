        (2)

         An eligible dependent child of a member referred to in paragraph (1)(C) is a child who—

    (b)  __Allowance Authorized__  __.—__ 

        (1) A member described in subsection (a) may be paid a transportation allowance for each eligible dependent child of the member of one annual trip between the school being attended by that child and the member’s duty station outside the continental United States and return. The allowance authorized by this section may be transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. However, the transportation authorized by this section may not be paid a member for a child attending a school in the continental United States for the purpose of obtaining a secondary education if the child is eligible to attend a secondary school for dependents that is located at or in the vicinity of the duty station of the member and is operated under the Defense Dependents’ Education Act of 1978 ([20 U.S.C. 921][/us/usc/t20/s921] et seq.).

        (2) The allowance authorized under paragraph (1) for the travel of an eligible dependent may include reimbursement for costs incurred by or on behalf of the dependent for lodging of the dependent that is necessitated by an interruption in the travel caused by extraordinary circumstances prescribed in the regulations under subsection (a). The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined using the rate applicable to such circumstances.

        (3) At the option of the member, in lieu of the transportation of baggage of a dependent child under paragraph (1) from the dependent’s school in the continental United States, the Secretary concerned may pay or reimburse the member for costs incurred to store the baggage at or in the vicinity of the school during the dependent’s annual trip between the school and the member’s duty station or during a different period in the same fiscal year selected by the member. The amount of the payment or reimbursement may not exceed the cost that the Government would incur to transport the baggage.

        (4) The transportation allowance paid under paragraph (1) for an annual trip of an eligible dependent child who is attending a school outside the United States may not exceed the transportation allowance that would be paid under this section for the annual trip of that child between the child’s school in the continental United States and the member’s duty station outside the continental United States and return.

    (c)  __Use of Airlift and Sealift Command__  __.—__ 

    Whenever possible, the Air Mobility Command or Military Sealift Command shall be used, on a space-required basis, for the travel authorized by this section.

    (d)  __Attendance at School in Alaska or Hawaii__  __.—__ 

    For a member assigned to duty outside the continental United States, transportation under this section may be provided a dependent child as described in subsection (a)(2) who is attending a school in Alaska or Hawaii.

    (e)  __Exception__  __.—__ 

    The transportation allowance authorized by this section (whether transportation in kind or reimbursement) may not be paid in the case of a member assigned to a permanent duty station in Alaska or Hawaii for a child attending a school in the State of the permanent duty station.

    (f)  __Definitions__  __.—__ 

    In this section:
