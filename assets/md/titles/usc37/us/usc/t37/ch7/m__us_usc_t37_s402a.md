## § 402a. Supplemental subsistence allowance for low-income members with dependents

    (a)  __Supplemental Allowance Required__  __.—__ 

        (1) The Secretary concerned shall increase the basic allowance for subsistence to which a member of the armed forces described in subsection (b) is otherwise entitled under [section 402 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s402] by an amount (in this section referred to as the “supplemental subsistence allowance”) designed to remove the member’s household from eligibility for benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

        (2) The supplemental subsistence allowance may not exceed $1,100 per month. In establishing the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance to be paid an eligible member under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration the amount of the basic allowance for housing that the member receives under [section 403 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s403] or would otherwise receive under such section, in the case of a member who is not entitled to that allowance as a result of assignment to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service.

        (3)

         In the case of a member described in subsection (b) who establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary concerned that the allotment of the member’s household under the supplemental nutrition assistance program, calculated in the absence of the supplemental subsistence allowance, would exceed the amount established by the Secretary concerned under paragraph (2), the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance for the member shall be equal to the lesser of the following:

            (A) The value of that allotment.

            (B) $1,100.

    (b)  __Members Entitled to Allowance__  __.—__ 

        (1) Subject to subsection (d) and paragraph (4), a member of the armed forces with dependents is entitled to receive the supplemental subsistence allowance if the Secretary concerned determines that the member’s income, together with the income of the rest of the member’s household (if any), is within the highest income standard of eligibility, as then in effect under section 5(c) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 ([7 U.S.C. 2014(c)][/us/usc/t7/s2014/c]) and without regard to paragraph (1) of such section, for participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

        (2) In determining whether a member meets the eligibility criteria under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall take into consideration the amount of the basic allowance for housing that the member receives under [section 403 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s403] or would otherwise receive under such section, in the case of a member who is not entitled to that allowance as a result of assignment to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service.

        (3)

         In determining whether a member meets the eligibility criteria under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall not take into consideration—

            (A) the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance that is payable under this section;

            (C) the amount of any family separation allowance that is payable to the member under [section 427 of this title][/us/usc/t37/s427].

        (4) After September 30, 2016, a member is eligible for a supplemental subsistence allowance under this section only if the member is serving outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, or Guam.

    (c)  __Application for Allowance__  __.—__ 

    To request the supplemental subsistence allowance, a member shall submit an application to the Secretary concerned in such form and containing such information as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. A member applying for the supplemental subsistence allowance shall furnish such evidence regarding the member’s satisfaction of the eligibility criteria under subsection (b) as the Secretary concerned may require.

    (d)  __Effective Period__  __.—__ 

    The entitlement of a member to receive the supplemental subsistence allowance terminates upon the occurrence of any of the following events, even though the member continues to meet the eligibility criteria described in subsection (b):

        (1) Payment of the supplemental subsistence allowance for 12 consecutive months.

        (2) Promotion of the member to a higher grade.

        (3) Transfer of the member in a permanent change of station.

    (e)  __Reapplication__  __.—__ 

    Upon the termination of the effective period of the supplemental subsistence allowance for a member, or in anticipation of the imminent termination of the allowance, a member may reapply for the allowance under subsection (c), and the Secretary concerned shall approve the application and resume payment of the allowance to the member, if the member continues to meet, or once again meets, the eligibility criteria described in subsection (b).

    (f)  __Eligibility for Other Federal Assistance__  __.—__ 

        (1) A child or spouse of a member of the armed forces receiving the supplemental subsistence allowance under this section who, except on account of the receipt of such allowance, would be eligible to receive a benefit described in paragraph (2) shall be considered to be eligible for that benefit notwithstanding the receipt of such allowance.

        (2)

        (3) A household that includes a member of the armed forces receiving the supplemental subsistence allowance under this section and that, except on account of the receipt of such allowance, would be eligible to receive a benefit under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 ([42 U.S.C. 8621][/us/usc/t42/s8621] et seq.) shall be considered to be eligible for that benefit notwithstanding the receipt of such allowance.
