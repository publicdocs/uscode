    1993—Subsec. (a)(4). [Pub. L. 103–160][/us/pl/103/160] added par. (4).

    1991—[Pub. L. 102–190][/us/pl/102/190] amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “In this chapter, the term ‘dependent’, with respect to a member of a uniformed service, means—

    “(1) his spouse;

    “(2) his unmarried child (including any of the following categories of children if such child is in fact dependent on the member: a stepchild; an adopted child; or an illegitimate child whose alleged member-father has been judicially decreed to be the father of the child or judicially ordered to contribute to the child’s support, or whose parentage has been admitted in writing by the member) who either—

    “(A) is under 21 years of age; or

    “(B) is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity, and in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of his support; and

    “(3) his parent (including a stepparent or parent by adoption, and any person, including a former stepparent, who has stood in loco parentis to the member at any time for a continuous period of at least five years before the member became 21 years of age) who is in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of his support; however, the dependency of such a parent is determined on the basis of an affidavit submitted by the parent, and any other evidence required under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, and he is not considered a dependent of the member claiming the dependence unless—

    “(A) the member has provided over one-half of his support for the period prescribed by the Secretary concerned; or

    “(B) due to changed circumstances arising after the member enters on active duty, he becomes in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of his support.

    For the purposes of this section, the relationship between a stepparent and his stepchild is terminated by the stepparent’s divorce from the parent by blood.”

(1) of first sentence, substituted “unmarried child” for “unmarried legitimate child” and defined dependent to include an illegitimate child whose alleged member-father has been judicially decreed to be the father of the child or judicially ordered to contribute to the child’s support, or whose parentage has been admitted in writing by the member.

    Cl. (3). [Pub. L. 93–64, § 104][/us/pl/93/64/s104], in revising cl. (3) of first sentence, substituted “five years before the member became 21 years” for “five years before he became 21 years”, struck out requirement of actual residence of parent in the member’s household, and inserted provision respecting determination of dependency of parent, including items (A) and (B), formerly contained in former section 2201 of Appendix to Title 50, War and National Defense.
