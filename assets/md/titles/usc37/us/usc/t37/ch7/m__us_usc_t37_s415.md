    In subsection (a), the words “Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,” are inserted for clarity. The words “of an armed force” are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 ([66 Stat. 492][/us/stat/66/492]).) The words “of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component” are inserted to reflect the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words “but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37”, are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words “member of a reserve component”. The words “of a reserve component”, in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.

    In subsection (b), the words “heretofore or hereafter” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c), the words “An officer” are substituted for the words “any individual”, since the revised section applies only to officers.

    In subsection (d), the words “who is in pay grade O–1, O–2, or O–3” are substituted for the words “is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade” to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.

    In subsection (e), the words “as a temporary officer” are inserted for clarity. The words “5596 or” are substituted for [section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947][/us/act/1947-08-07/s302/f], cited above.
