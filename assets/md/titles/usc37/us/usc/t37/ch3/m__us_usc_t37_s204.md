    (c) A member of the National Guard who is called into Federal service for a period of 30 days or less is entitled to basic pay from the date when he appears at the place of company rendezvous.

If a member receives a payment under this subsection but dies before that payment would have been made but for this subsection, no part of that payment may be recovered by the United States.

            (A) in line of duty while performing active duty;

            (B) in line of duty while performing inactive-duty training (other than work or study in connection with a correspondence course of an armed force or attendance in an inactive status at an educational institution under the sponsorship of an armed force or the Public Health Service);

        (2) In the case of a member who receives earned income from nonmilitary employment or self-employment performed in any month in which the member is otherwise entitled to pay and allowances under paragraph (1), the total pay and allowances shall be reduced by the amount of such income. In calculating earned income for the purpose of the preceding sentence, income from an income protection plan, vacation pay, or sick leave which the member elects to receive shall be considered.

    (h)

        (1)

         A member of a reserve component of a uniformed service who is physically able to perform his military duties, is entitled, upon request, to a portion of the monthly pay and allowances provided by law or regulation for a member of a regular component of a uniformed service of corresponding grade and length of service for each month for which the member demonstrates a loss of earned income from nonmilitary employment or self-employment as a result of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated—

            (A) in line of duty while performing active duty;

            (B) in line of duty while performing inactive-duty training (other than work or study in connection with a correspondence course of an armed force or attendance in an inactive status at an educational institution under the sponsorship of an armed force or the Public Health Service);

            (C) while traveling directly to or from such duty or training;

            (D) in line of duty while remaining overnight immediately before the commencement of inactive-duty training, or while remaining overnight, between successive periods of inactive-duty training, at or in the vicinity of the site of the inactive-duty training; or

            (E)

             in line of duty while—

                (i) serving on funeral honors duty under [section 12503 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s12503] or [section 115 of title 32][/us/usc/t32/s115];

                (ii) traveling to or from the place at which the duty was to be performed; or

                (iii) remaining overnight at or in the vicinity of that place immediately before so serving, if the place is outside reasonable commuting distance from the member’s residence.

        (2) The monthly entitlement may not exceed the member’s demonstrated loss of earned income from nonmilitary or self-employment. In calculating such loss of income, income from an income protection plan, vacation pay, or sick leave which the member elects to receive shall be considered.

    (i)

        (1) The total amount of pay and allowances paid under subsections (g) and (h) and compensation paid under [section 206(a) of this title][/us/usc/t37/s206/a] for any period may not exceed the amount of pay and allowances provided by law or regulation for a member of a regular component of a uniformed service of corresponding grade and length of service for that period.

    \[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.\]

    In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words “or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended,” to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words “on the active list” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words “(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)” are omitted as covered by the words “provided by law”.

    In subsection (b), the words “For the purposes of subsection (a)” are inserted for clarity. The words “active duty for a period of more than 30 days” are substituted for the words “extended active duty in excess of thirty days”. The words “call or” are inserted to conform to the words “called or”.

    In subsection (c), the words “and allowances” are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.

    In subsection (d), the words “for the purposes of this section” are substituted for the words “and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States”. The words “pursuant to this section” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (e), the words “or active duty for training” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.

    In subsection (f), the words “is appointed” are substituted for the words “has been or may be commissioned”. The words “under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army” and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words “to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission” are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words “or the United States Naval Academy” are inserted to reflect [section 541 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s541], under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.

    In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in [section 755(c) of title 14][/us/usc/t14/s755/c].
