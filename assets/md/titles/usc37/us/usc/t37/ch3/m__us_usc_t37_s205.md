    In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word “officer” is substituted for the words “commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer” to conform to the definition of “officer” in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words “Regular or Reserve component” are omitted, since, under the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words “a reserve component of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers’ Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy . . . or in the Naval Reserve . . . or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers’ section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve . . . or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,” since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words “as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947” are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date “January 1, 1961,” is substituted for the words “the effective date of this section,” to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, [Public Law 86–142][/us/pl/86/142]. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.

    In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words “are computed by adding” in subsection (a). The words “for any reason,” in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (c)(3), the words “chapter 67 of title 10” are substituted for the words “title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948,” since that title was repealed by [section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041][/us/act/1956-08-10/ch1041/s53] ([70A Stat. 641][/us/stat/70A/641]), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.
