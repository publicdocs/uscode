    In subsections (a)–(j), the words “and allowances” are omitted as surplusage, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances is based upon entitlement to basic pay.

    In subsection (f), the words “provided by law”, “this or any other”, and “for any reason” are omitted as surplusage.

    In subsection (g), the words “Judge Advocate General of the Navy” are inserted to reflect [section 5148 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s5148].
