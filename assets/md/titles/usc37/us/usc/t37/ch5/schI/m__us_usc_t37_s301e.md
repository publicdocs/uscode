        (2) The amount of a retention bonus under paragraph (1) may not exceed $50,000 for each year covered by a four-year agreement. The maximum yearly retention bonus for two-year and three-year agreements shall be reduced to reflect the shorter service commitment.

    (c)  __Extension of Bonus to Other Dental Officers__  __.—__ 

    At the discretion of the Secretary of the military department concerned, the Secretary may enter into a written agreement described in subsection (a)(1) with a dental officer who does not have the dental specialty specified in subsection (b)(2), and pay a retention bonus to such an officer as provided in this section, if the officer otherwise satisfies the eligibility requirements specified in subsection (b). The Secretaries shall exercise the authority provided in this section in a manner consistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.

    (d)  __Repayment__  __.—__ 

    An officer who does not complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement entered into under subsection (a) shall be subject to the repayment provisions of [section 303a(e) of this title][/us/usc/t37/s303a/e].
