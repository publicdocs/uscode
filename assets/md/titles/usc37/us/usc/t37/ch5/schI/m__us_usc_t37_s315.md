        (2) that requires a skill designated (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense for the armed forces, by the Secretary of Commerce for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Public Health Service) as critical and as a skill in which there is a critical shortage of officers in the uniformed service concerned.

    (b)

     Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an officer of a uniformed service who—

        (1) is entitled to basic pay;

        (2) is below the pay grade of O–7;
