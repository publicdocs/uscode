    In subsection (a), clause (1) is substituted for section 234(a)(1), (2), and (3) of existing title 37. The words “of the Regular Army or the Regular Navy” and “of the Regular Air Force” are inserted in clauses (1)(A) and (B), respectively, since, in contradistinction to section 234(a)(4) of existing title 37, their source was intended to apply only to regular officers. Clauses (2) (A) and (B) are substituted for the enumeration of categories in section 234(a)(4) of existing title 37 to reflect current usage and designation of those categories. Clause (3) is substituted for section 234(a)(5) and (6) of existing title 37.

    In subsection (c), the words “disability retirement pay” are omitted as covered by the words “retired pay”. Section 234(b) (2d proviso) of existing title 37 is omitted as obsolete.
