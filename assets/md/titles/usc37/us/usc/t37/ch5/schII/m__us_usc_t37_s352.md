                (i) a monthly rate specified in the written agreement entered into under subsection (c), which monthly rate may not exceed the maximum monthly rate authorized under paragraph (2) at the time the member enters into the agreement; and

                (ii) the number of continuous months in the period for which the assignment or special duty pay will be paid; divided by

            (B) the number of installments over such period.

        (5) __Effect of extension.—__
