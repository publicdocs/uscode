    (2)

     in the case of a proposed change of either educational institution or program of education by the eligible person—

        (A) the cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress has been removed;

        (B) the program proposed to be pursued is suitable to the eligible person’s aptitudes, interests, and abilities; and

        (C) if a proposed change of program is involved, the change meets the requirements for approval under [section 3691 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s3691].
