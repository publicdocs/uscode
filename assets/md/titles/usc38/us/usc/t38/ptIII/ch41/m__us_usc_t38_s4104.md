    (a)  __Requirement for Employment by States of a Sufficient Number of Representatives__  __.—__ 

    Subject to approval by the Secretary, a State shall employ such full- and part-time local veterans’ employment representatives as the State determines appropriate and efficient to carry out employment, training, and placement services under this chapter.

    (b)  __Principal Duties__  __.—__ 

    As principal duties, local veterans’ employment representatives shall—

        (1) conduct outreach to employers in the area to assist veterans in gaining employment, including conducting seminars for employers and, in conjunction with employers, conducting job search workshops and establishing job search groups; and

        (2) facilitate employment, training, and placement services furnished to veterans in a State under the applicable State employment service delivery systems.

    (c)  __Requirement for Qualified Veterans and Eligible Persons__  __.—__ 

    A State shall, to the maximum extent practicable, employ qualified veterans or eligible persons to carry out the services referred to in subsection (a). Preference shall be accorded in the following order:

        (1) To qualified service-connected disabled veterans.

        (2) If no veteran described in paragraph (1) is available, to qualified eligible veterans.

        (3) If no veteran described in paragraph (1) or (2) is available, then to qualified eligible persons.

    (d)  __Part-Time Employees__  __.—__ 

    A part-time local veterans’ employment representative shall perform the functions of a local veterans’ employment representative under this section on a half-time basis.

    (e)  __Additional Requirements for Full-time Employees__  __.—__

        (2) The Secretary shall conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with paragraph (1). If, on the basis of such an audit, the Secretary determines that a State is not in compliance with paragraph (1), the Secretary may reduce the amount of a grant made to the State under [section 4102A(b)(5) of this title][/us/usc/t38/s4102A/b/5].
