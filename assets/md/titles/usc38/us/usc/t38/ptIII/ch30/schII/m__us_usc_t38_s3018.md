            (C) before completing such obligated period of service, is (i) discharged or released from active duty for the convenience of the Government after completing not less than 20 months of such period of service, if such period was less than three years, or 30 months, if such period was at least three years, or (ii) involuntarily discharged or released from active duty for the convenience of the Government as a result of a reduction in force, as determined by the Secretary concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense;

    (c)

     The basic pay of an individual withdrawing, under subsection (b)(1) of this section, an election under section 3011(c)(1) or 3012(d)(1) of this title shall be reduced by—

        (1) $1,200; or

        (2) in the case of an individual described in clause (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(3) of this section whose discharge or release from active duty prevents the reduction of the basic pay of such individual by $1,200, an amount less than $1,200.

    (d) A withdrawal under subsection (b)(1) of this section is irrevocable.
