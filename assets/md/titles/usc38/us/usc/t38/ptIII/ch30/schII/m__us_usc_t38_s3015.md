    (b)

     In the case of an individual entitled to an educational assistance allowance under section 3011 or 3018 of this title whose obligated period of active duty on which such entitlement is based is two years, a basic educational assistance allowance under this chapter shall (except as provided in the succeeding subsections of this section) be paid—

        (2) The number of months for which the rate of the basic educational assistance allowance applicable to an individual is increased under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not exceed the number of months of entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 34 of this title that the individual had remaining on December 31, 1989.

        (1) an amount equal to $5 for each $20 contributed by such individual under section 3011(e) or 3012(f) of this title, as the case may be, for an approved program of education pursued on a full-time basis; or

        (2) an appropriately reduced amount based on the amount so contributed, as determined under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for an approved program of education pursued on less than a full-time basis.

    (h)

        (1)

         With respect to any fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide a percentage increase in the rates payable under subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) equal to the percentage by which—

            (A) the average cost of undergraduate tuition in the United States, as determined by the National Center for Education Statistics, for the last academic year preceding the beginning of the fiscal year for which the increase is made, exceeds

            (B) the average cost of undergraduate tuition in the United States, as so determined, for the academic year preceding the academic year described in subparagraph (A).

        (2) Any increase under paragraph (1) in a rate with respect to a fiscal year after fiscal year 2004 and before fiscal year 2014 shall be rounded down to the next lower whole dollar amount.
