## § 8162. Enhanced-use leases

    (a)

        (1) The Secretary may in accordance with this subchapter enter into leases with respect to real property that is under the jurisdiction or control of the Secretary. Any such lease under this subchapter may be referred to as an “enhanced-use lease”. The Secretary may dispose of any such property that is leased to another party under this subchapter in accordance with [section 8164 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s8164]. The Secretary may exercise the authority provided by this subchapter notwithstanding [section 8122 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s8122], subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 40, sections 541–555 and 1302 of title 40, or any other provision of law (other than Federal laws relating to environmental and historic preservation) inconsistent with this section. The applicability of this subchapter to section 421(b) of the Veterans’ Benefits and Services Act of 1988 ([Public Law 100–322][/us/pl/100/322]; [102 Stat. 553][/us/stat/102/553]) is covered by subsection (c).

        (2) The Secretary may enter into an enhanced-use lease only for the provision of supportive housing and if the lease is not inconsistent with and will not adversely affect the mission of the Department.

        (3) The provisions of sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40 shall not, by reason of this section, become inapplicable to property that is leased to another party under an enhanced-use lease.

        (4) A property that is leased to another party under an enhanced-use lease may not be considered to be unutilized or underutilized for purposes of section 501 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act ([42 U.S.C. 11411][/us/usc/t42/s11411]).

    (b)

        (1) If the Secretary has determined that a property should be leased to another party through an enhanced-use lease, the Secretary shall, at the Secretary’s discretion, select the party with whom the lease will be entered into using such selection procedures as the Secretary considers appropriate.

        (2) The term of an enhanced-use lease may not exceed 75 years.

        (3)

            (A) For any enhanced-use lease entered into by the Secretary, the lease consideration provided to the Secretary shall consist solely of cash at fair value as determined by the Secretary.

            (B) The Secretary shall receive no other type of consideration for an enhanced-use lease besides cash.

            (C) The Secretary may enter into an enhanced-use lease without receiving consideration.

        (4) The terms of an enhanced-use lease may provide for the Secretary to use minor construction funds for capital contribution payments.

        (5) The terms of an enhanced-use lease may not provide for any acquisition, contract, demonstration, exchange, grant, incentive, procurement, sale, other transaction authority, service agreement, use agreement, lease, or lease-back by the Secretary or Federal Government.

        (6) The Secretary may not enter into an enhanced-use lease without certification in advance in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that such lease complies with the requirements of this subchapter.

    (c) The entering into an enhanced-use lease covering any land or improvement described in section 421(b)(2) of the Veterans’ Benefits and Services Act of 1988 ([Public Law 100–322][/us/pl/100/322]; [102 Stat. 553][/us/stat/102/553]) or section 224(a) of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 shall be considered to be prohibited by such sections unless specifically authorized by law.
