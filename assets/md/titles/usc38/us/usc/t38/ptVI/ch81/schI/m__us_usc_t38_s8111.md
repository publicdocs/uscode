> “SEC. 207. __AUTHORITY TO BILL HEALTH-PLAN CONTRACTS.__ 

>     “(a)  __Right To Recover__  __.—__ 

>     In the case of a primary beneficiary (as described in section 201(a)(2)(B)) who has coverage under a health-plan contract, as defined in [section 1729(i)(1)(A) of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1729/i/1/A], United States Code, and who is furnished care or services by a Department medical facility pursuant to this title, the United States shall have the right to recover or collect charges for such care or services from such health-plan contract to the extent that the beneficiary (or the provider of the care or services) would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such health-plan contract if the care or services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States. Any funds received from such health-plan contract shall be credited to funds that have been allotted to the facility that furnished the care or services.

>     “(b)  __Enforcement__  __.—__ 

>     The right of the United States to recover under such a beneficiary’s health-plan contract shall be enforceable in the same manner as that provided by subsections (a)(3), (b), (c)(1), (d), (f), (h), and (i) of [section 1729 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1729], United States Code.”

 __Congressional Findings__ 

[Pub. L. 97–174, § 2(a)][/us/pl/97/174/s2/a], May 4, 1982, [96 Stat. 70][/us/stat/96/70], provided that: 

> “The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) There are opportunities for greater sharing of the health-care resources of the Veterans’ Administration and the Department of Defense which would, if achieved, be beneficial to both veterans and members of the Armed Forces and could result in reduced costs to the Government by minimizing duplication and underuse of health-care resources.

>     “(2) Present incentives to encourage such sharing of health-care resources are inadequate.

>     “(3) Such sharing of health-care resources can be achieved without a detrimental effect on the primary health-care beneficiaries of the Veterans’ Administration and the Department of Defense.”

 __Executive Order No. 13214__ 

    Ex. Ord. No. 13214, May 28, 2001, 66 F.R. 29447, which established President’s Task Force to Improve Health Care Delivery for Our Nation’s Veterans, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13316, § 3(h), Sept. 17, 2003, 68 F.R. 55256, eff. Sept. 30, 2003.
