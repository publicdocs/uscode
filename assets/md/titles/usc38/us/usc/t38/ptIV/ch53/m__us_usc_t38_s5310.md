        (1)

         A surviving spouse of a veteran is entitled to a benefit for the month of the veteran’s death if—

            (A) at the time of the veteran’s death, the veteran was receiving compensation or pension under chapter 11 or 15 of this title; or

            (B) the veteran is determined for purposes of section 5121 or 5121A of this title as having been entitled to receive compensation or pension under chapter 11 or 15 of this title for the month of the veteran’s death.
