L. 103–446, § 1201(e)(16)(A)][/us/pl/103/446/s1201/e/16/A], (B), inserted “(a)” before “Any person desiring” and substituted “custody of the Secretary that may be disclosed under [section 5701 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s5701] must submit to the Secretary an application in writing for such copy. The application shall state” for “custody of the Secretary, which may be disclosed under [section 5701 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s5701], must make written application therefor to the Secretary, stating”.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 103–446, § 1201(e)(16)(C)][/us/pl/103/446/s1201/e/16/C], which directed amendment of subsec.
