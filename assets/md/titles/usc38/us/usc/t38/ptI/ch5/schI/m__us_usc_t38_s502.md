## § 502. Judicial review of rules and regulations

    An action of the Secretary to which section 552(a)(1) or 553 of title 5 (or both) refers is subject to judicial review.

However, if such review is sought in connection with an appeal brought under the provisions of chapter 72 of this title, the provisions of that chapter shall apply rather than the provisions of chapter 7 of title 5.
