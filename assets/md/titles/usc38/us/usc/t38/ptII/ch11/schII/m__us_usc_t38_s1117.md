## § 1117. Compensation for disabilities occurring in Persian Gulf War veterans

    (a)

        (1)

         The Secretary may pay compensation under this subchapter to a Persian Gulf veteran with a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest—

            (A) during service on active duty in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; or

            (B) to a degree of 10 percent or more during the presumptive period prescribed under subsection (b).

        (2)

         For purposes of this subsection, the term “qualifying chronic disability” means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any combination of any of the following):

            (A) An undiagnosed illness.

            (B) A medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms.

            (C) Any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under subsection (d) warrants a presumption of service-connection.

    (b) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the period of time following service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War that the Secretary determines is appropriate for presumption of service connection for purposes of this section. The Secretary’s determination of such period of time shall be made following a review of any available credible medical or scientific evidence and the historical treatment afforded disabilities for which manifestation periods have been established and shall take into account other pertinent circumstances regarding the experiences of veterans of the Persian Gulf War.

    (c)

        (1)

         Whenever the Secretary determines under [section 1118(c) of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1118/c] that a presumption of service connection previously established under this section is no longer warranted—

            (A) a veteran who was awarded compensation under this section on the basis of the presumption shall continue to be entitled to receive compensation under this section on that basis; and

            (B) a survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency and indemnity compensation for the death of a veteran resulting from the disease on the basis of the presumption before that date shall continue to be entitled to receive dependency and indemnity compensation on that basis.

        (2) This subsection shall cease to be effective on September 30, 2011.

    (d)

        (1) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.

        (2)

         Those regulations shall include the following:

            (A) A description of the period and geographical area or areas of military service in connection with which compensation under this section may be paid.

            (B) A description of the illnesses for which compensation under this section may be paid.

            (C) A description of any relevant medical characteristic (such as a latency period) associated with each such illness.

    (e) A disability for which compensation under this subchapter is payable shall be considered to be service connected for purposes of all other laws of the United States.

    (f) For purposes of this section, the term “Persian Gulf veteran” means a veteran who served on active duty in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.

    (g)

     For purposes of this section, signs or symptoms that may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness or a chronic multisymptom illness include the following:

        (1) Fatigue.

        (2) Unexplained rashes or other dermatological signs or symptoms.

        (3) Headache.

        (4) Muscle pain.

        (5) Joint pain.

        (6) Neurological signs and symptoms.

        (7) Neuropsychological signs or symptoms.

        (8) Signs or symptoms involving the upper or lower respiratory system.

        (9) Sleep disturbances.

        (10) Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms.

        (11) Cardiovascular signs or symptoms.

        (12) Abnormal weight loss.

        (13) Menstrual disorders.

    (h)

        (1) If the Secretary determines with respect to a medical research project sponsored by the Department that it is necessary for the conduct of the project that Persian Gulf veterans in receipt of compensation under this section or [section 1118 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1118] participate in the project without the possibility of loss of service connection under either such section, the Secretary shall provide that service connection granted under either such section for disability of a veteran who participated in the research project may not be terminated. Except as provided in paragraph (2), notwithstanding any other provision of law any grant of service-connection protected under this subsection shall remain service-connected for purposes of all provisions of law under this title.

        (2)

         Paragraph (1) does not apply in a case in which—

            (A) the original award of compensation or service connection was based on fraud; or

            (B) it is clearly shown from military records that the person concerned did not have the requisite service or character of discharge.

        (3) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a list of medical research projects sponsored by the Department for which service connection granted under this section or [section 1118 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1118] may not be terminated pursuant to paragraph (1).

> “SEC. 102. __FINDINGS.__ 

> “The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) During the Persian Gulf War, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including fumes and smoke from military operations, oil well fires, diesel exhaust, paints, pesticides, depleted uranium, infectious agents, investigational drugs and vaccines, and indigenous diseases, and were also given multiple immunizations. It is not known whether these servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. However, threats of enemy use of chemical and biological warfare heightened the psychological stress associated with the military operation.

>     “(2) Significant numbers of veterans of the Persian Gulf War are suffering from illnesses, or are exhibiting symptoms of illness, that cannot now be diagnosed or clearly defined. As a result, many of these conditions or illnesses are not considered to be service connected under current law for purposes of benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

>     “(3) The National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Workshop on the Persian Gulf Experience and Health, held in April 1994, concluded that the complex biological, chemical, physical, and psychological environment of the Southwest Asia theater of operations produced complex adverse health effects in Persian Gulf War veterans and that no single disease entity or syndrome is apparent. Rather, it may be that the illnesses suffered by those veterans result from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes that have yet to be defined.

>     “(4) That workshop concluded that the information concerning the range and intensity of exposure to toxic substances by military personnel in the Southwest Asia theater of operations is very limited and that such information was collected only after a considerable delay.

>     “(5) In response to concerns regarding the health-care needs of Persian Gulf War veterans, particularly those who suffer from illnesses or conditions for which no diagnosis has been made, the Congress, in [Public Law 102–585][/us/pl/102/585] \[see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s101]\], directed the establishment of a Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Registry, authorized health examinations for veterans of the Persian Gulf War, and provided for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of information regarding the health consequences of military service in the Persian Gulf theater of operations and to develop recommendations on avenues for research regarding such health consequences. In [Public Law 103–210][/us/pl/103/210] \[see Tables for classification\], the Congress authorized the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care services on a priority basis to Persian Gulf War veterans. The Congress also provided in [Public Law 103–160][/us/pl/103/160] (the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994) \[see Tables for classification\] for the establishment of a specialized environmental medical facility for the conduct of research into the possible health effects of exposure to low levels of hazardous chemicals, especially among Persian Gulf veterans, and for research into the possible health effects of battlefield exposure in such veterans to depleted uranium.

>     “(6) In response to concerns about the lack of objective research on Gulf War illnesses, Congress included research provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 \[[Pub. L. 103–337][/us/pl/103/337], see Tables for classification\], which was passed by the House and Senate in September 1994. This legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to provide research grants to non-Federal researchers to support three types of studies of the Gulf War syndrome. The first type of study will be an epidemiological study or studies of the incidence, prevalence, and nature of the illness and symptoms and the risk factors associated with symptoms or illnesses. This will include illnesses among spouses and birth defects and illnesses among offspring born before and after the Gulf War. The second group of studies shall be conducted to determine the health consequences of the use of pyridostigmine bromide as a pretreatment antidote enhancer during the Persian Gulf War, alone or in combination with exposure to pesticides, environmental toxins, and other hazardous substances. The final group of studies shall include clinical research and other studies on the causes, possible transmission, and treatment of Gulf War syndrome, and will include studies of veterans and their spouses and children.

>     “(7) Further research and studies must be undertaken to determine the underlying causes of the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and, pending the outcome of such research, veterans who are seriously ill as the result of such illnesses should be given the benefit of the doubt and be provided compensation benefits to offset the impairment in earnings capacities they may be experiencing.

> “SEC. 103. __PURPOSES.__ 

> “The purposes of this title \[see Short Title of 1994 Amendments note under [section 101 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s101]\] are—

>     “(1) to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from illnesses that cannot now be diagnosed or defined, and for which other causes cannot be identified;

>     “(2) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop at the earliest possible date case assessment strategies and definitions or diagnoses of such illnesses;

>     “(3) to promote greater outreach to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families to inform them of ongoing research activities, as well as the services and benefits to which they are currently entitled; and

>     “(4) to ensure that research activities and accompanying surveys of Persian Gulf War veterans are appropriately funded and undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

> “SEC. 104. __DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL EVALUATION PROTOCOL.__ 

>     “(a) __Uniform Medical Evaluation Protocol.—__

>         “(4)

>             (A) If the Secretary is unable to diagnose the symptoms or illness of a veteran provided an evaluation, or if the symptoms or illness of a veteran do not respond to treatment provided by the Secretary, the Secretary may use the authority in [section 1703 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s1703], United States Code, in order to provide for the veteran to receive diagnostic tests or treatment at a non-Department medical facility that may have the capability of diagnosing or treating the symptoms or illness of the veteran. The Secretary may provide the veteran the travel and incidental expenses therefor pursuant to the provisions of [section 111 of title 38][/us/usc/t38/s111], United States Code.

>             “(B) The Secretary shall request from each non-Department medical facility that examines or treats a veteran under this paragraph such information relating to the diagnosis or treatment as the Secretary considers appropriate.

>         “(5) In each year after the implementation of the protocol, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement appropriate experts shall review the adequacy of the protocol and its implementation by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

>     “(b) __Relationship to Other Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Protocols.—__ 

>     The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall ensure that the information collected through the protocol described in this section is collected and maintained in a manner that permits the effective and efficient cross-reference of that information with information collected and maintained through the comprehensive clinical protocols of the Department of Defense for Persian Gulf War veterans.

>     “(c) __Case Definitions and Diagnoses.—__ 

>     The Secretary shall develop case definitions or diagnoses for illnesses associated with the service described in subsection (a)(1). The Secretary shall develop such definitions or diagnoses at the earliest possible date.

> “SEC. 105. __OUTREACH TO PERSIAN GULF VETERANS.__ 

>     “(a) __In General.—__ 

>     The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall implement a comprehensive outreach program to inform Persian Gulf War veterans and their families of the medical care and other benefits that may be provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense arising from service in the Persian Gulf War.

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1. Extension. The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses (the “Committee”), established pursuant to Executive Order 12961 \[set out above\] of May 26, 1995, is hereby extended for the purposes set forth herein. All provisions of that order relating to membership and administration shall remain in effect. All Committee appointments, as well as the President’s designation of a Chairperson, shall remain in effect. The limitations set forth in section 2(c)–(e) and section 4(a) of Executive Order 12961 shall also remain in effect. The Committee shall remain subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.

    Sec. 2. Functions. (a) The Committee shall report to the President through the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

    (b) The Committee shall have two principal roles:

    (1) Oversight of the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Department of Defense with the assistance, as appropriate, of other executive departments and agencies into possible chemical or biological warfare agent exposures during the Gulf War; and

    (2) Evaluation of the Federal Government’s plan for and progress towards the implementation of the Committee’s recommendations contained in its Final Report submitted on December 31, 1996.

    (c) The Committee shall provide advice and recommendations related to its oversight and evaluation responsibilities.

    (d) The Committee may also provide additional advice and recommendations prompted by any new developments related to its original functions as set forth in section 2(b) of Executive Order 12961.

    Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) The Committee shall terminate 30 days after submitting its final supplemental report.

    (b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and it is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

                              William J. Clinton.
