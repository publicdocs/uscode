## § 1724. Hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care abroad

    (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), the Secretary shall not furnish hospital or domiciliary care or medical services outside any State.

    (b)

        (1) The Secretary may furnish hospital care and medical services outside a State to a veteran who is otherwise eligible to receive hospital care and medical services if the Secretary determines that such care and services are needed for the treatment of a service-connected disability of the veteran or as part of a rehabilitation program under chapter 31 of this title.

        (2)

         Care and services for a service-connected disability of a veteran who is not a citizen of the United States may be furnished under this subsection only—

            (A) if the veteran is in the Republic of the Philippines or in Canada; or

            (B) if the Secretary determines, as a matter of discretion and pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, that it is appropriate and feasible to furnish such care and services.

    (c) Within the limits of those facilities of the Veterans Memorial Medical Center at Manila, Republic of the Philippines, for which the Secretary may contract, the Secretary may furnish necessary hospital care to a veteran for any non-service-connected disability if such veteran is unable to defray the expenses of necessary hospital care. The Secretary may enter into contracts to carry out this section.

    (d) The Secretary may furnish nursing home care, on the same terms and conditions set forth in [section 1720(a) of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1720/a], to any veteran who has been furnished hospital care in the Philippines pursuant to this section, but who requires a protracted period of nursing home care.
