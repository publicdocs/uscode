            (C) to a veteran whose annual income (as determined under [section 1503 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1503]) does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension which would be payable to such veteran if such veteran were eligible for pension under [section 1521 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1521].

    (b)
