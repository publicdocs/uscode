## § 1154. Consideration to be accorded time, place, and circumstances of service

    (a) The Secretary shall include in the regulations pertaining to service-connection of disabilities (1) additional provisions in effect requiring that in each case where a veteran is seeking service-connection for any disability due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran’s service as shown by such veteran’s service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran’s medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence, and (2) the provisions required by section 5 of the Veterans’ Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act ([Public Law 98–542][/us/pl/98/542]; [98 Stat. 2727][/us/stat/98/2727]).

    (b) In the case of any veteran who engaged in combat with the enemy in active service with a military, naval, or air organization of the United States during a period of war, campaign, or expedition, the Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of service-connection of any disease or injury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation in such service, and, to that end, shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. Service-connection of such injury or disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The reasons for granting or denying service-connection in each case shall be recorded in full.

>  __“short title__ 

> “Section 1. This Act \[amending this section, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, and amending provisions set out as notes under this section and [section 1116 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1116]\] may be cited as the ‘Veterans’ Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act’.

>  __“findings__ 

> “Sec. 2.

>  The Congress makes the following findings:

>     “(1) Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear tests or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, are deeply concerned about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.

>     “(2) There is scientific and medical uncertainty regarding such long-term adverse health effects.

>     “(3) In [section 102 of Public Law 97–22][/us/pl/97/22/s102] \[see Tables for classification\], the Congress responded to that uncertainty by authorizing priority medical care at Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] facilities for any disability of a veteran who may have been so exposed (even though there is insufficient medical evidence linking such disability with such exposure) unless the disability is found to have resulted from a cause other than the exposure.

>     “(4) The Congress has further responded to that medical and scientific uncertainty by requiring, in [section 307 of Public Law 96–151][/us/pl/96/151/s307] \[set out as a note under [section 1116 of this title][/us/usc/t38/s1116]\] and [section 601 of Public Law 98–160][/us/pl/98/160/s601] \[set out below\], the conduct of thorough epidemiological studies of the health effects experienced by veterans in connection with exposure both to herbicides containing dioxin and (if not determined to be scientifically infeasible) to radiation, and by requiring in [Public Law 97–414][/us/pl/97/414] \[see Tables for classification\], the development of radioepidemiological tables setting forth the probabilities of causation between various cancers and exposure to radiation.

>     “(5) There is some evidence that most types of leukemia, malignancies of the thyroid, female breast, lung, bone, liver, and skin, and polycythemia vera are associated with exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation.

>     “(6) As of the date of the enactment of this Act \[Oct. 24, 1984\], there are sixty-six federally sponsored research projects being conducted relating to herbicides containing dioxin, at a cost to the Federal Government in excess of $130,000,000 and, as of 1981, federally sponsored research projects relating to ionizing radiation were costing the Federal Government more than $115,000,000.

>     “(7) The initial results of one project—an epidemiological study, conducted by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, of the health status of the ‘Ranch Hand’ veterans who carried out the loading and aerial spraying of herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam and in the process came into direct skin contact with such herbicides in their most concentrated liquid form—were released on February 24, 1984, and contained the conclusion ‘that there is insufficient evidence to support a cause and effect relationship between herbicide exposure and adverse health in the Ranch Hand group at this time’.

>     “(8) The ‘film badges’ which were originally issued to members of the Armed Forces in connection with the atmospheric nuclear test program have previously constituted a primary source of dose information for veterans (and survivors of veterans) filing claims for Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in connection with exposure to radiation.

>     “(9) These film badges often provide an incomplete measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses (although the Defense Nuclear Agency currently has the capability to reconstruct individual estimates of such doses), were not issued to most of the participants in nuclear tests, often provided questionable readings because they were shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.

>     “(10) Standards governing the reporting of dose estimates in connection with radiation-related claims for Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] disability compensation vary among the several branches of the Armed Forces, and no uniform minimum standards exist.

>     “(11) The Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] has not promulgated permanent regulations setting forth specific guidelines, standards, and criteria for the adjudication of claims for Veterans’ Administration disability compensation based on exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.

>     “(12) Such claims (especially those involving health effects with long latency periods) present adjudicatory issues which are significantly different from issues generally presented in claims based upon the usual types of injuries incurred in military service.

>     “(13) It has always been the policy of the Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] and is the policy of the United States, with respect to individual claims for service connection of diseases and disabilities, that when, after consideration of all evidence and material of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a claim, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.

>  __“purpose__ 

> “Sec. 3. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Veterans’ Administration \[now Department of Veterans Affairs\] disability compensation is provided to veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation in connection with atmospheric nuclear tests or in connection with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, for all disabilities arising after that service that are connected, based on sound scientific and medical evidence, to such service (and that Veterans’ Administration dependency and indemnity compensation is provided to survivors of those veterans for all deaths resulting from such disabilities).”
