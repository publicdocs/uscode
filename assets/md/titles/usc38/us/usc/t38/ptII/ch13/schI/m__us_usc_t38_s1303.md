## § 1303. Cost-of-living adjustments

    (a) In the computation of cost-of-living adjustments for fiscal years 1998 through 2013 in the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this chapter, such adjustments (except as provided in subsection (b)) shall be made by a uniform percentage that is no more than the percentage equal to the social security increase for that fiscal year, with all increased monthly rates (other than increased rates equal to a whole dollar amount) rounded down to the next lower whole dollar amount.

    (b) For purposes of this section, the term “social security increase” means the percentage by which benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act ([42 U.S.C. 401][/us/usc/t42/s401] et seq.) are increased for any fiscal year as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act ([42 U.S.C. 415(i)][/us/usc/t42/s415/i]).
