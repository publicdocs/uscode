             The criterion described in this subparagraph is that the disability—

                (i) was incurred on or after September 11, 2001; and

                (ii) is due to the loss or loss of use of one or more lower extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.

        (3)

         The regulations prescribed under subsection (d) shall require that assistance under paragraph (1) may be provided to a veteran only if the Secretary finds that—

            (A) it is medically feasible for the veteran to reside in the proposed housing unit and in the proposed locality;

            (B) the proposed housing unit bears a proper relation to the veteran’s present and anticipated income and expenses; and
