## § 591. Purchase of electricity

    (a) __General Limitation on Use of Amounts.—__ 

    A department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government may not use amounts appropriated or made available by any law to purchase electricity in a manner inconsistent with state law governing the provision of electric utility service, including—

        (1) state utility commission rulings; and

        (2) electric utility franchises or service territories established under state statute, state regulation, or state-approved territorial agreements.

    (b) __Exceptions.—__ 

        (1) __Energy savings.—__ 

        This section does not preclude the head of a federal agency from entering into a contract under section 801 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act ([42 U.S.C. 8287][/us/usc/t42/s8287]).

        (2) __Energy savings for military installations.—__ 

        This section does not preclude the Secretary of a military department from—

            (A) entering into a contract under section 2394  <sup>\[1\]</sup>  <sup><sup> 1 See References in Text note below. </sup></sup>  of title 10; or

            (B) purchasing electricity from any provider if the Secretary finds that the utility having the applicable state-approved franchise (or other service authorization) is unwilling or unable to meet unusual standards of service reliability that are necessary for purposes of national defense.
