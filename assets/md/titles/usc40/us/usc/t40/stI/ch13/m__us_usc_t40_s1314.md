    In subsection (a), the text of 40:319c(c) is omitted because of 1:1. In clause (3), the words “territories and” are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (b), the words “for a right-of-way or other purpose” are omitted as unnecessary.

    In subsection (c), the words “affected” and “concerned” before “a notice” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “chief executive officer” are substituted for “Governor” for clarity.
