    In this section, the words “government of a foreign country” are substituted for “foreign State or Government”, and the words “against a country” are substituted for “against any Government”, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “partnership, association” are omitted because of the definition of person in 1:1.

    In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “in this section or . . . other” are omitted as unnecessary.
