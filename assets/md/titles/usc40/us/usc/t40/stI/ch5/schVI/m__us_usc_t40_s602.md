    Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for “in respect of executive agencies, . . . consolidate, take over, acquire, or arrange for the operation by any executive agency of, motor vehicles and other related equipment and supplies for the purpose of establishing motor vehicle pools and systems to serve the needs of executive agencies” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (c), the words “mixed-ownership Government corporation” are substituted for “mixed ownership corporation” for consistency with chapter 91 of title 31. The words “chapter 91 of title 31” are substituted for “the Government Corporation Control Act” in section 211(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of [section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982][/us/act/1982-09-13/s4/b] ([Public Law 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], [96 Stat. 1067][/us/stat/96/1067]), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.
