    The text of 40:760(b) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 121(b)(1) of the revised title. The text of 40:760(c) is omitted because the authorization for fiscal year ending September 30, 1980 is obsolete and the authorization for “such sums as may be necessary” for succeeding years is unnecessary.
