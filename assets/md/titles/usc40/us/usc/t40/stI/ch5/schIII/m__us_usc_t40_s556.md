In subsection (a), the words “U.S. Army Corps of Engineers” are substituted for “Corps of Engineers” for clarity. The words “Secretary of the Army” are substituted for “Secretary” because of section 2 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33:2201).

    In subsection (d), the words “U.S. Army Corps of Engineers” are substituted for “Corps of Engineers” for clarity.
