In this section, 40:490(a)(7) is omitted as obsolete because the pneumatic tube system referred to in the provision is no longer used or maintained and 40:490(a)(9) is omitted as obsolete because the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.

    In subsection (c)(3) and (4), the words “without regard to the provisions of [section 278a of this title][/us/usc/t40/s278a]” and “which on June 30, 1950, was specifically exempted by law from the requirements of said section” (in 40:490(a)(5)), and the words “without regard to the 25 per centum limitation of [section 278a of this title][/us/usc/t40/s278a]” and “without reference to such limitation” (in 40:490(a)(8)), respectively, are omitted as obsolete because 40:278a was repealed by section 7 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1988 ([Public Law 100–678][/us/pl/100/678], 40:278a).

In subsection (c)(5), the words “Defense Industrial Reserve” are substituted for “National Industrial Reserve” because the National Industrial Reserve Act was renamed the Defense Industrial Reserve Act by section 809 of the Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1974 ([Public Law 93–155][/us/pl/93/155], [87 Stat. 617][/us/stat/87/617]), and transferred to 10:2535 by section 4235 of the Defense Conversion, Reinvestment and Transition Assistance Act of 1992, which was included as Division D in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 ([Public Law 102–484, title XLII][/us/pl/102/484], [106 Stat. 2690][/us/stat/106/2690]).

    In subsection (d)(3), the words “Federal Buildings Fund” are substituted for “Buildings Management Fund” because the fund established under 40:490(f)(1) is the Federal Buildings Fund and unexpended balances in the Buildings Management Fund were merged into the Federal Buildings Fund under 40:490(f)(3).

    In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words “[section 501 of title 36][/us/usc/t36/s501]” are substituted for “the Act of August 6, 1965, 70 Stat 1049” in section 210(a)(15) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of [section 5(b) of the Act of August 12, 1998][/us/act/1998-08-12/s5/b] ([Public Law 105–225][/us/pl/105/225], [112 Stat. 1499][/us/stat/112/1499]), the first section of which enacted Title 36, United States Code. In clause (1), the words “chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” are substituted for “the civil service and classification laws” because of [section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966][/us/act/1966-09-06/s7/b] ([Public Law 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], [80 Stat. 631][/us/stat/80/631]), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.

In subsection (f)(1)(A), the words “Defense Industrial Reserve pursuant to [section 2535 of title 10][/us/usc/t10/s2535]” are substituted for “National Industrial Reserve pursuant to the National Industrial Reserve Act of 1948 \[[50 U.S.C. 451][/us/usc/t50/s451] et seq.\]” because the National Industrial Reserve Act was renamed the Defense Industrial Reserve Act by section 809 of the Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1974 ([Public Law 93–155][/us/pl/93/155], [87 Stat. 617][/us/stat/87/617]), and transferred to 10:2535 by section 4235 of the Defense Conversion, Reinvestment and Transition Assistance Act of 1992, which was included as Division D in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 ([Public Law 102–484, title XLII][/us/pl/102/484], [106 Stat. 2690][/us/stat/106/2690]).

    In subsection (g)(1), the words “mixed-ownership Government corporation” are substituted for “mixed-ownership corporation” for consistency with chapter 91 of title 31. The words “chapter 91 of title 31” are substituted for “the Government Corporation Control Act” in section 210(a)(6) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of [section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982][/us/act/1982-09-13/s4/b] ([Public Law 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], [96 Stat. 1067][/us/stat/96/1067]), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.

 __Amendments__ 

    2006—Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 109–284][/us/pl/109/284] substituted “The Administrator of General Services may—” for “The Administrator may—” in introductory provisions.

    Subsec. (b). [Pub. L. 107–296, § 1706(a)(2)][/us/pl/107/296/s1706/a/2], in par. (1), inserted “and” at end, in par. (2), substituted a period for “; and” at end, and struck out par. (3) which read as follows: “furnish arms and ammunition for the protection force the Administration maintains.”

 __Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas__ 

    Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:

    Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies

    Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation’s wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.

    Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.

    The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:

    1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.

    (b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.

    (c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.

    (d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.

    2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.

    3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.

    This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.

    All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.

    This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.

    This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

                              William J. Clinton.
