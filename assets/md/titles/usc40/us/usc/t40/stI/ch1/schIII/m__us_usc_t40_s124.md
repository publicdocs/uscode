The words “heretofore or hereafter” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” are substituted for “Director of the Bureau of the Budget” in section 603(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 ([84 Stat. 2085][/us/stat/84/2085]). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by [section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982][/us/act/1982-09-13/s5/b] ([Public Law 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], [96 Stat. 1085][/us/stat/96/1085]), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
