            (A) the full name of the department, establishment, corporation, or agency that uses the vehicle and the service for which the vehicle is used; or

            (B) a title that readily identifies the department, establishment, corporation, or agency that uses the vehicle and that is descriptive of the service for which the vehicle is used; and
