    In subsection (b)(1), the text of 40:514(d) is omitted as executed and obsolete.

In subsection (b)(4), the words “chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” are substituted for “the civil-service and classification laws”, and the words “chapter 33 of title 5” are substituted for “the civil-service laws”, because of [section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966][/us/act/1966-09-06/s7/b] ([Public Law 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], [80 Stat. 631][/us/stat/80/631]), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code. In subclause (A), the words “in the United States” are added for clarity. In subclause (B), provisions related to the heads of executive agencies fixing the compensation of personnel outside the continental limits of the United States that were contained in section 404(c)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 are omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949 (ch. 782, [63 Stat. 972][/us/stat/63/972], 973) repealed the Classification Act of 1923 (ch. 265, [42 Stat. 1488][/us/stat/42/1488]) and all other provisions inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by [section 8(a) of the Act of September 6, 1966][/us/act/1966-09-06/s8/a] ([Public Law 89–554][/us/pl/89/554], [80 Stat. 632][/us/stat/80/632]), the first section of which enacted title 5, United States Code. The Classification Act of 1949 was reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5. See especially 5:5102 and 5103.

    In subsection (c)(1), the words “Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 ([22 U.S.C. 2451][/us/usc/t22/s2451] et seq.)” are substituted for “section 32(b)(2) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended” because of section 111(a)(1) and (c) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 ([Public Law 87–257][/us/pl/87/257], [75 Stat. 538][/us/stat/75/538]). The words “Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926” are substituted for “Foreign Service Buildings Act of May 7, 1926, as amended” because of section 8 of the Foreign Service Buildings Act (22:299). The words “(including [section 295b of title 22][/us/usc/t22/s295b])” are omitted as executed and obsolete.

    In subsection (c)(2), the words “Secretary of State” are substituted for “Department of State” because of 22:2651.
