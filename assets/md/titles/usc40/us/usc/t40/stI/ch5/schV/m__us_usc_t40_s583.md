    In subsection (a), the words “mixed-ownership Government corporation” are substituted for “mixed-ownership corporation” for consistency in the subsection and with chapter 91 of title 31. The words “chapter 91 of title 31” are substituted for “the Government Corporation Control Act” in section 210(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of [section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982][/us/act/1982-09-13/s4/b] ([Public Law 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], [96 Stat. 1067][/us/stat/96/1067]), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.

    In subsection (b), the words “salaries and expenses for preparing plans and specifications and for field supervision” are substituted for “salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in the preparation of plans and specifications or in field supervision, and for general office expenses to be incurred in the rendition of any such service” to eliminate unnecessary words.
