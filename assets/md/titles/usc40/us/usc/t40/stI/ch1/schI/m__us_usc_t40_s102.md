    In this section, the words “and in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 ([41 U.S.C. 251][/us/usc/t41/s251] et seq.)” are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words “this Act”, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under [section 111 of this title][/us/usc/t40/s111]. The definition of “Administrator” is omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:472(i) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of “person” in 1:1.

    In clause (6), the words “the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau” are substituted for “the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands” because of the termination of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. See 48:1681 note prec.

 __Amendments__ 

    2011—[Pub. L. 111–350][/us/pl/111/350] substituted “division C (except sections 3302, 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41” for “title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 ([41 U.S.C. 251][/us/usc/t41/s251] et seq.)” in introductory provisions.
