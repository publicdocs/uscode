    “(a) Appointment.—The Administrator of General Services, or an official of the General Services Administration authorized by the Administrator, may appoint uniformed guards of the Administration as special police without additional compensation for duty in connection with the policing of all buildings and areas owned or occupied by the Federal Government and under the charge and control of the Administrator.

    “(b) Powers.—Special police appointed under this section have the same powers as sheriffs and constables on property referred to in subsection (a) to enforce laws enacted for the protection of individuals and property, prevent breaches of the peace, suppress affrays or unlawful assemblies, and enforce regulations prescribed by the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator for property under their jurisdiction. However, the jurisdiction and policing powers of special police do not extend to the service of civil process.

    “(c) Detail.—On the application of the head of a department or agency of the Government having property of the Government under its administration and control, the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may detail special police for the protection of the property and, if the Administrator considers it desirable, may extend to the property the applicability of regulations and enforce them as provided in this section.

    “(d) Use of Other Law Enforcement Agencies.—When it is considered economical and in the public interest, the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may utilize the facilities and services of existing federal law enforcement agencies, and, with the consent of a state or local agency, the facilities and services of state or local law enforcement agencies.

    “(e) Nonuniformed Special Police.—The Administrator, or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator, may empower officials or employees of the Administration authorized to perform investigative functions to act as nonuniformed special police to protect property under the charge and control of the Administration and to carry firearms, whether on federal property or in travel status. When on real property under the charge and control of the Administration, officials or employees empowered to act as nonuniformed special police have the power to enforce federal laws for the protection of individuals and property and to enforce regulations for that purpose that the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator prescribes and publishes. The special police may make arrests without warrant for any offense committed on the property if the police have reasonable grounds to believe the offense constitutes a felony under the laws of the United States and that the individual to be arrested is guilty of that offense.

    “(f) Administrative.—The Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may prescribe regulations necessary for the government of the property under their charge and control, and may annex to the regulations reasonable penalties, within the limits prescribed in subsection (g), that will ensure their enforcement. The regulations shall be posted and kept posted in a conspicuous place on the property.

    “(g) Penalties.—

    “(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), a person violating a regulation prescribed under subsection (f) shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both.

    “(B) In general.—A person violating a military traffic regulation shall be fined an amount not exceeding the amount of the maximum fine for a similar offense under the criminal or civil law of the State, district, territory, or possession of the United States where the military installation in which the violation occurred is located, imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both.”
