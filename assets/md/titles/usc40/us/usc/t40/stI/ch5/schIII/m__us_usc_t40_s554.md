    (c) __Authority for Conveyance by the Secretary of Transportation.—__ 

        (1) __In general.—__

        (2) __Conveyance requirements.—__ 

        A transfer of property may be made under this section only after the Secretary of Transportation has—

            (A) determined, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, that the property to be conveyed is located in an area of serious economic disruption;

            (B) received and, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, approved an economic development plan submitted by an eligible grantee and based on assured use of the property to be conveyed as part of a necessary economic development program; and

    The deed of conveyance of any surplus real and related personal property disposed of under this section shall—

        (1) provide that all of the property be used and maintained for the purpose for which it was conveyed in perpetuity, and that if the property ceases to be used or maintained for that purpose, all or any portion of the property shall, in its then existing condition, at the option of the Government, revert to the Government; and

The Secretary shall reform, correct, or amend the instrument if necessary to correct the instrument or to conform the transfer to the requirements of law. The Secretary shall grant a release from any term, condition, reservation or restriction contained in the instrument, and shall convey, quitclaim, or release to the grantee any right or interest reserved to the Government by the instrument, if the Secretary determines that the property no longer serves the purpose for which it was transferred or that a release, conveyance, or quitclaim deed will not prevent accomplishment of that purpose. The release, conveyance, or quitclaim deed may be made subject to terms and conditions that the Secretary considers necessary to protect or advance the interests of the Government.
