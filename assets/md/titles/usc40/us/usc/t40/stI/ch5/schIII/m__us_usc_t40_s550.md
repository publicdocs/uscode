In subsections (b)(2), (c), and (d), the words “Secretary of Education” and “Secretary of Health and Human Services” are substituted for “Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare”, as appropriate, because of sections 301(a)(2)(P) and (b), 507, and 509(b) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20:3441(a)(2)(P) and (b), 3507, and 3508(b)).

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended”, and the text of 40:484(k)(4)(D), are omitted because the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.

    In subsection (e), the definition of “States” is omitted as unnecessary because of 40:484(k)(1)(D), restated in subsection (a).

    In subsection (e)(4), the words “this subsection” are used to reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(2)(C), the words “this subsection” should probably be “this paragraph”, meaning 40:484(k)(2). In the revised section, the reference to 40:484(k)(2) is translated as “this subsection” to reflect the restatement of 40:484(k)(2) as subsection (e) of the revised section.

    In subsection (h), the definition of “States”, is omitted as unnecessary because of 40:484(k)(1)(D), restated in subsection (a).

    In subsection (h)(1)(B), the words “National Park System Advisory Board” are substituted for “Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments” because of the amendment of 16:463 by [section 9 of the Act of August 18, 1970][/us/act/1970-08-18/s9] ([Public Law 91–383][/us/pl/91/383]), as added by [section 2 of the Act of October 7, 1976][/us/act/1976-10-07/s2] ([Public Law 94–458][/us/pl/94/458], [90 Stat. 1940][/us/stat/90/1940]).

In subsection (h)(2)(A), the words “this subsection” are used to reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(3)(A), the words “this subsection” should probably be “this paragraph”, meaning 40:484(k)(3). In the revised section, the reference to 40:484(k)(3) is translated as “this subsection” to reflect the restatement of 40:484(k)(3) as subsection (h) of the revised section. The words “or the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended” are omitted because the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.

    In subsection (h)(3), the words “this subsection” are used to reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(3)(B), the words “this subsection” should probably be “this paragraph”, meaning 40:484(k)(3). In the revised section, the reference to 40:484(k)(3) is translated as “this subsection” to reflect the restatement of 40:484(k)(3) as subsection (h) of the revised section.
