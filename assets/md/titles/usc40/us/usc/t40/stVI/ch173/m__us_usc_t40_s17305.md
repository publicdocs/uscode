The words “occurring heretofore or hereafter, but not prior to February 4, 1935” are omitted as obsolete. The words “United States Postal Service” are substituted for “Post Office Department or Postal Service” in section 3a of the Government Losses in Shipment Act (ch. 444), as added by [section 2 of the Act of August 10, 1939][/us/act/1939-08-10/s2] (ch. 665, [53 Stat. 1358][/us/stat/53/1358]), because of sections 4(a) and 6(o) of the Postal Reorganization Act ([Public Law 91–375][/us/pl/91/375], [84 Stat. 773][/us/stat/84/773], 783). The words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasury Department” because of 31:301(b).
