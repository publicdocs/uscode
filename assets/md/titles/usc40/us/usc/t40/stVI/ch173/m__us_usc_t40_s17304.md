    (a) __Presentation of Claim.—__ 

    When valuables that have been shipped in accordance with regulations prescribed under [section 17302 of this title][/us/usc/t40/s17302] are lost, destroyed, or damaged, a claim in writing for replacement shall be made on the Secretary of the Treasury.

    (b) __Decision of the Secretary of the Treasury.—__

        (2) __Replacement made by credit.—__ 

        When the Secretary decides that any part of the replacement can be made, without actual or ultimate injury to the Federal Government, by a credit in the accounts of the executive department, independent establishment, agency, officer, employee, or other accountable person making the claim, the Secretary shall—

            (A) certify the decision to the Comptroller General who, on receiving the certification, shall make the credit in the settlement of accounts in the Government Accountability Office; and

            (B) use the fund only to the extent that the replacement cannot be made by the credit.
