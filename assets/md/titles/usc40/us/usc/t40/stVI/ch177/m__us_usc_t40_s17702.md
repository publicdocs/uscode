    In this chapter, the words “or his designee” are omitted because of 10:113.

    In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words “and notwithstanding provisions of any other law” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “shall transfer” are substituted for “is authorized to and shall transfer” for clarity.

    In subsection (c)(4), the words “the Federal Field Committee for Development Planning in Alaska” are omitted because the Committee has been terminated. See Executive Order No. 11608 (eff. July 19, 1971).
