    In subsection (a), the words “federal agency” are substituted for “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government” because of the definition of “federal agency” in [section 17901 of this title][/us/usc/t40/s17901].

    In subsection (d), the words “notwithstanding any other provision of law” are omitted as unnecessary.
