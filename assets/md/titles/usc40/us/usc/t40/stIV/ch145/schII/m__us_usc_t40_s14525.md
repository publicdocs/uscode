## § 14525. State development planning process

    (a) __State Development Plan.—__ 

    Pursuant to policies the Appalachian Regional Commission establishes, each state member shall submit a development plan for the area of the State within the Appalachian region. The plan shall—

        (1) be submitted according to a schedule the Commission prescribes;

        (2) reflect the goals, objectives, and priorities identified in the regional development plan and in any subregional development plan that may be approved for the subregion of which the State is a part;

        (3)

         describe the state organization and continuous process for Appalachian development planning, including—

            (A) the procedures established by the State for the participation of local development districts in the process;

            (B) how the process is related to overall statewide planning and budgeting processes; and

            (C) the method of coordinating planning and projects in the region under this subtitle, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 ([42 U.S.C. 3121][/us/usc/t42/s3121] et seq.), and other federal, state, and local programs;

        (4) set forth the goals, objectives, and priorities of the State for the region, as established by the Governor, and identify the needs on which the goals, objectives, and priorities are based; and

        (5) describe the development strategies for achieving the goals, objectives, and priorities, including funding sources, and recommendations for specific projects to receive assistance under this subtitle.

    (b) __Areawide Action Programs.—__ 

    The Commission shall encourage the preparation and execution of areawide action programs that specify interrelated projects and schedules of actions, the necessary agency funding, and other commitments to implement the programs. The programs shall make appropriate use of existing plans affecting the area.

    (c) __Local Development Districts.—__ 

    Local development districts certified by the State as described in [section 14102(a)(2) of this title][/us/usc/t40/s14102/a/2] provide the linkage between state and substate planning and development. The districts shall assist the States in the coordination of areawide programs and projects and may prepare and adopt areawide plans or action programs. In carrying out the development planning process, including the selection of programs and projects for assistance, States shall consult with local development districts, local units of government, and citizen groups and shall consider the goals, objectives, priorities, and recommendations of those bodies.

    (d) __Federal Responsibilities.—__ 

    To the maximum extent practicable, federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities undertaking or providing financial assistance for programs or projects in the region shall—

        (1) take into account the policies, goals, and objectives the Commission and its member States establish pursuant to this subtitle;

        (2) recognize Appalachian state development strategies approved by the Commission as satisfying requirements for overall economic development planning under the programs or projects; and

        (3) accept the boundaries and organization of any local development district certified under this subtitle that the Governor may designate as the areawide agency required under any of those programs undertaken or assisted by those federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.
