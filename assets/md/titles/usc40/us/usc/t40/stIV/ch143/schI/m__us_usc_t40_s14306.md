    In subsection (a)(6), the words “any property” are substituted for “property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible” to eliminate unnecessary words.

    In subsection (a)(7), before subclause (A), the words “notwithstanding any other provision of law” are omitted as unnecessary. In subclause (C), the words “firm, association, or corporation” are omitted as being included in the definition of “person” in 1:1.

    In subsection (c), the words “Director of the Office of Personnel Management” are substituted for “Civil Service Commission” in section 106(5) of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 ([Public Law 89–4][/us/pl/89/4], [79 Stat. 8][/us/stat/79/8]) because of section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 (eff. Jan. 1, 1979, [92 Stat. 3783][/us/stat/92/3783]).

    In subsection (d), the word “amount” is substituted for “share” for clarity.
