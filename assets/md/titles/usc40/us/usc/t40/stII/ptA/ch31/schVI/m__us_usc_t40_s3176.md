The words “Sections 1535 and 1536 of title 31” are substituted for “section 601 of the Economy Act, approved June 30, 1932, as amended” because of [section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982][/us/act/1982-09-13/s4/b] ([Public Law 97–258][/us/pl/97/258], [96 Stat. 1067][/us/stat/96/1067]), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code. The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Public Buildings Administration” because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 380][/us/stat/63/380]), which is restated as section 303(c) \[303(b)\] of the revised title.
