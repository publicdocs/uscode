    In this section, the word “Mayor” is substituted for “Commissioners” \[meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia\] \[subsequently changed to “Commissioner” \[meaning the Commissioner of the District of Columbia\] because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, [81 Stat. 951][/us/stat/81/951])\] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act ([Public Law 93–198][/us/pl/93/198], [87 Stat. 789][/us/stat/87/789]).

    In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word “use” is omitted as included in “possession, control, and jurisdiction”.

    In subsection (b), the words “Secretary of the Army” are substituted for “Secretary of War” because of [section 205(a) of the Act of July 26, 1947][/us/act/1947-07-26/s205/a] (ch. 343, [61 Stat. 501][/us/stat/61/501]). Section 205(a) was repealed by [section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956][/us/act/1956-08-10/s53] (ch. 1041, [70A Stat. 676][/us/stat/70A/676]), the first section of which enacted Title 10, United States Code. Sections 3010–3013 of title 10 continued the Department of the Army under the administrative supervision of the Secretary of the Army.
