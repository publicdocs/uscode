        (1)  __Consultation__  __.—__ 

        The sponsor must consult with the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission regarding the selection of alternative sites and design concepts for the commemorative work.

        (2)  __Submittal__  __.—__ 

        Following consultation in accordance with clause (1), the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services, as appropriate, must submit, on behalf of the sponsor, site and design proposals to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission for their approval.

    (b)  __Decision Criteria__  __.—__ 

    In considering site and design proposals, the Commission of Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, and the Secretary or Administrator (as appropriate) shall be guided by, but not limited by, the following criteria:

        (1)  __Surroundings__  __.—__ 

        To the maximum extent possible, a commemorative work shall be located in surroundings that are relevant to the subject of the work.

        (2)  __Location__  __.—__ 

        A commemorative work shall be located so that—

            (A) it does not interfere with, or encroach on, an existing commemorative work; and

            (B) to the maximum extent practicable, it protects open space, existing public use, and cultural and natural resources.

        (3)  __Material__  __.—__ 

        A commemorative work shall be constructed of durable material suitable to the outdoor environment.

        The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts may develop such criteria or guidelines specific to each site that are mutually agreed upon to ensure that the design of the commemorative work carries out the purposes of this chapter.
