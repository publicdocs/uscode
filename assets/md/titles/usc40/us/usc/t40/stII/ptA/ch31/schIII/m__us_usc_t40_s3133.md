        (2)  __Person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor__  __.—__ 

        A person having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship, express or implied, with the contractor furnishing the payment bond may bring a civil action on the payment bond on giving written notice to the contractor within 90 days from the date on which the person did or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which the claim is made. The action must state with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the material was furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed. The notice shall be served—

            (A) by any means that provides written, third-party verification of delivery to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office or conducts business or at the contractor’s residence; or

            (B) in any manner in which the United States marshal of the district in which the public improvement is situated by law may serve summons.

        (3)  __Venue__  __.—__ 

        A civil action brought under this subsection must be brought—

            (A) in the name of the United States for the use of the person bringing the action; and

        (4)  __Period in which action must be brought__  __.—__

In subsection (b)(1), the words “may bring a civil action” are substituted for “shall have the right to sue” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “or sums” are omitted because of 1:1.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “to the contractor at any place he maintains an office or conducts his business, or his residence, or in any manner in which the United States marshal of the district in which the public improvement is situated is authorized by law to serve summons” are restated to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See H. Rept. 106–277, Part 1, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 4, 7.

    In subsection (c), the words “bring a civil action” are substituted for “sue” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
