## § 3113. Acquisition by condemnation

The Attorney General, on application of the officer, shall have condemnation proceedings begun within 30 days from receipt of the application at the Department of Justice.

    The words “the Secretary of the Treasury or any other” are omitted as unnecessary. The reference to section 258 is omitted because 40:258 is superseded by rule 71A of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App.: U.S.C.).
