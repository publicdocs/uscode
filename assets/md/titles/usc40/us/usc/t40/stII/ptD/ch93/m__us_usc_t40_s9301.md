    In this chapter, the words “Director of the National Park Service” are substituted for “Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital” and “director” because of section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and the Act of June 10, 1934 (ch. 38, [48 Stat. 389][/us/stat/48/389]).

    In this section, the text of section 1 (words before 1st semicolon) of the Act of May 21, 1932 (ch. 200, [47 Stat. 163][/us/stat/47/163]) is omitted as executed.
