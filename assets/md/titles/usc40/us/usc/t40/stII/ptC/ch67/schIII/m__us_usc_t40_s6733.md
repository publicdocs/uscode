    In subsection (a), the words “at such time as the Administrator and the Corporation agree but” are omitted as obsolete. The Corporation transferred its rights, title, and interest in all property to the General Services Administration on April 1, 1996. The words “Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center” are substituted for “building to be constructed on such property under [section 1104 of this title][/us/usc/t40/s1104]” because of [section 2 of the Act of December 22, 1995][/us/act/1995-12-22/s2] ([Public Law 104–68][/us/pl/104/68], [109 Stat. 766][/us/stat/109/766]).
