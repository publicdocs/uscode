    The words “The Congress further declares that” are omitted as obsolete. The word “Mayor” is substituted for “Board of Commissioners” \[subsequently changed to “Commissioner” because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, [81 Stat. 951][/us/stat/81/951])\] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Self–Government and Governmental Reorganization Act ([Public Law 93–198][/us/pl/93/198], [87 Stat. 789][/us/stat/87/789].)
