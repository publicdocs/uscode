## § 8125. Public spaces resulting from filling of canals

    The Director of the National Park Service has jurisdiction over all public spaces resulting from the filling of canals in the original city of Washington that were not under the jurisdiction of the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army as of August 1, 1914, except spaces included in the navy yard or in actual use as roadways and sidewalks and spaces assigned by law to the District of Columbia for use as a property yard and the location of a sewage pumping station. The spaces shall be laid out as reservations as a part of the park system of the District of Columbia.
