    The words “violation of federal or state law or any regulation under federal or state law” are substituted for “violations of any such laws or regulations”, and the words “unless the Metropolitan Police have been requested to do so by, or have received the consent of, the Marshal of the Supreme Court of the United States or an assistant to the Marshal” are substituted for “except with the consent or on the request of the Marshal of the Supreme Court or his assistants”, for clarity.
