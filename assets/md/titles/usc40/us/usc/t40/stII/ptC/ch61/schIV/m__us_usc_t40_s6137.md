    In subsection (a), the words “fined under title 18” are substituted for “fined not more than $100” for consistency with chapter 227 of title 18.

    In subsection (b), the words “Superior Court of the District of Columbia” are substituted for “Municipal Court for the District of Columbia” \[subsequently changed to “District of Columbia Court of General Sessions” because of sections 1 and 7 of the Act of July 8, 1963 ([Public Law 88–60][/us/pl/88/60], [77 Stat. 77][/us/stat/77/77], 78)\] because of section 155(a) of the District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act of 1970 ([Public Law 91–358][/us/pl/91/358], [85 Stat. 570][/us/stat/85/570]).
