## § 8123. Record of transfer of jurisdiction between Director of National Park Service and Mayor of District of Columbia

    When in accordance with law or mutual legal agreement, spaces or portions of public land are transferred between the jurisdiction of the Director of the National Park Service, as established by the Act of July 1, 1898 (ch. 543, [30 Stat. 570][/us/stat/30/570]), and the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the letters of transfer and acceptance exchanged between them are sufficient authority for the necessary change in the official maps and for record when necessary.

([Pub. L. 107–217][/us/pl/107/217], Aug. 21, 2002, [116 Stat. 1207][/us/stat/116/1207].)

    For transfer of functions from the Chief of Engineers to the Director of the National Park Service, see the revision note under [section 8102 of this title][/us/usc/t40/s8102]. The word “Mayor” is substituted for “Commissioners” \[meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia\] \[which subsequently should have been changed to “Commissioner” (meaning the Commissioner of the District of Columbia) rather than “District of Columbia Council” because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, [81 Stat. 951][/us/stat/81/951])\] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act ([Public Law 93–198][/us/pl/93/198], [87 Stat. 789][/us/stat/87/789]).
