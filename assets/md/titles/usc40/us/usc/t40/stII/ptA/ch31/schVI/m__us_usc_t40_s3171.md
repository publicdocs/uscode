## § 3171. Contract authority when appropriation is for less than full amount

    Unless specifically directed otherwise, the Administrator of General Services may make a contract within the full limit of the cost fixed by Congress for the acquisition of land for sites, or for the enlargement of sites, for public buildings, or for the erection, remodeling, extension, alteration, and repairs of public buildings, even though an appropriation is made for only part of the amount necessary to carry out legislation authorizing that purpose.

([Pub. L. 107–217][/us/pl/107/217], Aug. 21, 2002, [116 Stat. 1154][/us/stat/116/1154].)

    The words “On and after May 30, 1908” are omitted as obsolete. The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Secretary of the Treasury” \[subsequently changed to “Federal Works Administrator” because of section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, [53 Stat. 1427][/us/stat/53/1427])\] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 380][/us/stat/63/380]), which is restated as section 303(c) \[303(b)\] of the revised title.
