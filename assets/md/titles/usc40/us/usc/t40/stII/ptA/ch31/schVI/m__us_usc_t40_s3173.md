The Administrator shall establish rates to be charged to entities for which services are performed, in accordance with the plan.

    (c) __Deposit of Excess Amounts in the Treasury.—__ 

    At the close of each fiscal year, after making provision for anticipated operating needs reflected in the cost and capital plan developed under subsection (b), the uncommitted balance of any funds remaining in the Fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

    In subsection (b)(2), the words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Federal Works Agency” and “Public Buildings Administration” because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 380][/us/stat/63/380]), which is restated as section 303(c) \[303(b)\] of the revised title.
