    In subsection (a), the words “National Capital Planning Commission” are substituted for “National Capital Park and Planning Commission” because of [section 9 of the Act of June 6, 1924][/us/act/1924-06-06/s9] (ch. 270), as added by [section 1 of the Act of July 19, 1952][/us/act/1952-07-19/s1] (ch. 949, [66 Stat. 790][/us/stat/66/790]). See section 8711(f) of the revised title.

    In subsection (c), the words “but all such laws shall remain in full force and effect” are omitted as unnecessary.
