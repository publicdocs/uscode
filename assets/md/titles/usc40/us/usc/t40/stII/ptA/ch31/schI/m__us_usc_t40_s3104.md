    The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Supervising Architect of the Treasury” \[subsequently changed to “Secretary of the Treasury” because of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and to “Federal Works Administrator” because of section 301 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, [53 Stat. 1426][/us/stat/53/1426])\] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, [63 Stat. 380][/us/stat/63/380]), which is restated as section 303(c) \[303(b)\] of the revised title.
